There is a saying, [sn9, -s] Haste makes waste, [sn9, -s] in old times. It suggests that if you want to achieve something quickly, however [wd3, -s] you always can not get it. One of the reasons is that the everything in the world has its own regularity. We have to comply with it and can not change it. The national economic also has its own regularity. In previous time [np6, 2-], China wanted keenly to reach communisty [fm1,-] society early. However, it have [vp3, 1-] made our national economic [wd2, 2-] develop slowly, and to some extents [wd3, 2-], it did harm to [vp1, 1-4] our national economic's [fm2,-] development. Today our government adopted the open and reform policy. Our national economic [wd2, 2-] become [vp3, 3-] apparently better than ever. The people's living conditions are much improved.

That haste makes waste is known to everyone in China. Whatever we do, we must remember it. There are some reason [np3, 1-] for it. First, when someone is haste [wd2,-], he hasn't enough time to think what he should do and how he should do. So it will cause somebody does [vp1, 2-] what he needn't do. Then he will waste his time and get nothing. On the other hand, haste makes people not know [wd1, 2-] how to do [sn8, s-]. So people will do everything. But [wd3, -s] all will reach nothing. Second, haste will make people's mood bad. When someone is in bad mood, he willn't [fm2,-] do a good thing, so what he has do [vp9, 1-] will be waste. For example, studing [fm2,-] English can't haste [wd2,-]. If someone is hurry [vp9,1-] to make his English level [wd5, 1-] progress fastly [fm2,-]. He don't [vp3, 1-] begin from base and willn't [fm2,-] learn English well.

When someone is filling a bottle with water, and he is impatient, so [wd3, -s] he makes [wd3,s-] it quickly but most of the water is [wd3, -2] dropped out of the bottle. Obviously he needs more time and becomes slower [sn6, s-]. Like this, [sn9, -s] we call, [sn9, -s] Haste makes waste. Then, why do [vp3, -s] haste makes [vp9, 2-] waste. Firstly, I think, haste can makes [vp9,1-] people upset, and then influence his [pr3, s-] acts. Secondly, once people haste [wd2,1-1], he [pr3, s-] can not control his activeness [fm2,-] well and does things in wrong ways. For instance, someone is haste [wd2,-]to get train [cc3, 1-]. The time is rather limited, so he is upset, he takes his suitcase [wd4, s-] hurried to the railway station. [sn1,s]When he arrives at the station, he finds his ticket is forgotten [wd3, s-] in his home. Such examples are many. [sn8, s-] And in order to avoid it [pr1, s-] and make things good and quick, we should not haste and we ought to make calme. [fm1,-] [cc3, 1-]

A proverb says "haste makes waste". It says very well. Every thing has its own way. Someone wants to do well in it [pr1, s-], he must grasp the principles which are in the things.

There is a famous say [wd2, 2-] that haste makes waste. In short, if one wants to finish his work as possible as he can, he will make the work even worse on the contrary [wd5,s-].

"Haste makes waste" is a principle. If you hurry to do something, you can't do it well. Perhaps, you run into these case [np3, 1-] [cc3, 3-].

As a proverb say [vp3, 2-]: Haste Makes Waste. It's quite clear that a haste people [np3,2-] [cc4, 1-] can't make achievement because he [pr3, s-] hasn't prepared enough. It [pr2, -s] is known to all of us. No one can deny the proverb. Haste makes waste. For example: [sn9, -s] a very young baby, as we all know, can't walk very well. He walks slowly. He throws himself to the ground now and then. However, his mother let [vp3, 2-] him run to her. He can't reach to [vp1, 1-] her without any help. Every one learns to walk in childhood.

There is a famous saying "Haste makes waste". But why? There are some reasons for that. First, we have no time thinking about the thing, [sn9, -s] before we start to do it because of haste. Second, sometimes we have to do it again because of the lackless [fm2,-2] of care. Third, it may take us much more time to do a thing with haste than do it carefully. Finally, we would waste a lot of time and money because of haste. For example, when we go to school, we would bring the book and other thins [wd3, -] such as glasses. But we forget to bring the glass before [wd3, -] of haste. We have to return home for it. For another example, we haste [vp1, -3] do the thing again when we did [vp6, s-] it wrong.

Some people like engaging in one kind of job consistently. In Easten [fm1,-] World, such as China, Japan, most people hold this opinion. It is partly influenced by the national culture. These people aren't pleasant [wd3,s-] to change. All they want or persuit [fm1,-] is a stable and peace [wd2,-1] life. So they do a job only to earn money to leave [wd3,-1] on, even they don't interested [vp9,1-] in what they're doing. To them, that's enough. Whether these people like their job or not, they are sure to try their best to do everything well. We can often see that people always serve one company in loyalty through their lives. Unlike the people above-mentioned [fm2,-], some persons change their job constently [fm1,-]. For instance, most Americans are the typical examples. They hate?stationery".

In their views, changing is reasonable. In my opionion [fm1,-], people have free right to chose [vp5,4-2] a job. Nowadays, people should change with the world. In keen [wd3,-1] competitive society, people should think more about survival. So I think, the correct attitude to chose [vp5,2-1] job [np6,1-] is that: [sn9,s-] everyone must select [wd3,-2] one position that he or she is interested in and compatable [fm1,-] to. In the position, you're confident that you can do it much better than any other. Of course, you should be qualified for it first. So whether you change your job or not, [sn9,s-] is not important. The critical thing is that you can do your work well and you're sure that it is the just work you need.

I think when one is young, he can try some different jobs that he like [vp3,1-], but he may not change too often and must select [wd3,-1] one of them [pr1,s-] to work. After that he will do the job very hard. It's a good way to me.

When we go any length to do something, We care for not only the speed but also the quality. In some sense, the latter is of more importance to us. If we pursue the high speed when we do some work, we may be ignorant of the quality. However, the quality is the very thing we are after. Cite an example. In 1980's, most of the developing countries were after the high speed of economic growth in order to exceed the developed countries. They made many economics [wd2,-1] policys [fm1,-] referring to [wd3,1-] how to improve the speed of economic growth. Because they neglected the quality of economic growth or economic development, they had a poor harvest. 1980's was called the lose decade of developing countries. Some developed countries which shown [vp4,s-] more importance on the quality of economic growth made progress. In a word, we'd better pay attention to both speed and quality, voiding [fm1,-] the waste taken place in the pursuit of speed. [sn8,s-]

  The word?Haste makes waste?is very reasonable. The word says that if we do every thing, we should step by step. [sn8,s]then [fm3,-] we can be succeed [wd2,-]. We know, [sn9,s-] that every thing according to it's own order.[sn8,s] We can't change it [pr1,s-]. We must obey it. If we don't, we can do nothing. For example, once there lived a farmer, he was worried [aj1,2-3] to see that the crops were very small, then he pulled the crops from the land.

  "Haste makes waste" is an old saying of our country. It contains two meanings.One is that if you want to succeed, you should firstly be patient. The other is if you are too impatient, your goal will otherwise difficult to reach.[sn8,s] The reason of "haste makes waste"[np1,-]is that only hard work lead [vp3,1-] to success and to complete a hard work needs a long time. [sn8,s-] You may want to be a teacher in your childhood. Certainly you couldn't turn your dream into practice [wd3,3-] in one night. You must learn Arithmetic [wd3,1-], Chinese, physics and other basic course [np3,2-] in your primary school, and high school. Then after years of above mentioned knowledge's study you will learn how to make a student learn fastly [fm2,-] and well in the Normal university. [sn8,s-] Then after your [wd2,1-1] graduated [vp6,-s] from the Normal university, you really become a teacher. You will see how it is to reach a goal, to catch a success [cc3,2-]. Contrastly [fm2,-], if you raise a purpose [cc3,2-] today to be teacher, and you want to teach in the classroom tomorrow. [sn2,s] Can't you imagine how you will teach and how much the students will know you? "Where there is a will, there is a success". This is another Chinese old saying, work hard and patiently, you will get your purpose in the end.[sn1,s]

  As we know,"Haste makes waste"[np1,-]refers simply to the faster one does, the fewer one gets, [sn7,s] why ? Because no matter what we do or will do, we must conform to the natural law. If we breach [wd3,s-] it, the natural law will punish us. Finally, we aren't not [wd5,1-] only advance a step, but also back a step. [sn8,s-] For example, the wheat grows too slow, it must grow by using of [wd5,1-] necessary water, sunshine, soil. If one want [vp3,1-] it to grow faster and pull it higher, the wheat will dead due to loss enough water, soil. [sn8,s] It [pr1,-s] is also right in economic field. In 1956, [wd4,-3] Chinese government want [vp3,1-] to make more iron, and take all steal of whole country to product [wd2,s-] the iron. It result [vp3,1-] in the consequence that producted [fm1,-] iron was almost substandard product, [sn8,s-] in the meantime, the steal was also used up.

[sn8,s-] So when we do anything, we should comply with the natural law.

?Haste makes waste ?is a common truth. The development of anything is a process of making progress. It is from the low to the high. [sn8,s-] If we want to get a success., we must work hard. But it is not enough to work hard. We have to consider the conditions we have. Only we have the necessary conditions, we maybe [wd5,s-] get a success. Or our efforts will waste [vp7,2-].

  ?Haste Makes waste? mainly means that someone eager to get something but can't reach it in the end. [sn8,s-] Why? Because everything has it's own develop [wd2,-1] stage. And each of them can't be avoided. For example, when we study something, first we must have a general look at it. Then through learning it we slowly understand it. At last we waste it. There are three stages, we shall do it in sequence. It is impossible to reach the third stage without the first and the second stages. We should do everything quickly and well.

[sn2,s] If some thing in it [wd5,1-] is failure, we would have to do it again. It would need more time. So we can say "Haste [fm3,-] Makes [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-]."

In order to read it [pr3,s-] fast, we read each passage quickly and can't understand what it means. When you finish reading it and the other man asks what it says, perhaps you can say nothing.

There is a kind of general idea to say that haste makes waste. [sn8,s-] I think it is true. Once a man want [vp3,1-] to succeed through the way of rapid speed, he will not realize his dream. During the courses of haste, you may forget many factors important to your work, and you have only an idea to succeed in a short time. What you can't think of is if you spend less time in working or studying, moreover [wd3,s-], you can't think over the problems relevant to the work, you will not get at your purpose.

For example, when you study English, you wish to remember the words quickly, so you read quickly and are anxious of mastering them in a short time. However, you get lower efficiency. You can't realize your idea [cc3,2-]. Then, you waste much time in remembering such words. We shall think over the words, then remember them. By means of this, we can succeed quickly.

  What is "Haste [fm3,-] Makes [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-]"?[np1,-] It implies that if one wants to do something more quickly, he may get the inverse [wd3,-1] consequence.

  "Haste Makes [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-]" is a proverb, which express [vp3,3-] that preparation is helpful before you do a thing, and haste perhaps doesn't do good for the thing. You may ask why. Now I think everyone wants to complete a thing sooner,  but if you don't investigate it ahead and make preparations for it, you will not do it effectly [fm2,-]. On the contrary, you have to hurry and [wd4,-1] anxious, but can't do it well. Now I will give you an example to express [wd3,s-] it. You know I am a student. I want to get a good record. Once I stayed at classroom for long time a day. I studied without necessary rest. I went to bed so late. Because I wanted to be a "good" student. But in the end of the term, I always feel headache and other sick feelings too. [sn8,s-] Of course my study didn't improve. Through this fact, I know I couldn't haste, I must study gradually and prepare the course exactly.[sn1,s] "Haste Makes [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-]" is a truth. Please remember it when you do everything.

But in 1990, the former has increased to sixty years old and the latter has gone down to about 100 deaths per 1,000 births. Why they have changed too much? There are mainly two reasons.

First, in recent years, many developing countries have made rapid progress in their economy. People's living became better and better.

It goes without saying that there are many reasons about this. First, I think, is the progress in science and the development of technology. With the progress of socity [fm1,-], people's living conditions are improvement [wd2,-]. Because of these, life expectancy rises and infant mortality has reduced.

Which is a [np7,-1] excited [aj4,-1] thing. It can prove that the living conditions of the developing countries is [vp3,s-] getting better. The reason of the great change is the developing of technology and industry of those countries, especially the technology. In 1960 many developing countries was [vp3,1-] very poor.

[sn8,s-] It goes without saying that the health is very important. With the development of modern science and technology, more and more people are concerned about [vp2,2-] their health.

However, there was [vp3,1-2] 100 death [np3,1-] per 1000 births in 1990.What causes these changes? I believe it is mainly because of the increasing economic [wd3,1-]. As a result, the medical machines and all kinds of medicine are more useful. Doctors also made a great progress on [wd3,1-2] their skills. When a infant or a old man is unhealthy, they can receive better cure [wd3,s-]. What's more there are much more things to make people healthy than before, in other words, [sn1,s-] there are many kinds of foods. The third reason is that the protect, [wd3,1-] and predict [wd3,1-] work is done better than the past years [sn4,s-]. People realize that the infants and the old men should be given more love. I believe the life expectancy will be higher and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] will be lower in the future because of the increasing economic [wd3,1-].

Infant mortaility[fm1,-], which is 250 deaths per 1000 births in 1960, has decreased to about 100 deaths per 1000 births in 1990. The reasons that caused the improvement include so many [wd4,1-], the most important one of which is economy.[sn1,s] In these years, the developing countries emphasised [fm1,-] economy very much and had made many policies and means [cc3,4-] to develop their economy. With the development of economy, the medicine of these countries improved [vp7,s-] so much. Furthermore, the goverments [fm1,-] also pays [vp3,1-] more attention to the peoples living.

Now, let's look at the graphs of life expectancy and infant mortality in developing countries from 1960 to 1990. First, take a look at the life expectancy. In 1960, the age of the whole society [wd3,1-] was from 0 to 40 or so [wd7,s-]. While in 1990, the age ranged from 0 to 60 [wd7,s-], obviously, the life of a man [wd7,s-] has increased. Secondly let's see the graph of infant mortality. In 1960, there were about 250 deaths per 1000 births, however the rate of infant deaths decreased a little more in 1990. On the average, there were nearly 100 deaths per 1000 births at the [wd5,-] most. Why it has changed so obviously? In my opinion there are various kinds of reasons that lead to [wd3,1-2] the change. On one hand, so [wd5,-s] the living conditions are improved, due to these [pr1,s-], the number of sickness decline [vp3,3-]. Thus the life increase [vp3,1-] [cc2,2-].

[sn8,s-] It [pr1,s-] showed [vp6,-s] that life expectancy of developing counties was delaying [wd3,1-] by 20 years old in the 30 years. The second graph showed [vp6,-s] that infant mortaility [fm1,-] was nearly 200 deaths per 1000 births in 1960 and 100 deaths in 1990.

Why the life expectancy and the infant mortality were increased [vp7,s-] so fast in developing counties? I think the first reason is that people's living standard is developing quickly. By [wd3,1-] the standard conditions increased people began to realize the a [wd5,1-] healthy [wd2,1-] of [wd4,-2] own body. [wd4,-3] Second reason is that goverments [fm1,-] of developing countries paid more attention to people's publish [wd3,1-] and mental living [wd7,1-] and healthy [wd2,-].

If a person wants to get to the top quickly, and he's in a hurry, he does not want to walk step [wd4,1-1] step, even if he has got to the top, he may fall down. Only because the base is not steady.

From 1960 to 1990, [wd5,s-] in 1960, life expectancy was 40 years old, [wd4,s-] infant mortality was 200 per 1,000 births, but in 1990, the life expectancy was 60 years old, [wd4,s-] the infant mortality reduced to 100.
What causes this change? I think there are two important reasons. One is that the living level in the developing countries is rising. People can spend much money on food, living conditions, the other reason is that the governments have take [vp9,1-] some measures to better the people's health, every year they'll take out much money to set up hospitals and train many medical persons.[sn1,s-] I think, with the development of the word [wd3,s-], more and more people will live long [aj3,s-].

Since 1960, in many developing countries there have been great changes in life expectancy and infant mortality. In 1960 life expectancy was 40 years old and infant mortaility [fm1,-] was 200 deaths per 1000 births. But in 1990, life expectancy was 60 years old, and infant mortality was 100 deaths per 1000 births in developing countries of [wd3,3-2] the world.
What caused these great changes? I think there are several reasons as follows. Firstly. In [fm3,1-] 1960, because many developing countries gained independence not long ago, they couldn't have money to develop their economy, but after 30 years, with the help of the world the people in these countries make rapid progress.[sn1,s-] Not only economy but also everything have developed greatly. The people's living conditions have improved a lot. Secondly. [sn9,s-] In 1960 some developing countries had [wd3,s-] wars with each other. At that time they couldn't develop their economy. But now the world is very peaceful, they can develop their economy, build their countries.[sn1,s-]
I think with the help of the government [np3,s-], hard [cc4,-1] people in developing countries will also have a good life.

The illustration showed us that life expectancy in 1960 was fourty [fm1,-] and it became sixty in 1990. We also knew from the illustration that infant mortaility [fm1,-] was 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960 and it became 100 deaths per 1,000 births in 1990. 
From these changes we realized that life expectancy was raising [wd3,s-] and infant mortality was becoming low [aj3,s-]. The reason for these changes existed [wd3,s-] in two points. First, material life [cc2,1-2] was increased in developing countries. Second, mental life [cc2,1-2] was increased too. For instance, in many developing countries, people couldn't feed [vp1,-2] for themself [fm2,-] in 1960. They often had not enough food to eat. They lived a bad life. But in 1990, with developing technology, they had enough food. They lived a happy life.

According to the table [wd3,s-], the expectancy has increased from 40 years old to 60 years old, on the countrary [fm1,-] the infant mortality is decreased from 20% to 10% in developing countries in the past 30 years. The following is the reasons that cause the variation. 
Firstly, with the development of society, people can get more nutrious [fm1,-] food such as meat, egg and so on to eat. This helps old people live longer and infants became [vp4,s-] healthier.
Secondly, medical equipments [np5,-] develop quickly in these countries. When a person feels ill, he can go to a hospital and have a check. By this means [vp1,2-s-] he can know what illness he gets and be [vp4,s-] cured more quickly than in the past. As for an infant, before giving birth to it, its mother is checked, when it is born, it was injected.[sn1,s-] In this way it can avoid being ill.
The last reason is that people have more time than ever. In their free time they can do more exercise to keep themselves heathy [fm1,-]. If a mother is healthy, her baby is probably healthy too.

In developing countries, people work hard to make life [wd3,1-]. Their health is worth worring [fm1,-].
The life expectancy of developing countries in 1960's [np4,s-] was 40 years old. The infant mortaility [fm1,-] in [wd3,-2] that time [ad1,s-] of developing countries was two hundred deaths per one thouthend [fm1,-] births. Why? The important reason was that the food was not enough to [wd3,3-3] so many people in 1960. And the developed contries [fm1,-] took hold of [cc3,2-3] the world econimic [fm1,-], that made the [wd5,2-3] most developing countries's [np4,-] people [wd4,s-] in deep trouble.

As is know [vp9,1-] [wd4,s-] above [wd1,s-] the chart given in Chinese [sn8,s-], the life expectancy was 40 years old in 1960. After 30 years, the life expectancy had increased to 60 years old.

This is a chart about the life expectancy and the infant mortality. From this chart we can see the variety [wd7,s-] of the life expectancy and of the infant mortality. For example, in 1960, the life expectancy is expected [sn8,s-] to [wd4,s-] 40 years old while it is sixty years old in 1990. Similarily [fm1,-], the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960 whears [fm1,-] it is decrease [vp9,1-] by 100 in 1990. In 1990, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
The above fact is brought about by different factors. For one thing, it is related to the progress of science and to the increase of the people's living standards. In [wd4,-2] old days, people didn't know how to use some useful things such as man-made product. Their food is mainly from wild plants and animals. Nowadays, people not only manufact [fm1,-] synthesis [wd2,1-1] febel [fm1,-] but also refine [wd3,s-] some useful things from wild plants and animals.

We can study [wd3,s-] that during 1960, the people's life is very short. The highest life expectancy is 40 years old. And the infant mortality is also higher [wd3,s-], which comes to the numbers [np3,-3] of 200 deaths per 1,000 births. But, in 1990, these situations change [cc5,-1] largely.

Why this variation taken [vp9,3-1] place? [sn8,s-] By [pp2,-4] my view of point, first is the development of economy.

But contrary [pp2,-2] to that, the infant mortality decreases when it compares with 1960's. In 1960 the infant mortality is 200 deaths per 1,000 births, while in 1990, it is 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
Perhaps you may ask what's the reason. In my opinion, it is largely due to the development of economic [wd2,2-] in developing country [np6,2-]. The standards of life are improving. People have a strong body. In addition, with the development of economic [wd2,2-], the medical conditions are improving accordingly. More and more hospitals are being put up. What's more, they began to own modern medical facilities, whenever a child or adult gets sick, he will receive an immediate attention.[sn1,s-] I think it is the reason.

In developing countries, the life expectancy and infant mortaility [fm1,-] had changed a lot during the past thirty years from 1960 to 1990. As for life expectancy, in 1960 it was forty years old. It increased sixty years old till [wd3,s-] 1990. On the contrary, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] was 200 deaths per 1000 births in 1960 and decreased 100 deaths per 1000 births. Why did it occur [vp1,3-2] this situation?
First, I thought that the standard of living had improved [cc5,-2] very much. In 1960, human being [np3,s-] depended on the corn, less vegetable and eggs. However, in 1990, they lived on milk, eggs, more vegetable and fruits and so on.
Second, it is the good medicine and conditions in hospital. In 1960, the woman usually had baby at home where there is no doctor or nurse. They could only depend on themselves. Till [wd3,s-] 1990, they would go to hospital before they had baby [np6,1-]. The woman would be treated by doctors and nurses, so the infant mortaility [fm1,-] was only half that in 1960.[sn1,s-]
Besides these two reasons above, there was [vp3,1-2] other reasons.

Such eminent [cc4,-1] changes [wd4,s-] mainly because of two aspects [wd3,s-].

The reason that causes the huge exchanges [wd3,s-] lies in three points. First, there is a fatastic [fm1,-] spurt of the productivity in many developing countries during these 30 years. Since many countries carry out the economic reforms, the people's living standards are higher and higher.

The changes in life expectancy and infant mortality lies [vp3,8-] in some reasons. First, in the 1960's, most developing countries had gained the victory of revolution, with the victory, they developed their technology, which effected the medicine, so the infant mortaility [fm1,-] declined and the people's life expectancy increased .[sn1,s-] Secondly, people have more money to develop [wd3,-2] their diet.

It's well-known that, today the developing countries develop rapidly, not only the development of industry, agriculture but also medical cases [wd3,s-], trace [wd7,-1] cases [wd3,s-], etc. The society is becoming rich, and many [np8,-4] advanced healthy [cc4,-1] equipment are [vp3,1-] set up.

In developing countries, on the average, people's life expectancy averaged 40 years old in 1960, while in 1990 people's life expectancy rapidly increases by 50 years old. The other issue that attracts our attention to [wd5,7-] is that infant mortaility [fm1,-] is on the decline to ten percent in 1990. [sn9,s-] against [sn8,s-] twenty-five percent in 1960. With time passing, people's life expectancy still [ad1,-1] will prolong [vp1,1-1] and infant mortaility [fm1,-] still [ad1,-1] will be on the decline.
There are some reasons for the changes. in [fm3,-] [pp2,-3] the one hand, people's physical life [wd2,-1] standard is gradually being raisen [fm2,-]. With socialty [fm1,-] developing rapidly, in [pp2,-3] the other hand, people change their mind [np6,1-] step by step, [sn1,s-s-] because [fm3,s-s-] of it [pr1,s-] people know how to prefect their bodies, and they know how to take care of their infants, and so on .[sn1,s-]

Health gains in developing countries have gained the important notion [wd7,s-] of the world. Now, let us give a back [cc4,-1] look on [wd3,s-] the life expectancy of the developing countries in 1960 and 1990. In 1960, life expectancy is 40 years old. In 1990, life expectancy is 60 years old. During the long 30 years, life expectancy rises by 20 year [np3,2-]. Infant mortaility [fm1,-] also proves a truth [wd7,s-]. In 1960, infant mortaility [fm1,-] is 20 percent. In 1990, it is 10 percent. From the truth we can draw a conclusion that the developing countries have made rapid progress in man's health.
Now let us find the reasons. First, also the most important, maybe in recent years, developing countries have gained independence, and have made rapid progress in national industries etc. These countries can have healthy [cc4,-2], developed hospitals. People of the countries are also concentrating on good and healthy food. Second, in recent years, many countries have formed a lot of birth policy [np3,4-], and they can get a lot of good things.

From the upper [wd3,-1] chart we can see that the life expectancy is creasing [fm1,-]. From 1960 to 1990, the Developing [fm3,-] countries [np4,-2] life expectancy is improving from 40 years old to 80 years old. At the same time, the Infant [fm3,-] mortaility [fm1,-] is decreasing too [wd5,s-] from 1960 to 1900. it's [fm3,-] deaths ratios has decreased from 250 deaths per 1000 births to 100 deaths per 1000 births.
Why do life expectancy crease [fm1,-] and infant mortality decrease in the these years in developing countries? There are two reason [np3,1-] about it.
The first reason is that medical level is improving in developing countries. People can have a good medical condition. when people are sick. [sn2,s-] A good medical level can bring [vp1,-s-] infant mortality declining and people life extending. Now, In [fm3,-] developing countries, As [fm3,-] technology developing [vp4,s-], The [fm3,-] medical level becomes more and more advance [wd2,3-], which make people live longer.

First, let us look at the figues [fm1,-] above. Both of [wd5,1-1] figues [fm1,-] inform us the difference between [wd4,s-] in 1960 and 1990. In 1960, the life expectancy in 40 years old while in 1990, the life expectancy is 60 years old. The infant mortaility [fm1,-] is 200 deaths per 1,000 births but in 1990, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is 100 deaths per 1,000 births. Apparently, the life expectancy rises while the infant mortaility [fm1,-] reduces. It is a good news [np5,2-].
The reasons of these changes are: First, because of the development of country [np6,s-], the living conditions are improved. Second, the medical conditions are improved. The [wd5,s-] third, the secince [fm1,-] is developed [vp7,3-1] quickly, it make [vp3,1-] many fields develop fast, these fields include medicine, living environment and so on .[sn1,s-] All make [vp3,1-] people live longer and make infant die [cc5,-1] smaller.

From the change we can conclude that the developing countries have maken [fm2,-] great progress over [wd3,s-] the 30 years. What's the reason?
Since 1960, the developing countries have take [vp9,1-] many measures in economic development, environmental protection. With the economic development, the medical care is developed too. At the same time, the stander [wd3,1-3] of the consumer [wd2,4-] is increased. These are the very reasons.

In 1960, the life expectancy was very low. Nobody could live over 60 years old. The life expectancy was 40 years old and or so. But the infant mortality was very high. The infant mortality was about 200 deaths per 1,000 births. However, In [fm3,-] 1990, the life expectancy increased. The average of the life expectancy was about 60 years old. And the infant mortality decreased. It was about no more than 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
Why did it [pr2,s-] take place so many changes.[wd1] [sn9,s-] Because the medical circumstances have developed [sn9,s-] which ensures the babies [np4,-1] births. What's more, people have enough money to buy what they want to eat and which [pr5,s-] will be well [ad2,s-] for their health. So great changes have taken place.

[sn8,s-] Compared with 200 per 1000 births in 1960 the number of the deaths only was 100 in 1990.
Why happened these changes? [sn8,s-] Firstly, developing countries have provided [cc3,-2] some policy [np3,1-] to insure [wd3,2] people's health, they improved people's live [wd2,-1] levels according to [wd3,s-] advancing the productivity.

In 1960, both the economic [wd2,1-] and the tecnology [fm1,-] in these countries are poor, they could not provide enough food and chemical [np6,s-] for their people, so the life expectancy is only 40 years old and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is 200 deaths per 1000 births .[sn1,s-] With the development of the periods [wd7,s-], these countries have took [vp9,1-] on a new look. they [fm3,-] have revolutions in science and economic [wd2,3-]. now [fm3,-], people have enough money to buy better food and chemical [np6,3-], and now, their opion [fm1,-] of health is changed.

One, after the [wd5,-3] world [fm3,-2] war II, nearly all developing countries in the world have switched their attention to develop [vp5,5-2] their economics [wd2,s-]. First products have been produced. Then people's life in developing countries is much better than before, as a result people will live longer than before and infant mortality is sure to decline.[sn1,s-]

In 1960, life expectancy at most reaches 40 and in 1990, it reaches sixty. At the same time, we can know that infant mortaility [fm1,-] in 1960 was high [aj1,-3] to percent 20 [wd1,1-], however, until 1990, it decreased to percent 10 [wd1,1-].[sn1,s-]
What caused the changes in developing countries?
The [wd5,s-] first, I think, is the increase in their people's life standard. In recent years, the developing countries have made great progress in their economic [wd2,2-]. So, people have benefited from it and increase their nutrition.
Secondly, medical [wd2,s-] has a rapid development which helps people to live long and make it possible to decline the death of infants.

For example, from 1960 to 1990, life expectancy had been raised from 40 to 60 years old, and infant mortality had declined to half of the past [wd7,s-]. So, less [np8,-1] infants are facing death and people live longer and longer.
The change comes from the two important development [np3,2-] during [pp2,-2] the past, food and medicine.

 From the chart given above, we can see that there are obvious changes that take place in life expectancy and infant mortality in developing countries. To life expectancy, the average age was 40 years old in 1960, however [wd3,s-] 60 years old in 1990. While to infant mortality, in 1960, it reached 200 deaths per 1,000 births, but to [wd3,1-1] 1990, it decrease by 50%.
What caused this to happen? First, with the development of developing countries, people become richer, and More [fm3,-] and more people can afford to see a doctor when they are ill.
Second, Governments pay more attention to people's health. For example, governments provide [vp1,-4] much money on medicine, setting up special hospitals.
All this leads to health [wd7,s-] of the developing countries.

What on earth causes these changes? There are two main factors: First, people's life is changed, the food is enough, few people die from hungry [wd2,2-], and with the increase of food, people become [vp9,-1] pay more attention to the nutrilist [fm1,-] structure of food, which invoied [fm1,-] many diseses .[sn1,s-]

What causes the changes? I think that it [pr2,s-] has three reasons: firstly, the people's living level was greatly improved with the development of technology, people can produce more and more highly nuturious [fm1,-] food and pay attention to their diet's structur [sn1,s-]; Secondly, medical institutes have been set up in recent years. it [fm3,-] applies [wd3,s-] people with all sorts of medicine and keep up their health; [sn6,s-] thirdly, people can take part in all kinds of relaxation.

The reason that causes the transformation [wd3,s-] may lie in three aspects. Firstly, with the development of the society, the people's life standards increases [vp3,1-]. So many people can buy good, [sn9,s-] food such as meat, fish, eggs, chickens. Secondly, the government pay [vp3,2-] attention to the health of the people, they offer some money to increase [cc3,-2] the conditions for the people's health, for example, they built some hospitals .[sn1,s-] Finally, people often take part in some activities, [wd4,s-]playing football, table-tennis and so on.

In [pp2,-3] the same time infant mortality has been decreased [vp1,-s-] about 200 deaths per 1,000 births to about 100 deaths per 1000 births.
What caused these changes? I think they can be due to [wd4,1-2] following facts.
First, most developing countries have been developing their economy. Their economy has been improved. So the government had enough money to eastablish [fm1,-] public facillities [fm1,-], such as hospital, health centre and so on.
Second, people begin to care about their life. They have enough money to improve their living condition and food quality. They often took part in sports in their spare time.

What may account for the change of life expectancy and infant mortality in developing countries? In my opinion, this change is largely due to the development of developing countries economy.

But the reality isn't so grateful. In fact, we are very short of fresh water. As we know the population of the world is more than five billion.

We should make laws to control the birth rate and to prevent indurstry [fm1,-] from lay [vp5,3-3] out [wd3,1-] dirty water to the lake directly. On the other hand, we should take measures to make the dirty water clean and we can use it again.

Many people think that fresh water can't be used up. The rivers flow year and [wd3,1-1] year. And in many places, it rains a lot. In many cities, water is supplied any time if wanted on a very low price. It seems we have too much water to use it up.
In fact, there is a serious shortage of fresh water in the world. The water consumption increases rapidly because of the progress of population and the development of industries. In addition, lots of water sources were polluted and couldn't be use [vp9,1-]. It is the [wd5,-2] high time for us to solute [wd3,s-] this serious problem.

Many people think that Fresh [fm3,1-1] Water will never be used up. Fresh waster comes from rain, river, and so on. Those people think that since rain and river-water [fm2,-] will be used for ever, Fresh [fm3,1-1] Water will also be used for ever.
In fact, Fresh [fm3,1-1] Water is in a global shortage. Firstly, with the increase of population, the number [cc1,-3] of Water [fm3,1-1] Fresh [wd1,1-] to be used increase [vp3,s-], too: More and more Fresh [fm3,1-1] Water is used to [wd3,s-] people's life.

Otherwise [wd3,s-], global shortage of fresh water is also because of the increasing population.
So what can we do to solve the problem? First, we may [wd3,s-] not waste the fresh water. Second, measure [np6,s-] should be taken to keep the water from poluting [fm1,-] [vp7,s-]. Above all, we may have a right situation [wd7,s-] to the shortage of fresh water.

"Haste makes waste" is an old saying of China. Often [ad1,-3] people want to finish something more quickly, but often [ad1,-3] they can not do it well. If someone seeks the speed when he is doing something, he (she) usually pay no attention to everything around him that can affect what he is doing. Furthermore, he (she) can not concentrate on doing the things and make a mess of his project. Thus, the things he (she) has done is in bad quanlity [fm1,-], even nothing good can be found in the things.[sn1,s-] That is, he (she) wastes time doing everything for he (she) seeks for haste. In our life, such example can be found easily. For example, during our country's construction, if we ignore all things around her and are eager to make our country develop more quickly and can't do it step by step, we will not succeed. Many things have proved it. So we can conclude that we mustn't seek for haste only but carry out everything step by step when we are doing them, otherwise we won't do everything well.

Haste make [vp3,1-] [vp1,s-] you can't think [cc3,-4] about the thing enough, haste may make you excited or nervous, so you can't think carefully about what you must do, what you mustn't do and what method will be the best.[sn1,s-] Or you may forget something important, it make [vp1,-2] you can't do what you will do sucess [fm1,-].
For example, one morning you get up later [ad3,s-], and you will be late to [wd3,s-] your work, so you are hasted [fm2,-]. you [fm3,-] run down the stairs and run to your car then you find that you have left the key in the room.

"Haste Makes [fm3,-1] Waste" is on old saying. It tells us that you should not be impatient and worried when you want to finish something as quickly as possible. Meeting a difficulty thing, first you should think about it carefully, second you should do something to prepare for it, so you will get a good effect after you begin to do it.[sn1,s-] Otherwise, you will not attain the aim that you expect.
For example, if you want to get [wd4,-2] a place by bicycle, but there is something wrong with the bicycle, before you begin using it, and you don't fix it.[sn1,s-] So it will not work probably on [wd5,-3] the half way to the place, finally you will be late or can't get there.

"Haste makes waste", is one of the traditional and old precepts. However, some people do not think that it is true or they think that it is true but do not act on it. So it's necessary to illustrate and demostrate [fm1,-] that haste makes waste.
In everyday life, we often have to do many things in limit [wd2,1-1] time, and we have to catch [cc3,-2] the time. If we want to do them as quick [wd2,3-] as we can, we will become nerveous [fm1,-] and won't finish them in time. So haste makes us nerveous [fm1,-] and disable us to do many things well. Some workers who get up late and have to go to work on time usually make things worse. They may forget to look [vp1,1-2] their house or to bring the key with them or to make their clothes well [sn9,s-] which often produces many jokes.

The old saying "haste makes waste" [cc2,s-] is very familiar to us. I think maybe everyone knows the reasons well. First, one that wants to haste [wd2,s-] in a hurry often can't stop to think about the best way to success. He always takes the wrong way and tries hard without any rewards. Second, while in a hurry, [sn7,4-] he can't make the most of the helpful conditions which may accelerate his success. Third, as is know [vp9,1-] to us, a good rest is very important for one to reach success. Whoever keens [wd3,1-2] on success will neglect [wd3,s-] rest and do everything ineffectively.

For example, Li Ming, one of my classmates, who want [vp3,7-] to get a good mark on CET 4, spared every moment to study English. In the morning after he gets up, he began [vp6,s-] reading English with a piece of bread in his hands. In any class, he didn't listen to the teacher and did his English exercises. At noon, he read English book again without having a rest. At night, he often stayed up to [wd3,2-2] 12 o'clock. However, about half a month later, he fell ill and couldn't read English again. Due to the coming of the CET [sn9,-1] 4 test, he kept studying. Unfortunately the day before CET [sn9,-1] 4 test he passed out [wd7,s-] and couldn't attend the exam.
In general, we must keep calm in front of success, consider [cc5,-2] everything well and think out a best way to success.

People always thinks [vp3,2-] that finishing things as fast as you can is a good thing. Is it the case? I say" No! Haste makes waste."
In some cases, we have something important to do, but we have not enough times [np6,s-], for example, we want to finish a drawing which have [vp3,4-] to be turned in.

Perhaps the line isn't straight. or [fm3,-] else [wd5,s-], you like plantting [fm1,-], but the tree can't brings [vp9,1-] [wd3,s-] up in days.

Every one should be patient when he does work. On the other hand, we couldn't work well without patience. When somebody does his work hastily, the more he want to haste [wd2,s-], the more he couldn't do [cc5,s-] his work with patience. As a result he could never success [wd2,2-] his work as he want [vp3,1-]. For example, when we want to fixture [wd2,-2] a bicycle, we should do this with patience. Otherwise we must spent [vp9,1-] more time doing it on the contrary we want. [sn8,s-]
Also [ad1,s-], when we want to work hastily, we couldn't concentrate on doing it. This is the [wd5,s-] why haste make [vp3,1-] waste too. For example we want to read a book quickly, thus, we couldn't spent [vp9,1-] more time concentrating on it. So we couldn't get comprehension of it, and we couldn't get what we want.
We can work well with the brieve [fm1,-] that haste makes waste.

We often make this fault, when we do something, we always hope it finish more better [ad3,1-] more sooner [ad3,1-]. [sn8,s-] This mood makes [vp1,-2] us going [wd3,s-] in an anxious state. So our minds can't work effectively. The progress of the work is slow [vp9,1-1] down. Then, we became more and more anxiously [wd2,4-]. The terrible circle [wd7,s-] is formed. Haste makes waste.
There are a lot of examples in our daylife [fm1,-]. When I must face to [wd5,3-2] the final-exam [fm2,-], I have to review [cc3,-3] all the knowledge what [pr5,s-] I have learned in this term. With the examing [fm1,-] day coming fast [wd3,s-], I still have many works to do. I hope these things were done quickly, but I have not so much time. I'm busy in doing this and that, but nothing is well done. I can't finish one thing if I still stick to use [wd2,2-] this method. I must understand haste makes waste and cool down. I must start from one thing and finish it before I have to [wd5,1-2] another thing. Only in this way, I can make my study effectively [wd2,3-].

A provd [fm1,-] says, "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste". It means that sometimes people are anxious to achieve some thing, but because of carelessness or the other reason [np6,4-], they usually fail in the end.

The phenomenon often happen [vp3,3-] in people's everyday life, for instance, three years before [wd3,2-3] when I studied in [wd3,-2] high school. I wanted [wd3,s-] to go home on bicycle every other weekend. Once it being dark, I'm so afraid of being caught in rain that I drove [wd3,s-] faster and faster. But in the cross-road [fm2,-], I was injuried [fm1,-] slightly, when the bicycle was turned over. To make the matter worse, the parcel of books on the back of bike [np6,1-] was unwrapped and all books were scattered into apects [fm1,-]. It took me half an hour to pick up them [wd1,2-]. At last, it was still [wd3,s-] at seven in the evening when I arrived at house [np6,2-]. Therefore, when we wanted to finish some thing in a short time, we must make [wd7,-5] good caution [wd4,-1] do [wd3,s-] with accidents. Only if we do so, we can [wd1,s-] attain our aims.

Haste makes waste. When someone haste [wd2,s-] in a work, he may be much [ad3,s-] careless than usual. So some mistakes will be made by him, which just waste [vp3,s-] his time at work.
For instance, in ancient China there is [vp6,s-] a scholar planned [vp4,s-] to enter a city before sunset because the city door would be closed then. Judged from the distance, it was possible for him to get there with [pp2,-2] normal speed. But he just hasted [fm2,-], and the books on the back of his horse which he drove [wd3,s-] fell to the ground. After he piled [wd3,s-] up the books, it [pr2,s-] was not enough time to reach the city then. So he wanted to haste [wd2,s-] just waste time. [sn8,s-]
For another example, you must catch a train in 2 hours. And it is only one and a half hours' walk from your home to the railway station. But you haste [wd2,s-] and are too careless to take something important with you. When you remember it on the way and have to fetch, time is wasted.

"Haste Makes [fm3,-1] Waste" is a saying that is used often by people. But why we say" Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste"? [sn8,s-] There are two meanings in it. [wd7,s-] The first is people are too eager to make [cc3,-1] success, the second is people make acts [wd7,1-] when they don't find out good ways.[sn1,s-] At [pp2,-2] this condition, good wishs [fm2,-] always don't bring good effect.
For example, in 1950's, the people in China were too eager to make our country in to [fm2,1-] a strong mordenizational [fm1,-] country, our leaders adopted the strategy of "The [fm3,-] great leap". This strategy was very unthoughtful [fm2,-]. So this strategy didn't bring our country advicements [fm2,-], but also destroied [fm2,-] [cc5,-4] our country very much. We should remember this lesson forever.
"Hates [wd3,-2] Makes [fm3,-1] Waste" make [vp3,3-] our many regrets [wd7,3-], we should make [wd3,s-] lessins [fm1,-] in our life and stuies [fm1,-].[sn1,s-]

Many people want to do something very quickly, and with little of [wd5,2-1] difficulties. But, in fact, they can't realize [cc3,-2] their aims. There is a raison [fm1,-]: Haste makes waste. Firstly, we must consider [vp1,-2] of the situation where we are. We can't do something that [cc2,1-3] is impossible to manage. Secondly, we should be patient. When we want to [wd4,1-1] something quickly, we often lose patience, and this will make our work more difficult. Finally, there are many other causes, such as capablity [fm1,-], money, circumstance, help from other people. If we are impatient, we usually lose our heads [wd3,2-] and can't think of them [pr1,s-]. So, all we try to do will becomes [vp9,1-] a kind of waste, a waste of force of man, a waste of money and a waste of time.
It is not difficult for us to find out the examples around us. A student doesn't study well, but he want [vp3,1-] to catch up with the others in a short time. So he does his best to realize it. Times [np6,-s] passes away [wd3,2-], but he finds he can't do so. So he will be discouraged, and can't study as hard as before. It's only a simple example, there are many others in our vie [wd7,2-].[sn1,s-]
So, when we want to do something, we must remember the sentence: Haste makes waste. And we can realize what we want to do much more facile [wd2,s-] and possible [wd2,s-].

People always say "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Wast [fm1,-]," and I think it is very reasonable.
Whichever [wd3,s-] we wanted to do, we should do it step by step and can't [wd4,-1] impatient. If we always complete it in very [ad2,-1] haste, we often make many mistakes even fails [wd2,2-].
For example, we study English, if you want to grasp this language in few [np8,-1] time and I think it is impossible of [wd3,2-1] you to learn it well, because English as a subject you should know English new words by heart, [sn8,s-] study English grammer [fm1,-] and practice [cc3,-3] English spoken abilities and so on, and all this must spend your plenty [wd3,s-] time in grasping [vp1,-1].[sn1,s-]
So, I think "Haste make [vp3,1-] waste" is a good guidance for us to do anything.

Some people think that we must do everything as quick [wd2,3-] as possible, but is that be [wd5,2-1] so? We all know the proverb Haste [fm3,-] makes waste. It tells us that sometimes speed is not the most important things [np3,s-].
First, we should do our homework before what we are going to do. Whether we prepare enough or not directly influents [wd2,s-] our outcome. Good prepares [wd2,1-] need a certain [wd5,1-1] time. Second, the more quickly we do a thing, the more mistakes we are going to make. For example, once doing a [np7,-1] experiment, [sn8,s-] I wanted to finish it in a very short time.

Some people often like doing things quickly. They think the more quickly they do a thing, the more wonderful consequence they will get. But it is not the case.
Why haste makes waste? [sn8,s-] Because when you want to finish an important thing in a quick way, you always can not think of [wd3,1-3] a correct way or a wonderful method carefully. And something always can not be well done without the correct way. For example, you want to go to the Great Wall for a visit. You have longed for it. And you hope to go there immediately. So you forget to take some necessary things with you, for example medicine. When you reach the Great Wall, and unfortunately get a fever; [sn9,s-] you have no medicine to overcome it. Finally you can not visit the beautiful scene on the Great Wall.

Some people admire quickness. They believe doing things quickly means high efficiency. But I don't think it is always the truth.
In my opinions [np3,2-], haste usually makes waste. Because, as to the subjective [wd3,-1] world, everything has its own principle of development. They adherent [wd2,1-1] to the principles, which means we should pay good [cc4,-1] attention to the principles. Everyone who breaks the rules will surely fail. On the other hand, as far as man is concerned, haste sometimes leads to the nevious [fm1,-] state. So the things which we should have easily accomplished become difficult.
Furthermore, we always think less in order to do things quickly. All the reasons will cause failure.

One of the old sayings says: "Haste makes waste." There are two reasons for it. First, things must be done step by step.

Second, If [fm3,-] you want to finish doing something quickly, you must be too nervous to work properly. As a result, you will fail eventually when you ignore some necessary steps or do something wrong.
Almost everyone has such experience. For example, A housewife will often forget to light a fire before cooking when she wants to prepare a meal in a short time. Or she will probably add some sugar into the dishes instead of salt. When these things happen, She [fm3,-] must do it again. That's called "Haste makes waste."

Why does haste make waste? There are several reasons. First, we always need some indispensible [fm1,-] preparations before we manage to finish a task. It seems that these work [np3,1-] are unnecessary, but they are often essential for the success in the future. On the other side, If [fm3,-] we want to reach our goal, we must follow the right instruction properly. That is, we must carry out the procedure step by step. Sometime [wd3,s-], even if you omit a minor step, the whole thing will fail and you have to start all over again from the very beginning. In fact, it is a waste of time to finish work in a hurry and come out with [wd3,2-4] a bad outcome. I remember that once I wanted to finish an experiment ahead of time so that I could attend a party on time. I omitted some steps which I considered "not important". The result turned out to be a bad one. I made a mess of my experiment and had to do it once more. At the same time, I missed the party.
So, we can draw a conclusion that haste can cause failure and fault. If we want to save our time, then, don't do things in a hurry. Follow the right way and you can get the best results.

As a long [cc4,-1] saying, haste makes waste. [sn8,s-] Many people believe this because they have experienced so much. So much failures have told them that "haste makes waste." On many occassions [fm1,-], we may need to do things of our own time, [wd7,4-] but on [pp2,-2] the end, we may fail because we do them in a hurry.
What [pr5,s-] did this happen? First, haste makes us impatient, and there are more chances that we do [wd3,-2] some mistakes. Second, we may neglect some important things. Furthermore, haste to some extent causes [cc3,-2] more time, more energy and even more material.

This is much important in the chemistry field. One day, I was asked to make some medicine solve in 500ml water. In addition, the water must be added more and more [wd3,3-].

Although this idiom is known widely, people tend to haste [wd2,s-] spontaneously or unconsciously. For example, in the ancient China, a farmer was anxious with his crops.

Haste makes waste, is an old Chinese saying. It means if you hurry to do something, you will often fail to get to the desired goal.
The reason [cc2,s-] may be the following two points. First, when you are in a hurry, you can't get every thing ready before you begin the job. So you'll find something necessary has been forgotten when you are doing the job. And you have to return to the beginning. Second, if you are [wd4,-1] hurry, you must be impatient. When you met with something unexpected, you won't deal with it with a patient heart. And the difficulty will often can't [vp9,2-] be solved.
There are many examples that can prove the saying. The following is a simple one. A boy was afraid of going to school late so he did every thing in a hurry. When he get [vp3,s-] to school, he found he had forgotten to take the homework which will be handed on [wd3,1-]. So he had to return home to get the homework. Because he was too hurry [wd2,s-] to get the homework, he was late at last.
The saying tells us that before you want to do something successful [wd2,2-], you won't [wd3,s-] do it in a hurry. It's better for you to think it over before you do it.

People often say," Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste". On some occasions, though we want to get one thing done well and quickly, it turns out that we fail [vp1,-2] to it. It is true that sometimes haste makes waste. The hastilier [fm2,-] you get along with [cc3,2-2] a thing, the more waste time you will get. [wd7,s-]
Why does haste make waste? Because you can't make a full preperation [fm1,-] for the thing you are going to do in such a short time. Then you have to turn back and do it again. Thus you will spend more time on the thing, than before. Therefor [fm2,-], "Haste makes waste."
There are some examples on this case. For instance, once when I was in an exam, I wanted to finish the paper quickly, so I did not hear what the teacher had told the student [np3,s-]. As a result, I made a wrong understanding of the question and failed the exam.
In a word, when you are about to do something, you must do it after a full consideration. Otherwise you will lose [wd3,s-] it. Don't forget, "Haste makes waste".

When one meets difficulty, he will be afraid. It is the same as haste. [wd7,s-] Since he was afraid, how could he do something well? He would always do it badly [sn9,s-] even lead something to be no valuable. [wd7,s-] [sn8,s-] Moreover, while one is haste [wd2,s-], he may want to do something in another [wd3,1-1] ways. Since he is haste [wd2,s-] to change his minds. In general, he can't do it well. So we say "Haste makes waste".
For example. [sn2,s-] If we want to pass CET-6 exam, we must prepare it carefully, so we must start to prepare it long before. But if we want to pass it yet just prepare it hastely [fm2,-], of course, we can't go over most of the books carefully. As a result, we [cc2,s-] might be difficult to pass it.

So you must do it quickly in order to play with your friends. After several days, you will find many errors in your homework. You can't help asking: "why? I should haven't [vp9,1-] made these mistakes." It is eagerness makes you do them. [sn8,s-] People can't do anything perfectly in eagerness [wd4,s-] even in anxiety. Psyologists [fm1,-] also suggest eagerness don't [vp3,1-] mean good lucky [wd2,1-].
So we should work regularly. Because we can do everything better without the psyological [fm1,-] pressure. [sn2,s-]

Haste makes waste, calmness makes use [wd7,2-].[sn1,s-]

It often [ad1,-2] can be seen that someone is too eager to do things ahead [wd3,s-], but they fail in the end. Why does this happen? There are some reason [np3,2-]. Above all [wd4,s-] is that most of them haven't prepared well for their work. Then when they meet some problem [np3,1-], they don't know how to do. Secondly, chance does not come frequently.

To the peasents [fm1,-], haste may be bad for their harvest. The crops would die if they want them to grow too fast. As for workers, if they proceed [cc3,-2] the production too fast, the production [wd2,-3] with bad quality would come out. As students, we should haste [wd2,1-] in our study. The knowledge can't be absorbed in a few days. It needs years of hard work.
So we mustn't haste [wd2,1-] when we do anything. But it is not equal to that we can slow down our speed because of lazy [wd2,1-] or other reasons. We need to do well prepare [wd2,2-] and want for [wd5,s-] the chance. When the chance comes, we shall work with patient [wd2,1-]. Thus we can succeed and save our time, money and energy.

The Chinese idiom, haste makes waste, means that the willing [wd2,1-] to save time often results in a waste of time. It orginates [fm1,-] from an old story. Once there was a king who should return to his palace to deal with something in a short time. Firstly he rided [fm2,-] a horse and kept spuring [fm1,-] it in order to get [wd4,s-] earlier. But he was so anxious that he thought the horse run too slow [wd2,2-]. Then he jumped down from the horse back [fm2,1-] and walked on foot. The result is obvious that he wasted much time.
From this story we know: uder [fm1,-] some emergent circumstances in order to save time we easily become anxious and lose our sensiability [fm2,-], we forget so many convention [np3,2-] that we can't give [wd3,-3] a right decision. Haste makes us anxious and anxious [wd2,1-1] makes us unsensitible [fm2,-] which leads to a waste in the end.
We must keep a calm head [wd3,3-] under any circumstance. Please rember [fm1,-] "Haste makes waste".

We all know the old saying, "Haste makes waste". But why? As we known [vp4,2-], hurry comes along with haste. [wd7,s-] When you want to finish a thing as quickly as possible, you have little time to think over [vp1,1-3] how to do it efficiently, [wd4,s-] how to make full use of materials.

It is well-known that haste makes waste. This words [np3,1-] indicates that if you want to do something in a hurry, finish it earlier than before, you will get nothing at last.

People often say "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste!" Why? There are several reason [np3,2-] on [wd3,1-1] it. First, when one wants to do something quickly, he can't think it over and arrange [vp1,-3] how to do it well. So when he does it, he doesn't know what's the best means and how to do it effectiently [fm1,-]. 
Second, when he does something rapidly he does it without thinking and is careless in doing it. As a result, the faster he wants to do something, the worst [ad3,s-] the result is.
For instaince [fm1,-], my uncle is a man who likes to do anything quickly. But he often fails. One time [wd3,1-], he wanted to chang [fm1,-] the windows' glass in his house. The seller asked him to bring them back twice because they broke easily. But he didn't accept the advise [wd2,1-]. He laid the pieces of glass after his bike. As a result on his way home, the glass fell down and broke to pieces. My friend is also a man like that. Once he wanted to let a bottle of beer cool quickly so he put it into the refertior [fm1,-].

"Haste makes waste." That's a famous Chinese saying. Its means, that we should do everything step by step and with the correct method, otherwise, we'll labor in vain.
Here is an example, if we want to get [wd4,-2] some place in an unfamiliar city, what should we do first? Go down the street and look for the place? No, we should stay at some place for a while and study a map carefully, then, decide, where we should go. In this way, we can get to our destination more quickly.
On the other hand, in our daily life, we should do everything from the start [wd2,1-1] point, and do it step by step. When we want to do something, good prepairation [fm1,-] is necessary.

There goes a well-known saying "Haste makes waste". It means people sometimes disire [fm1,-] to do thing [np6,s-] quickly but finally find that it takes much more time than [wd4,s-] expected. Why haste makes waste? [sn8,s-] I think there are main reasons as [wd4,-1] following: [sn8,s-] Firstly, when people want to finish their work as soon as they can, they always ignore some details of the work. When they start working, what was [vp6,s-] not expected happens, and they will not be able to solve the problem smoothly. Secondly, when people work quickly [sn9,s-] they are likely to make more mistakes and perhaps some mistakes can not be corrected. All these will take up much time.
For instance, suggest that you have only a little time to go to work. You do not eat your breakfirst [fm1,-] at table but take it to your car. Then you drive very fast to your office and sit down on your table. When you begin to work you find your files are left at home. It will take you more time to solve the problem.

There is a famous Chinese saying "Haste makes waste." Some people are always trying to do things in a hasty way in order to save time. But in fact, they often have to spend more time. Why is [wd4,s-] the case?
Firstly, those people set out doing things without a plan. Thus they don't know what important task should be finished at the beginning. Secondly, they are anxious to save time, without a plan, so they can't get along step by step. Furthermore, the result of their work won't be fine in such a hasty way.
Most things we do in our daily life proves [vp3,s-] the saying right. For instance, when the Chinese teacher asks students to write a composition, many students begin writing without a plan. Obviously, those students want to write an article quickly. But without a well organized constructure [fm2,-], the students especially beginners aren't able to write a precise, coherent composition.

The path of the understand [wd2,2-1] of the scioety [fm1,-] through the intermediate [wd2,-] between people, the service of the scioety [fm1,-], Through these paths, we can contact varitious [fm1,-] of people and something that we have ever contact [vp9,4-] before. So the necessary [wd2,2-1] of [pp1,-3] understand our scioety [fm1,-] is very important.Base on these causes, I think I know what I should do. My way is: First, I will pay more time to notice what happens around me, and care [cc3,-1] someone who care for me, give my service to everyone who needs my [wd5,-] help. Sooner or later, I will understand the scioety [fm1,-] through [pp2,-2] this way.

There are many reasons about this. One reason is that they have already adapted [vp1,-s] their working conditions, and loved [vp6,s-] them. Another is perhaps that it is not necessary to learn the new technology. On the other hand, some people like changing their jobs frequently. One reason is that the new job is full of exicting [wd2,-] and challenging [wd2,-]. Another reason is that they can enrich their experience. In the new environment, a person must study and work hard.

I think neither doing one job nor changing work frenquently [fm1,-] is well [wd2,-]. When you do a job well, let you go into a new condition. Everything is new. It is impossible for you to do it well in a short time. On the contrary, you always do one job.

<ST 4>  <band 6> <title Charm>    Charm is one complicated feeling you get from another person. You would like  to contact with a charming human, even you love him(her) and want to make  friends with him(her). In daily life there are so many persons you have to face, and  you could be aware of the difference of charm among them. Though charm is one  real feeling that everyone knows, it's hard to tell why one person is charming but  another not. So I want to set an example which is helpful to discover the causation.    In my living environment, my most charming person is my tutor. Before I  became his student, I knew little of him and just heard that he was a famous  economist. At that time tutor was just an abstract existence and my feeling to [pp1,-] him was neutral. Keeping contact with my tutor for one year, [sn3,-] he has been more and more charming to me. I like him so much that I would like to work for him without  any payment. Of course not only myself but also many other persons including  many local and central leaders think he is charming.    Then I ask myself why my tutor is charming? Because of his being handsome, or  his great academic achievement? I think these are not main reasons, in fact his most  attracting [cc4,-] feature is his noble spirit. [sn1,-] He works hard for people' life and the national development. He engages himself to seek a powerful road of China at the expense of his health and family happiness. Besides, another important reason is that he is kind to persons especially his students.     From the experience from [pp1,-] my tutor, I conclude that charm comes from a person's  characters which could be divided into external characters and inherent characters.  External characters such as pretty appearance and repute could bring on charm,  many young fellow admire famous singers and film stars who are usually pretty or  handsome.[sn1,-]  But those are not the most important reasons, in fact, the charm from external characters could not last a long time. [sn1,-] The real and most important reason of charm comes from inherent characters such as temperament, ability, spirit.  Napoleon was ugly, but he had marvelous talent and strong volition, and he was so  charming that many people adore him two hundred years later after his death..[sn9,-] On the contrast, if a man has handsome appearance, but he is ugly, short of  perseverance and useless to society, then would you think he has charm?      One person should not complain his being absent of charm because his parents  haven't given him handsome face and graceful stature. Since charm comes from  inherent characters, you could get charm through your efforts. Cultivate your  temperament [cc3,-], train your ability [cc3,-] and educate your mind [cc3,-] day after day, then you would become more and more charming. [sn1,-]  My dormitory  I live in a very small dormitory, Room 604 in Building 26. It is only about 10  centimeters, crowded with three double beds, one bookcase, one desk and three  students including me. 	Our dormitory is not only a small one but also a disordered one. Once you  burst through [vp2,-] the door (we often forget to lock it up) and came into the room, you will not consider the room as a student's dormitory. [vp6,-] This is because you can not find anything formal. The three beds seems [vp3,-] widely divergent [wd3,-]: The first bed you will see on the left hand is covered with a gray and dusty mosquito-curtain [fm2,-] throughout the year, which [pr1,-] is so opaque that nobody can dope out whether or not there is any people in it. On the right hand, the bed is quite different from the first one, it is too neat and clear to be impressive. [sn1,-] Behind the first bed, the bed close to the window is mine. [sn8,-] My bed is always filled with a lot of books like rubbish, I can't deal with them, so I have never been living in my bed for several mouths [fm1,-].

<ST 4>  <band 6> <title Democracy>  There are few words which are used frequently than the word "Democracy" on  the world political stage. What does it mean? It means literally rule [np5,-] by the people (from the Greek demos, "people", and kratos, "rule" ). It means that tyranny, the hotbed of warfare, give [vp3,-] place to parliaments where laws are made, independent  courts of justice in which over long periods those laws are maintained, and  dependable governments in which people's rights are ensured. That is Democracy--and in its soil grow continually freedom, comfort and culture. When Democracy reigns in any country, a wider and civilized life is afforded to the masses of the people. The central principle of Democracy is the subordination of the ruling authority  to the settled customs of the people and to their will as expressed through the  Constitution.  There are three ways to show Democracy. At first, a form of government or  other authoritative office in which the right to make political decisions is exercised  directly by the whole body of citizens, known as direct Democracy. Secondly, a  form of government or other authoritative office in which the citizens exercise the  same right not in person but through representatives chosen by and responsible to  them, known as representative Democracy. Finally, a form of government or other  authoritative office in which the power of the majority exercised [vp7,-] within a  framework of constitutional restraints designed to guarantee [vp2,-] all citizens the rights  such as freedom of speech, religion, body, etc, known as liberal Democracy. In our country we have today achieved in a high degree the blessings of  Democracy, there is freedom; there is law; there is a widening prosperity.[sn1,-]  
<ST 4>  <band 6> <title Classification of Human Beings>  Broadly speaking, all human beings can be divided into three classes, although  everyone is unique. They are, namely, utilitarian, ethical and aesthetic person [np6,-].  The first kind of people includes both materialist and most of the politicians. They  always stick firmly to money or potency and may do every thing in order to get  them [pr1,-]. So one can say they do not have any failure in their life. Because of this they are shortsighted and not likely to make great achievements in their life. They rarely have any trusty friend and they are not loyal even to their best friends. Compared with them, people belonging to the second class are most suitable to be one's  friends. They are always faithful to whatever they think they should do according  to the morality, no matter how meaningless they are essentially. They may harm  someone from prejudice. Sometimes they may even do something greatly harmful  to the society because of their prejudice. While the third kind of people think  nothing is worthy for them to be faithful all their lives. They are prone to accept  new things in the world. Though are called aesthetic people [sn3,-], always seeking the meaning of everything, they feel sad and lonely in most of their life.  It is useful for a person to know which class he belong [vp3,-] to in order to live happily together.

Mr Zhang was very responsible and always spent a long time preparing his class,  so his class was interesting and impressive. He carefully reviewed our assignments  and marked mistakes in them. As to our puzzles, he patiently explained them till  we understood. Therefore, we all love him and his class.   Furthermore, Mr Zhang gave special attention and support to those who didn't do  well in English. I also benefited from his kindness. At first, my English was very  poor and had difficulty keeping up with other students [sn8,-]. Gradually,I lost confidence and regarded English study as my insurmountable obstacle. When Mr Zhang knew what happened to me,he held a private talk with me. He told me that I would  overcome difficulty if I could be patient and work hard. Moreover, he arranged  some students who had a good mastery of English to help me with my English.  Finally, I made a great progress in English study and could get high score in  English examinations.   Above all, Mr Zhang set a good example for me that everyone should be  Commited [fm1,-] to his work and care for others.    
<ST 4>  <band 6> <title CLASSIFICATION>  Factors Responsible for the Burgeoning Air Pollution Problem While air pollution is not a new phenomenon, it is now apparent that it is one of  our most rapidly growing environmental problems. There are three major  underlying factors, which serve to explain this condition.  The first factor is population growth. More people mean more manufactured goods  and services. [More people implies [vp3,-] that more goods and services are required.] This, in turn, lends to the second factor. The second one is expansion in industry and technology. The growth of industrial  activity, in the same period, has likewise been remarkable in terms of expansion [wd4,-] of existing plant capacity, and the increase in number of new manufacturing  establishments. The nature of the airborne wastes from some of these new  technology was completely unknown until adverse effects on man and his  environment suddenly became manifest. The third one is social changes. Two  important social changes including urbanization and the rising standard of living  occurred during this same period, and served to accelerate the trend of burgeoning  air pollution. Total [wd5,-] in a word, the combined impact of population growth, expansion in industry and technology and social changes operating in our contemporary society can be regarded as the compounding factors which have resulted in serious degradation of the urban air environment within relatively recent years. The Man I Admire Most   My father is the man whom I admire most in the world. As an ordinary  engineer, he has not much money or high position, but he is a man indeed  in my heart.   Father is the fifth child of my grandparent. Though the family was poor,  he didn't stop study [vp4,-] hard while many other children stopped in those days,  while doing much heavy work in the field. [sn7,-] He worked hard and became  excellence [wd2,-] in his study. When he was a grade three senior student, he did  so well that all the teachers thought he was doomed to go to the college.  Just then the "Chinese Cultural Revolution" broke out, which concealed the  entrance examination and dashed father's hope for college to the ground.  After several years of heavy labor work in the country, he heard the  information that the examination would resume soon when I have been  born [vp6,-]. As the only adult man in my family, he gave up this opportunity at last  due to the living pressure. He decided to support the family by farming, but  he also tried his best to find time reading and thinking. In 1980's, he passed  the exam for a machine plant and became a worker. He is conscientious  and has made a good job of designing mechanic equipments. After he had  served the enterprise about twenty years and when he was fifty-two, the  plant broke out. Being in depression for a short period, father decided to  establish a private firm instead of waiting for aftercare. Father is an honest and faithful person. He is warm-hearted to his friends  and workmates, and always ready to help them. Many people would still  remember he spent his spare time to help the new workers learning [vp5,-]  techniques without any charge. Father is strict with us children [wd5,-]. He always tells us: "Don't trust the fate,  but make efforts to control it! "  He also tells us that a knowing one without  good virtues means nothing at all because such a person lives only for his  own benefits and can't devote himself to the society. "What we try to give  you is how to be a righteous and useful person, while some other parents  try to leave lots of money for their children." Father said [vp6,-] to me and my  sister.  
<ST 4>  <band 6> <title Letter, e-mail and telephone> Letter, e-mail and telephone are the most three [wd1,-] wide [wd2,-] used ways for people in different places to communicate [vp1,-] each other. They share many abilities [wd3,-]. However, the characteristics of them are much different. Writing letters is the most traditional and formal way. Usually people can mail  some papers in words and/or pictures in a letter. Because letters are delivered by  post offices, it will take several days for a letter to reach its destination. Another  weakness of letters is that it is rather expensive especially for overseas ones. Sending e-mails to contact is the result of the developing of the digital  technology. Because e-mails are sent through Internet, Sending  e-mails is a very  fast, cheap and safe communication way. Thousands of e-mails can be delivered in  several minutes safely with very low cost. What is more, all digital medium,  including words, pictures and even sounds all can be sent by e-mails, and those  make e-mails much vivid and interesting. Because the great superiority of the  e-mail, it becomes the most popular communication way in the university students  now. Taking telephones is a real time way. The great strength of telephones is it is interactive, so people in different places can chatter through them. Visual  telephones even can help people see each other. The weakness of telephones is also  obvious. Only sound can be sent by this way. What is more, the cost of it is very  high. In my option, e-mail is the tread of the developing of communication way. It will be used widely in our daily life.  How to built [fm1,-] up Computer With the economic development in our country, more and more  Computer [np6,-] is [vp3,-] coming into usual family [np6,-]. In the so-called information technology society in the next decades, computer will become a necessary electronic equipment in daily life, just as television and refrigerator. As we buy a computer, we have two choices. One is to buy a total computer system, which  means in the computer company the computer has already been built up. In  this way, it is very convenient, but you loss [wd2,-] the opportunity to enjoy from [vp1,-] building up a computer and you may cost [wd3,-] more money sometimes. I suggest  you to build up your own computer. Now, I give you a hand about how to build  up a computer. In general, the four steps [np7,-] may be necessary. First, define [vp4,-] basic parameter of the computer, which depend [vp3,-] on what do  you do with your computer [sn8,-]. For example, if it is only applied on typing word and going into Internet, Pentium II is enough; if you want to process images frequently, perhaps Pentium III with 128M RAM is better. By the way, better specification means costing more money. Second, to select and buy every part of the computer. The hardware  includes monitor, keyboard, main board with CPU, modem, mouse, hard-disk  and its driver, CD-driver, soft-disk driver, RAM, sound box and its driver. The  software includes system software and applied software.  Third, to build up the hardware of the computer. It is very easy because  every part and its interface are standard. Your task is to put every element  together according to their relationship.  The last step, which is the most important and difficult step, is to load in  software and to test the whole system. Specialized knowledge is needed to test  the addresses of every port of the system, avoiding complicate [vp5,-] with each other.  Till now, a whole computer system has been built up. You can begin to do  what you want to do. If you have further questions , call +86-010-66668888,  please. You will get more help.         
<ST 4>  <band 6> <title A Close Friend of Me> 	He is a new friend of me. However he has given me a deep impression.  When I saw him on the first sight, his big eyes gave me [wd4,-] deep and nice  Impression [fm3,-] . As such a few [pr6,-] boys have that big eyes. I suppose maybe some little girls will fall in love with him on the first sight only because of his beautiful eyes.  What a pity that he just wears glasses, though it can not hide the charm of his eyes. 	He is somehow shy especially in front of strangers. He told me he was the  Chairman of the Graduate Students' Union of his department, so I doubt why he is  still so shy now. Perhaps it is one of his personality [np6,-] which he has formed [wd3,-] as a little boy. But he is active among his old friends and is liked by them. And though he is a little shy, he always likes to help others in need. He is a hardworking man. Even in the holidays or on the weekends, you can  find him in his lab, reading the foreign reference books or preparing the papers. I hardly leave out another main character of him ¨D¨D eating sock. When you  visit his dormitory, you will find there are all kinds of socks on the chair, desk and even his bed. And you can notice that he always eats the gams whether he is  working or relaxing. On this point, he has the character just like a little girl. And we give him a nice nickname as "sock king".  In a word, he is a man with a warm heart and nice personality. And I am so  happy to be one of his close friends.  
<ST 4>  <band 6> <title Cars> Considered the usage, Cars can be categorized into two kinds. The most familiar to us is those cars that used [vp7,-] for transportation. This kind of car is widely used in concern with [wd5,-] our private life and society. The private car taxi bus [sn6,-] is the most commonly used means for us to go to work. Ambulances take the injured or sick person rash [vp5,-] to hospital, lorries carry goods between cites and countries, provide [vp2,-] people convenience and necessities. [sn1,-] Without this kind of car people would live in a very helpless condition.  The other kind of car is used as special tools. They usually do not pertain to transportation. Such like shovel car, crane etc are used in building construction. Fire engines protect citizen's life and properties. People live in snowy region [sn7,-] are more depend [vp4,-] on the snow mobile. Farmers use the harvester to gather agricultural products efficiently. These cars are for special purpose [np6,-] and they finally facilitate our life. 
<ST 4>  <band 6> <title Computer> According to the scale and performance, computers can be classified as  huge-scaled computers, middle-scaled computers or personal computers. A huge-scaled computer is also called a massive parallel processor. In general,  it is composed of several dozens of central processing units with great processing  speed, huge capacity of memory and hard disk [np6,-]. It can provide good performance to satisfy the need of complicated transaction processing such as weather forecasting.  Of course, it is very expensive (usually more than $100,000). On the other hand, a  personal computer usually has only one common central processing unit, one or  several memory cards and hard disks. It can meet the requirement in our daily  works, and its price is usually about $1,000. A middle-scaled computer just stands  between the huge-scaled computer and personal computer in scale, performance  and price. It usually contains several central processing units, memory cards and  hard disks. It usually costs from $10,000 to $100,000. And it can be used in  enterprise business management.  
<ST 4>  <band 6> <title What Is Trust>        When you get a good friend help [vp5,-] you to do an important thing, you may  say you trust in him. That means that you are sure your friend will do his efforts to help you and can do the work well for you. When you have some confusion with  some words in your reading, you may look up the dictionary because you are sure  the dictionary is always right. That is, you trust in it. Trust is a popular word. Usually individuals talk about whether they believe  in someone or not, or whether they are confident with something or not. In fact,  they are talking about the meaning of trust. Trust means the assured reliance on  some person [np6,-] or something. That is also to say,  trust is a feeling that people have a confident dependence on the character, ability, strength or truth of someone or something. We make friends or pursue good qualities of things in our ordinary life. The purpose is that we can trust in them anytime in order to promote the quality of our life.  Professional sport may be classified as group sports and one-man sports, according  to the number of participators in the contest. Some sports need several person [np6,-] play [vp5,-]together on each side of the contest, while others are between two or many single person [np6,-].  Group sports need cooperation between all of the participators. In most occasions,  cooperation is more important than personal skill. Most ball sports are group sports,  such as football, basketball, baseball and vollyball [fm1,-]. But some ball sports are one-man sports, such as table tennis and badminton.  On the other hand, one-man sport's score often depends on one's own capability.  Most track and field sports and gym sports are one-man sports, such as sprint,  marathon, long jump and javelin throw. But there also some track and field sports  are group sports, [sn8,-] such as relay race.  Suggest you have a neighbor just live upstairs. [sn7,-] You had lived together for about three years. You meet him every day, but you never talk to each other [pr1,-]. Do you think there are some friendship between you and your neighbor? You must say no.  On the other hand, suggest [vp4,-] you were travelling in a train and suddenly got  a serious stomachache. Somebody beside you helped you friendly. He  found some medicine for you and got some water for you. After this, you  and him [pr4,-] become friends and keep writing to each other frequently. Though  you meet him only once and stay together [wd4,-] only several hours, there do exist [vp3,-] friendship between you and him. In fact, friendship has no relation with the time you stay together and the times you meet each other. To my opinion, friendship is some kind of faith, comprehension  and willing to help each other.   As a friend, he will help when you need help. Similarly, if he has any trouble, he  will like to tell you about it. That is, you will share happiness and woe. Certainly,  there are many kind [np6,-] of friends according to the friendship between them. It [pr2,-] may be divided into common friends, good friends and very good friends. If you think some one is your common friend, you will help him when it [pr1,-] is not too difficult. But if you think some one is your good friend, you will do you [pr4,-] best to help him in most occasion [np6,-]. Father [fm1,-], if you are very good friends, you will do every thing for him.

<ST 4>  <band 6> <title Type of speech>     As we all know, the same meaning can be described In [fm3,-] different words  according to different situations. Almost all examples of speech by most speakers  of English fall into three categories: "standard", "colloquial" and "slang".    In general, standard usage includes those words and expressions understood,  used, and accepted by a majority of the speakers of a language in formal situations;  colloquialisms, on the other hand, are familiar words and idioms that are  understand [vp4,-] by almost all of [wd4,-] speakers  of a language and used in informal speech or writing, almost all idiomatic expressions are colloquial language; [sn1,-] Slang, however, refers to words and expressions understood by a large number of speakers but not accepted as good, formal usage by the majority.    It is necessary to point out that colloquial and slang speech often passes [vp3,-] into standard speech, but both colloquial usage and slang are more common in speech  than in writing. Most speakers of English will, during [pp2,-] appropriate situations, select and use all three types of expressions.     Miss Yang, for me, is a new teacher, because I am a new student of hers. At first  sight, I had a good impression to [np2,-] her. She is not too tall, but has a special  personality. She is beautiful. I cannot tell you more about her in details, however, I would like to show my first impression as follows.    She gave us a strong confidence in learning how to write a beautiful essay [np1,-] . Her speech seems to be a little quick, but her expression is absolutely clear and  reasoning. This point may be obviously showed in the text book, which [wd4,-] written  by Miss Yang. The text book is not so thick, but its sketch is arranged compactly,  logically, in readability [sn2,-]. Beside the description of the text book, her teaching is active [vp6,-]. In addition, the classroom was full of light atmosphere, because of her smiling friendly, our feeling comfortable, without any extra pressure upon us [sn2,-].  Before attending her lesson, I felt nervous, because my English is not so good. [vp6,-] Now, it is reasonable to believe that I shall be able to improve my English quickly, under the help of Miss Yang, kindly [wd7,-].    She helped us to learn how to analyze an essay, how to compose an article from  practice. [sn1,-] Practice is the best teacher. However, how to practice is a problem. Miss Yang just helped us solve the problem. First, she asked us to read some paragraphs  with a few relevent [fm1,-] questions. Second, she helped us find out the answers. And then, she helped us appreciate the ideas and skills of the writings. Finally, she asked us to try to write an article, following the examples [sn7,-].     I am sure that we shall share the effects of Miss Yang's teaching methods by the  end of this term.

The last type is entertainment movie [np6,-]. Examples are the movies that are used to relax and enjoy [wd3,-] people by dancing, singing and humor talk show.  
<ST 4>  <band 6> <title Friendship>  Friendship is commonly defined as "feeling and behavior that exists between  friends". People often say true friendship is worth more than money. In fact,  friendship has a more extensively [wd2,-] meaning in the different time and place. First is the most popular friendship in our daily life. They have many friends  and can help each other. This friendship makes their life colorful and enjoyable. In general, they have different opinions and likes for life and society, but that [cj1,-] cannot influence their relationship. Of course, most of these friendships are cannot [vp9,-] suffer [vp4,-] by time and money. When they [pr1,-] separated for a long time, the friendships will become colorless. The other friendship is in the business. Mutual benefits are the base of this  kind of friendship. Sometimes, they even do not know where their friend live [vp3,-] in and how many people in their friend's family. As soon as their benefits disappeared,  their friendships are over. [vp6,-] The most expensive and desirable friendship existed between closest friends. [vp6,-]  This is the true meaning of friendship we admired [vp6,-]. It cannot be calculated by money. This is a great wealth [np5,-] for people in their life. They can help each other without expectation to be repaid for the future. Their friendships are not died off [vp7,-] with the passing of time. When you are in trouble at any time, they can always give you a kind hand. When you understand the truly [wd2,-] meaning of friendship, you will not to [vp9,-] be messed by it.

She is about 160 centimeters high  with a kindly appearance, especially with a pair of speaking [cc4,-] eyes. Thirty years passed by, she sets up good examples for her pupils with precept as well as practice. [sn1,-] During the spring holiday this year, some of her pupils working in Nanchang and I expressed thanks and congratulated her with respect on her birthday of sixty years old. She is tireless in teaching.  A few of pupils were not able to catch what she had  said in the class. She made use of her spare time to help them with their lessons on the [wd5,-] every weekend . She not only imparts knowledge, but also trains the character of her pupils.  She paid highly attentions to extracurricular activities. She taught us that we should  love our motherland and our people by organizing out-visiting, and learn from  others and mutual help. [sn2,-] She considers others more than herself. She often gives lectures regardless of  her illness or her son's illness. Nevertheless, once some [pr6,-] her pupil was absent of class, she always goes to see him. Her lecture is the most welcome with [aj2,-] our pupils for her diversify [wd2,-] teaching ways. She always devotes all her attention and emotion in classroom.

She is good at combining her rich experience in life with textbook content, and teaching a pupil according to what he is good at.  For her love to pupils and her contribution to education she was elected an  advanced worker or a model worker for many times, nevertheless, she remained the  same modesty as she was.

<ST 4>  <band 6> <title What Is Charm>      Can you remember something in kind-garden or primary school? I'm sure you  had liked one of your teachers. Why? The teacher was a marvelous storyteller. The  teacher was kind of you. The teacher could answer all of the questions. And so on [wd3,-] are all the reasons. Now we have grown up. We are for [wd5,-] in love with somebody. In other's  eyes your lover may be very ordinary. But he (or she) has the magic power  making you think he (she) is the mostly [ad2,-] lovely, the brightest, the best [sn1,-]. Why?  That lies in your sweethearts' charm in your eyes. Being a child we have [vp6,-] no conscious [wd2,-] to say the teacher was charming.  We just knew the teacher could satisfy us. We felt happy with him. So we  liked him. But to an adult charm is a popular word. Individuals often talk  about how they feel charm one person is [sn8,-]. So are some of the reasons. Then what is charm on earth? People describe it usually use [vp4,-]  "fascination" "wonderful" "very very [wd6,-] beautiful" "be of ability" etc. In fact in our life different things in different eyes have their unique charms. The general  definition seems to be expressing [vp5,-] like that. Charm is a kind of internal  disposition, it can meet one's needs, or remind of bright things and happy  days. [sn1,-]         
<ST 4>  <band 6> <title Letter and Email>  The [wd5,-] years ago people usually write [vp6,-] letters to get in touch with somebody. But now email is a popular way. When writing a letter, first take out a pen and a piece of paper. Then you can write something on the paper. As far as email is concerned, a computer and Internet software are necessary. If you haven't used it before, after open [vp4,-] the network, you can not write directly like [wd5,-] a letter. First apply for your email box from email service in network. The following step is similar to letter [vp4,-]. You just need type in your box.  After finishing your writing or typing, you can send it. Sending a letter is [wd4,-]  little more complex. Put the paper in an envelope, seal it, stick a stamp, and write  the address on it. At last put it in a post office box. Several days later the letter will arrive [vp1,-] the destination. While sending email is simper and much faster. You only need type the email address, then put the button "send". That is OK. After seconds the opposite side however it far [sn8,-] can receive it. People prefer email to letter not just because its speed. One letter only [ad1,-] can Send [vp7,-] to one person. While one email can send [vp7,-] to many people. The cost of letter is rising in contrast to [wd4,-] decreasing cost of email. So email becomes a fashion now.

<ST 4>  <band 6> <title Professional Sports>  To take part in sports is a good habit of enhancing our body [cc3,-].  There are many kinds of sports that we can choice [wd2,-].

[sn9,-]such as basketball, football, vollyball, tennies, runing, boxxing [fm1,-] ,shotting [fm1,-] etc.  Each kind is very intersting [fm1,-].

For the sports in the water , there are some others such as wimming [fm1,-], boating, diving etc. All kinds of these sports are going on in the pool, in the lake and in the sea. Of course if you fear water [cc3,-] you can not take them.     Which sports are there in the sky? Parachuting and sky-ballet may be the sports  we can choice [wd2,-] . But not everyone can do them unless you have had some  professional training.                 No matter how can you think I consider that all kinds of sports  reveal man's strength and braveness [cc3,-] that he challenges the nature and himself .I like the sports.

There are a lot of things that have their own charm, such as football, chess (and  other sports), beautiful scenery, lovely boys or girls.

When I sat at the back of the classroom to listen to the master's speech,  I found that sitting beside me was a small boy dressed almost in rags. He  had got a dusty face, [wd4,-] a head of messy hair. He kept behaving very strangely.  He didn't listen to the master; instead, he was busy drawing something, as  I think he was drawing, in his exercise book. But he would immediately  scratch on it, [sn9,-] tear it up after he had finished drawing [sn1,-]. I joked with him," Why are your hands so dirty?" Even though others laughed at him, he  didn't answer me; he didn't show any expression on his face, just scratch [vp4,-],  and scratch [vp4,-].   After class, he was left alone in his seat, I approached him,  before we could talk, another boy came up to and said to me  loudly," Mr. Zhao, he is a halfwit." [sn1,-] Every child present burst into  violent laughter, While he didn't even open his mouth, [sn9,-] he didn't cry, [sn9,-]  he didn't lift his eyes. [sn1,-] The silent answer to such personal insult  made me wonder what it was that made him such an odd boy.   I asked his teacher and knew more about him. He was an orphan, living  with his two retired grandparents. He was suffering from both poverty and  loneliness.   I decided to do something. When I taught them to sing an English song,  I would stand near to him to let him hear and follow me more easily. After  that class, I waited outside the classroom, and went back together with him.  I tried to talk with him, and finally asked," can I visit your home?" He  thought for a while and said," I am too shy to invite guests."   "Go back and talk to your grandparents, [sn9,-] tell me whether they agree or  not this afternoon, [sn1,-] O.K.?" He nodded.   He said all right that afternoon.   At 19:30, he came to pick me up right on time. I had a good talk with  his family members, and inspired him as possible as I could. During the  talk, I could feel that his grandparents were both looking forward to his  great future. And I felt that I was coming nearer and nearer to the real him  ever since.   On the last day of our staying there, we were talking freely in the 3rd  floor corridor. He came up to me, reached his hands into his pocket, took  out an orange and said," Here you are, I grew it in my field." And then, he  took out another two and handed to me," you can share with your friends."   Just then, I saw one of my friends talking with his pupils down in the  playground. I said to him," Why not throw one to him?" He picked up an  orange, [sn9,-] threw down. [sn1,-]   He was such a bad thrower that before the orange could reach that far, it  hit the ground heavily, split [vp5,-], and splashed [vp5,-]. He suddenly burst into laughter, so happily, so heartily, [sn1,-] that tears almost came to my eyes." He laughed, he laughed." I kept talking to myself.   The memory of other experiences there faded as time passed. But the  two oranges, the real, real, happy laughter I've ever heard did leave deep  impressions in my mind, whenever I recall them, they are as fresh as  happened yesterday. [sn1,-]    
<ST 4>  <band 6> <title A real friend of mine>   She was my classmate when I was in junior middle school. In my impression, she  was a pretty little girl who sat quietly behind me. But we were by no means friends  at that time because we had never talked with each other. That sounded incredible-  perhaps I was too shy a little boy [np9,-] then. Her family moved to Shanghai when we were in junior three. She gave me a small card before she left. I accepted it  indifferently and soon forgot about it.   One year later, I went to live in the same city with her. I didn't realize that until one day I happened to meet her in the street. Of course, both of us were very  surprised to see each other. Naturally, we had our first conversation, which lasted  only a few minutes. We even didn't ask about each other's address before we walked  back on our each own journey and lost touch again.   What really surprised me was the card I received [wd4,-] that year's Christmas. It was a cold winter day when I just went back from class. A large white envelope was lying quietly on my desk. My name was written in a graceful but strange handwriting [np5,-].  With surprise and puzzlement, I opened it and saw a small red card with her name  at the bottom- it was SHE who sent it. She said she had asked several people for my  address and finally got it. She wanted to let me know that she was so glad to have  such a friend as me in this city?-"a friend"? I knew I had forgotten all about her  since that meeting, taking for granted it was just a coincidence. But she hadn't, and she even managed to send the card, regarding me as one of her friends. Moved and  ashamed, I read her words times again, knowing what a fool I was. I never thought  I understood exactly what friendship meant to me. At that time, however, I realized  friendship could be like this- a card with the warmest wishes, which was making  the winter days soft and gentle.   The next morning, I put into the postbox a delicate card, with my apology and my  sincere wishes for her- a real friend of mine.

It is a Chinese memorial day--a time of sentimental remembrance of the forebears. Usually the entire family take the day to visit the resting place of the forebears of the family. First, they repair the place, which has been left alone for a year. Graves are swept, manicured, fresh flowers placed, and perhaps a few new bushes or trees are planted. [sn1,-] Offerings of meats, vegetables, wine, and often a complete dinner are arranged and placed in front of the tombs. Other offerings of paper money and other symbols of wealth are burned in the belief that it [pr1,-] will transform into real wealth for their  ancestors in the spiritual world. Then, members of the family will bow to express their respect and transmit their regards. Usually, the eldest begins this portion of the rite by reading a prayer, which is subsequently burned amidst the explosion of firecrackers. Thus, the spirits of the ancestors are soothed. Their devoted offsprings [np5,-] have not neglected or forgotten them.                                                                  
<ST 4>  <band 6> <title TRUST MUSTN'T BE TRAMPLED> After a spell of extremely hard work and preparation, the first simulative [fm2,-] National Entrance Examination was coming. As senior middle school students, we all put a great Emphasis [np5,-] on this test. Because if you did well this time, it meant a very good start of a series of cruel exams [cc4,-] and you would have psychological advantage [np6,-] in the final NEE. In the exam, I was assigned to sit beside Peter. He looked nervous and anxious. A glance at him put me also on the edge [wd7,-].  But I hold the rein of [np2,-] my mind tightly and finished the paper when there were still twenty minutes to go [wd3,-]. I checked it over twice and found no mistakes. A deep breath got me calm, and everything ended for me. I took [wd3,-] my time to look at the classmates around leisurely. Suddenly, a whistle came into my ears, it was Peter's voice, "The key to the last question, please." [sn1,-] I turned around and saw his eyes full of pleas. Just before the  examination, Peter had a long talk with me. He asked me to "help" him in the test and gave me his word that it would be a secret of us forever. There were no much time before the NEE, and I thought the best way to increase his marks was not to find his faults in the knowledge but to establish a solid self-confidence [np5,-]. Therefore, high marks were more necessary. So I agreed. Now, as he turned to me, I gave him what he wanted generously. My cheating skill was perfect and it succeeded. Everything seemingly went on well. Peter got his high marks after a week. No one knew the secret until two days after the results of the test were announced. I had an ominous hunch when someone told me that I was wanted by the dean. I went into the office worriedly. As expected, the dean had some doubts about Peter's marks. He asked me, of course, in some other indirect ways if I had "helped" him. "Tell me the truth, I trust you." he added in the end. I denied peremptorily. It was a secret, and I could not fail [wd3,-] Peter. "OK, I trust you." The dean said again and let me go. After a few minutes, Peter was called. I told him the reason of the summons in time and asked him not to let the secret out. "I trust you." I said. A long time  later, Peter came back. I knew what happened from the expression of his face, guilty [wd2,-]. I got angry. I trusted him but he trampled my trust. So there came my turn. When I entered the office for the second time, I saw a livid face. "I know all of your plot." went the storm. It was really a long scolding, but I didn't hear any word at all. I was just thinking trust mustn't be trampled and Peter made me too disappointed. As the dean was tired and stopped, I offered my excuse; though cheating was not suitable, I really wanted to help Peter. [sn1,-] "You misunderstand me, [wd4,-] the -whole thing. What made me angry was not your cheating in the exam but that I believed in you, -however, you made full use of it to cheat me." Suddenly, I had an entire idea of the dean's -feeling. I trusted Peter, and he abused my trust. But what I had done. [sn8,-] Everybody needed -feedback for trust.-Several years have passed, but this incident still haunts my mind [cc3,-]. Whenever I want to get -other people's trust.[sn9,-] I am always thinking whether I have the right to deserve it and whether I -will abuse it. Because trust mustn't be trampled.  
<ST 4>  <band 6> <title THE TALE OF CATCHING A CICADA> The story traces back to my naughty boyhood in the countryside, where my -brother, my cousin and I had our most wonderful period of our lifetime.-One day, while we three were rambling in the woods, my cousin happened to -find a cicada crawling on the bark of a poplar. Struck by its sheer blackness and -strange appearance, she couldn't help putting out her hand to touch it. "Ouch!" She -cried out and away flew the cicada, buzzing loudly as if laughing at us. We hurried -to her only to find a scratch on her delicate back of the hand, excoriated [sn3,-]. My -brother and I looked at each other silently. We found the same thing in the other's -eyes: It is time for us men to take some action for the young lady. A cicada should -be caught and punished for the evil his compatriot had done.-We had been told before by the elders that the best way to catch a cicada was -to search on the ground of the woods before dawn, because that was the time for a -larva [np2,-] cicada to slough off into an imago. In order to complete the mission -successfully, we made a fully [wd2,-] preparation and get [vp6,-] armed to teeth. We took -everything useful we could think of: a lampshade (to serve as a net), a shovel (to -smash up its underground palace), two pairs of leather gloves (to defend the attack -from its powerful pincers), string (to tie it up when it was caught), a bar of -chocolate (we thought it was the most delicious thing in the world then, so it could -be used as lure), incense and matches (which often made us coughing, could be -used to force it out, if the chocolate didn't work), and a barrel of water (for the -same purpose).  The moment finally came. We rose up early in the morning, fully equipped, and -set out for the woods. After a quick search, our aim was found drilling out from the -soil. We decided to wait until it turned into cicada. The poor little thing crawled -leisurely towards the nearby bushes (maybe this was the first time he saw the -outside world), not perceiving that two giant monsters [vp9,-] smiling wickedly at him, [sn9,-] not -knowing that the moment [wd4,-] he came to new life turned out to be his doom day [cc1,-]. He -finally crawled onto the branch of the bush, after about twenty minutes, a cicada -exuviated out of the shell. [sn1,-] It was green and its wings were not able to stretch yet. It -was so delicate that we took it home by two fingers, with its weak legs scratching -the hand comfortably itching.-We gave it to the previous victim, wondering what kind of vicious revenge she -would do to him. To our surprise, she happily accepted it as a pet. Again, we -silently looked at each other, shrugged off, and found the same thing in the other's -eyes: Never to guess a woman's heart, or you will be misled to the middle of -nowhere. To catch a cicada was thought to be difficult, but it turned out to be easy. -To fight for someone may be loft [wd2,-], but it turned out to be unnecessary. In the -tumultuary world, how many things there are [sn8,-] which [cj1,-] we have imagined to be right -and helpful finally proved [vp5,-] to be insignificant! I don't know, and I don't want to -think of it, for fear of losing the precious courage god gives us to face our life.    
<ST 4>  <band 6> <title Kid's adventure>     I was a very active and adventurous kid when young, nothing strange could -escape from my acute eyes and fervent [fm2,-] exploration. [sn1,-] Each time when I went back -home with the feeling of accomplishment for discovering a new tree or a fresh rock, -I would surely receive a delicious scolding [cc4,-] of my parents. But that didn't matter at -all ¨C a discovery meant a new place to play, [sn9,-] a wonderful way to make my girl -classmate to cry at me when she could not find the way to go back. [sn1,-]-There was a small cave behind my house, and it was so hidden that an expert like me -hadn't found it until the second year of my searching in the area. I was almost driven mad for [vp2,-] -excitement at that moment, but I still remained part of reasoning power, to enter the dark hole -directly and without any special equipment seemed a little dangerous and stupid, so I decided -to make a careful plan before the great exploration. [sn1,-]-Two days later, one of my mate and I stood in front of the profound cave [cc4,-]. Plenty of kerosene -and cotton was got without any difficulty, and our torch could be ignited [wd4,-] anytime. "Hi, you", I -said, "What are you waiting for! Get in, I must hold the torch. [sn1,-]" He stared at me for a while, and -took the first step in the unraveled [wd3,-] space. The cave seemed endless, with countless turnoffs. We -could only see the tough rock [cc4,-] no more than three meters away, and when I got the idea to sign [vp1,-]-on the cliff as guide, it proved to be useless. "You fool," my friend became a bit impatient, -maybe afraid. "Necessary to go on? We'd better get out of here." I gave a slight nod, the -motion must be ridiculous [sn9,-] reflected by the fire held in my shivering hand. [sn1,-] We turned back, but -the action [wd7,-] really meant nothing; the surrounding was all the same everywhere, and we didn't -know the direction at all. We began to talk [vp1,-] each other, from the last examination to our first -joke playing [vp5,-] on little girl. It became colder and colder, and the torch dimmer and dimmer, -everything indicated us that we were in great trouble. [sn1,-] I seemed to be more dauntless, cause [fm1,-] my -fellow had set the example quite long [wd4,-] when [cj1,-] I started to follow him to cry. At last, the torch died, -I could only feel his heavy breath and nothing else could be seen.-We were very lucky; after a few minutes, I found the way out. Of course, the scale of the -scolding [wd4,-] this time was especially enormous, but I didn't care, I just wanted to hold my mother -tightly and this made her quite confusing. [sn1,-]-Not long ago, I went back to the cave. Some lamps were equipped and I could see the -whole things clearly. The cave was actually small, with only one round path in it. I recognized -the exact place where our torch extinguished; the distance to the exit was no more than ten -meters, and we were just circling in it time after time.

It's on the first -day of the lunar year and most of Chinese people take it more serious than the New Year's day -of solar calendar. Everybody feels so happy because of the coming of the New Year, and with -various means of celebration, the joy [cc1,-] atmosphere is made so clear during the festival period. -Family reunion is for sure [ad2,-]. No matter where or how busy you are, you must go back to family -on those days if you are a Chinese. There will be a large dinner for the whole family on the -New Year's Eve, indicate [vp5,-] the happiness and reunion of the family. A lot of people go to -restaurant to take it in recent years, but the dinner itself as a ceremony never disappears. Don't -forget the fantastic cracker, though a little dangerous, [sn2,-] people, especially children still love it -very much, and some even go on with it in regardless of the ban in big cities. The celebrations -outside home are also multiform. From the early 80's, CCTV gave a large, splendid night party -on the New Year's Eve each year, and it gradually became a new tradition on the festival. And -of course, the merchants will feel in heaven during these days, how can a person, no matter rich -or poor, resist [vp3,-] the temptation of shopping in such a good season? [sn1,-] People go out to buy various -things to send to friends, relatives, or just enjoy themselves.

<ST 4>  <band 6> <title One Unforgettable Match> I am a member of the Student's Bridge Club, and last semester, I took part in several matches held in this university. Since I am a green hand, I learned a lot of skills in bridge playing in these matches. But one match, I think, means much more than teaching me how to play bridge well. It was one Sunday afternoon. The sun was shining brightly and it was very warm. My partner and I went to the New Hydraulic Building in this university. There were many players in the classroom, which made the classroom much warmer, even hot. Every one felt sleepy because we had just finished a match in the morning. -At two o'clock, the match began. As the match going on, I felt more and -more active, and the thought of sleeping went away. One hand, [sn2,-] when I picked up -my thirteen cards, they were: Spade A K J 10 9 8 3, Heart Q 4 3, Diamond K J 2, -and Club 6. I opened with one spade, and after several rounds of bidding, we -reached the final contract seven spade. I am the dealer. After my opponent led a -club, my partner showed his cards. I saw they were: Spade Q 8 7 2, Heart A K 9 2, -Diamond A 4 3, and Club A 2. It seemed not difficult to accomplish this slam. The -first idea occurred to me was that I should try the opportunity in diamond, that is to -say, if the diamond Queen was held by the one on my right hand, I could easily -make it. So after I winning the first trick, [sn3,-] I led the diamond 3 from my partner's -side and put on Jack myself. Unfortunately, the one on my left hand had diamond -Queen, and he won this trick. Thus I lost the contract. After that, my partner told -me that I should try the opportunity that the division of heart on opponent's side -was three to three. (If it was so, I could make the heart 9 win the thirteenth trick -and made the slam. And actually if I had done so, I would have won.) But the -attaching to the first thought made me miss it.-After that, I learned that in a bridge match, sometimes one should not trust -his first idea too much, and he should find the best way to make a contract. And it -is so with real life, isn't it?  Outline

Unlike other festivals, it lasts a period of [wd5,-] almost half a month, after beginning on New Year of Chinese lunar calendar. The Spring Festival has such a long festival [wd3,-] that we can even chase [wd3,-] it to more 4000 years ago.-It's a custom that Chinese people begin to attach Spring Festival couplets -and New Year paintings on doors and decorate windows with all kinds of paper cuts several days before Spring Festival. But now, this tradition can rarely been seen now [wd6,-].-Most people get a long holiday and go back home however far they are -from their hometown, for Spring Festival means family reunion for Chinese people.  Always, there is a big dinner to celebrate the reunion of family members on the last -day of a year, which is also regarded as the symbol of the arrival of Spring Festival. -People eat dumplings and New Year cakes in this festal atmosphere since their [wd2,-] -pronunciations of the two kinds of food mean good luck.-There are also many social activities in Spring Festival. In ancient times, -people used to go out to attend all kinds of gatherings, and appreciate beautiful -lanterns while trying to work out the riddles written on them. Now, the situation is -different, [sn9,-] people seem to have grow out of this tradition, and prefer going shopping -or just entertaining themselves at home. [sn1,-] Unlike lantern riddles, crackers, [sn9,-] which are -requisite in Spring Festival, are still very popular among people, especially among -children. People like setting off crackers not only because it creates a jovial -atmosphere but also because it [wd6,-] means promotion, and they believe that setting off -crackers can bring themselves and their family a fortunate year. In the period of -Spring Festival, people spend much time in visiting relatives and friends to offer -New Year greetings [cc3,-], and recent years it is very popular to make a phone call to -offer greetings [cc3,-]at the very moment that [cj1,-] the New Year begins.-There are several special things in Spring Festival, one being New Year -card.

There was little sound except the slight snoring from those clerks who already dosed [fm1,-] off. I dragged my feet to the corner to make myself a cup of coffee. I needed it to drive away my own drowsiness. Back in my section, having had a sip of coffee, I reached down to the coffer to get some confidential files I was assigned to check. I remembered the code clearly. It was " [sn9,-] the date on which I acquired this dead-end job. But to my surprise, the coffer just refused to open. I tried again. Still no way, 'There must be something wrong'. I said to myself, looking up at the clock on the desk, [sn9,-] which read three-twenty. I knew I couldn't wait. If I did not finish the report on those files today, I would lose the job. I phoned Mr Johnson, a locksmith who had just started his business. Actually, he just got out of prison. He was sentenced to [pp1,-] ten years behind the bar for a serial burglary. He said he would be glad to help and came to my office in roughly twenty minutes.I told him the trouble as the other clerks are leaving the office for the tea break. He took out his tools and got ready to open the coffer. I asked him how I should pay him.'Well', the five-feet six locksmith looked up at me and said ' I'm not sure. But the last time I opened a safer, I got $50,000.'We all laughed as suddenly he took out a pistol and pointed it at me.It was hard to imagine what happened. He opened a coffer, but not the one I wanted him to open.

I rode on my bike in hence [wd7,-] because I had a compulsory course right away.  The sunshine was pleasant and -I noticed there were many new posts along the main road. I appreciated the colorful designs [sn9,-] while without glasses, I could not read the contents. But judging from the situation, I thought there would be some exciting activities recently. On stepping into the classroom I noticed most of the boys in our class had arrived but chosen the seats at the back. How strange! Usually they run in at the last moment.  With wondering about this, I walked slowly to find a suitable seat. A girl classmate called me with a smile,' Hey, come here!' Great! I ran over and took off the bag. Just then a boy came over, with a red rose and a card sent before me, 'Happy the festival!' I was so surprised that couldn't help staring at him. [sn8,-] 'It is -girls' day today!'  I had forgotten it completely so you can imagine my expression at that time.  All the boys laughed. Perhaps the more surprise from girls, the more happiness of the boys.  After reading the card, I was even moved and said to my neighborhood, 'We had better do something for these lovely boys in return. For example, we can date a certain day as boys' day of our class.' She thought for a while and laughed,' How about April 1st? Then we can send tricks -back as presents without being punished!'  It was really a good start of the day. Even the boring lesson seemed acceptable. Time passed -quickly before I knew it. After the class, I found the campus a sea of flowers.  Outside the 7th dining-hall there was a desk packed with red roses prepared for the boys presenting [vp2,-]their  girlfriends. Besides there were also some interesting toys for free.  It was impossible to leave  with nothing back! On May 8th the girls seemed the most beautiful. And because 'you are blessed so I am happy',  the boys who organized the whole affairs got a sense of achievement and satisfaction. I think it  doesn't matter whether girls' day or boys' day. The most important is that we find out our own way  to enjoy both ourselves and lives.                                                                 
<ST 4>  <band 6> <title IT'S  WORTH  DOING>   It was August already, but the weather of the grassland was still very cool. My parents and I,  with some other people, walked along the path in the grass, appreciating the beautiful setting sun,  when the huge balloon floating in the air seized our sight [cc3,-].    Walking nearer, we could see that it was a kind of entertainment. A tourist paid the money and  then he can sit [vp6,-] in the chair beneath the balloon, and be lifted up into the sky for some time. The  idea of floating in the air and facing the great green ground [cc3,-] took all my heart. I wanted to have a  try, but I must wait, for there were still several people before me.    Wait, wait, [sn6,-] the big monster up and down. [sn1,-] Suddenly, the weather changed. There came a  ferocious wind and the sky got darker. The man in charge of the balloon said,?° That's all for  today." What? But I must go back home the next day! I was so worried, unwilling to miss this  chance, [sn1,-] but how?- [sn9,-] I turned to Father. He looked at the sky, then looked at me. [sn1,-]  "You really want to  do that, don't you?" Father asked me in a very gentle voice. I nodded. He thought for a few  seconds, then said to the balloon-charger, [sn1,-]?° Sir, just one more time, OK? We'll be back home  tomorrow." "But you know that'll be very dangerous!" The man shouted. "Yes, I know. But you  see, we can finish it before the wind does any harm." Father said firmly, [sn1,-] then we all looked at the  charger, eyes full of pleas [sn2,-]. "So, OK, [sn1,-] come on, but be quick!" The man finally agreed. I  immediately ran over to him.    They had expected to raise me little by little, but the wind was too hard. The balloon was blown  to a certain direction and [vp9,-] rising sharply at the same time. I just heard the air whistling past my  body and the whole grassland came into view. The world was quiet and magic. I stretched my  arms, enjoying the cool feeling of air running through my fingers and the golden red gleaming of  the setting sun. This is a completely fresh space for me.    Then and there, I looked down to find the people under me were turbulent. They held the belt  which tied the balloon to the ground and wanted to pull me back. But I [pr1,-] seemed out of control.  They spent all the strength but the balloon just slid side to side at [wd4,-] an altitude and the people were  dragged side to side, too. Some passers-by joined them. I could hear the noise from under. The  strong wind played [wd3,-] me just as played [wd3,-] a fallen leaf.  A long time passed. In the end, my feet touched the ground again. I ran to my parents. Looking  at me, Father said, "I'm afraid now. I should have been afraid before that. You may don't know  just now how nervous we were. We thought that if the tie was not tough enough we will [vp6,-] lose you."  "Yes, that is. But Pa, you don't know what I saw above was so wonderful that I'll [vp6,-] never forget it."  "That's good enough," Father smiled, "You had a hazardous trip while you think it's worth  doing that, [sn6,-] then all is right. [sn1,-]"              
<ST 4>  <band 6> <title The Way to the Children's Palace> When I was seven, I used to learn dancing in the Children's Palace. The training program was from 3.00 till 6.00 in the afternoon. It was a windy and rainy summer afternoon. At 2.30, I started [vp2,-] my way to the Children's  Palace after one day's study at school. I should have taken a certain bus, got off after three stops,  and changed to another bus for five stops. If I have had done all these right, it would have taken  me about half an hour to get to the program. Yet somehow, I got lost that afternoon. Maybe it was because the wind and the rain had  distracted my attention, [sn1,-] maybe I was in such a hurry that I forgot to keep counting the stops, or  maybe, it was just natural for a child to get lost. Fortunately, after circling the same block for several times, [sn3,-] it suddenly occurred to me that I  had possibly been to that place before. With the help of my blurry [fm2,-] memory, I finally found the way  back home. Grandpa was at home then. He was very surprised at seeing me soaking wet.  "Didn't you take your umbrella with you?" Grandpa asked. "Yes," I murmured, "but I forgot to open it." Grandpa quickly took out a towel and began drying my hair while I felt a tempting smell from  the kitchen. I suddenly got hungry, [sn6,-] very hungry indeed. "Mm, let me have some comforting  refreshment." I said to myself. Grandpa began to chat with me when I was busy enjoying the food. "So, your program ended a lot earlier this time. It's only five o'clock now." "No, I lost my way when going to the Children's Palace. I spent much time finding the way  back. Anyway, I succeeded at last." With pride I told grandpa my adventurous story. Grandpa became quiet.  When we arrived at the Children's Palace that afternoon, it was nearly 5.30. The instructor there  was surprised to see me, "I thought you wouldn't come today. It's so late now, and the weather is  bad." Grandpa smiled at me. And with pride again, I knew what he meant. Yes, even to this day, I can clearly recall grandpa's words on the way to the Children's Palace.  "If you have chosen something, you can never give it up easily. Remember, persistence is always  of most importance on your way to success." A Traditional Chinese Holiday

Special and splendid TV shows  The Spring Festival is one of the most important holidays in China. Generally speaking, it is  on January 1st in lunar year; yet sometimes, it also means the whole period of time from December  23rd till January 15th  (the Lantern Festival) in lunar year. The holiday is so called because it is the  beginning of a new spring, [sn9,-] and a new year. On the night before the Spring Festival, the whole  family gathers together and has a grand delicious dinner, [sn9,-] among which the dumplings (called Jiao  Zi) are usually necessary. During the holiday, people are busy visiting relatives and friends,  sending New Year wishes to each other, giving money or some other gifts to children. [sn1,-] The Spring  Festival scrolls [wd3,-] appearing on the doors of many families make a warm and happy atmosphere, as if  they were [vp6,-] telling people the spring is coming. At night, the sky is lightened by various kinds of  fireworks. The celebrations are not limited within the family; the whole society whoops it [pr1,-] up.  Temples have special activities, such as the New Year tolls at midnight. Hearing the blessing tolls  on the Spring Festival is said to ensure good luck in the new year. TV stations also make  enormous efforts. Movies, TV series and other special programs abound; watching CCTV's  annual party on Spring Festival Eve has become a new tradition for most Chinese.

<ST 4>  <band 6> <title A Party With High School Classmates>      In a bright winter evening, the soft moonlight was shining on me. I was going to attend a  party for the returning of two high school classmates from Singapore. I rode my prized bike with a [np7,-]  unusual high speed. When I reached [wd3,-], almost all my high school classmates had come. They were all inquiring of  the two [vp2,-] the experiences in Singapore. It seemed that they had gained many experiences there.  They learned not only the knowledge in books, but also some practical skills. Such as, they  learned haircut [cc3,-] because to have a haircut there would cost about 20RMB; they did part-time job [np6,-] so  as to live better. Their every courses [np3,-] were [vp3,-] much practical than ours. In the end of every semester,  they should did oral presentation. I had never did [vp6,-] any test like that, it was an absolute new thing to  me. [sn1,-] "we really learned something abroad", they said. Other classmates in Tsinghua or Peking University also shared their experience [np6,-] with all of us.  A classmate in Electric Engineering Department of Tsinghua University told us that he learned a  number of difficult specialized courses, and he got high marks. His average mark were 95. So he  won the first-class Scholarship of the Electric Engineering Department. It was amazing, although I  knew that him was a genius. Reflecting on my marks of average 85, I felt I should work much  harder the next semester. When my best friend told me that he were learning French that [pr1,-] semester, I was surprised.  Although I had ever planned to learn a second foreign language, but I didn't learn any for two  semesters. In comparison with him, I wasted a lot of time. A classmate were [vp3,-] elected to be the Student Union's chairman of Psychology Department of  Peking University. He really gained his position [cc3,-] in his department. It [pr2,-] showed his ability in  organizing.  The best singer of our original class declared that she entered [wd3,-] the top ten singers of Peking  University. In high school, she only won the second among tens of singers. But then she won the  top ten among thousands of singers. We all congratulated her for her success. She did what she  didn't finish [wd3,-] in high school. She was a successor. What did I did [vp6,-] that semester? I thought hard. I only established a web site in the internet; I  only wrote a little software; I only finished my specialized courses and won a third-class  scholarship of my department. I didn't make much progress in studying; I didn't attend many  activities; I didn't gain any position [cc3,-] in my department. When I shared my experiences with others,  I was afraid to be laughed. But to my surprise, after my statements, they all attracted by my web  site. They all considered it a wonderful thing, and they desired to visit it. I felt much better then. A  classmate in Computer Science Department of Peking University was envious of my software. "It  should have strong determination to write a software [cc3,-]", she said. I felt glad then. I never thought of  it.  May be it is truth [np6,-]: what you did and you [wd6,-] despise [vp6,-], [sn9,-] may attract others.

Telephoning the family members that cannot go home  Being a traditional Chinese festival of special significance, the mid-autumn  festival is celebrated all over the country in the evening of 15 August in the  Chinese Lunar Calendar, the middle of the autumn; [sn9,-] and [fm3,-] the festival is  therefore named. However, the importance of the festival lies in another name  of it, a more beautiful and romantic one¨C the moon festival. Why is that, [sn9,-] you [fm3,-]  may ask. Firstly, it's because at the night of the festival, the moon goes  rounder, bigger and brighter than any other night of the year. Secondly, in  China, people see the full moon as a symbol of family reunion, so the festival  becomes a day of family reunion. On that day, people tried [vp6,-] their best to go  home and reunite with other family members, especially those that [cj1,-] don't meet  the family often. People have various ways to celebrate the mid-autumn  festival. Traditionally, the whole family sits in the open air, drinking tea and  sweat Osmanthus wine, eating mooncakes and fresh fruit, and enjoying the  brightest moonlight of the year. The kindly old [cc6,-] Grammy would tell the old  myths and stories about the moon. But nowadays, people find other ways to  celebrate the festival. Such as holding family reunion parties, watching special  TV programs designed for the festival, and sometimes telephoning the family  members whom are not able to go back home. [sn2,-]

Evening show by CCTV   Spring Festival When we talk about festivals, Spring Festival will come first. It [pr2,-] is not only because it comes on  the first day of the lunar New Year, but also it has great significance for Chinese all over the world.  Maybe it is as important as the Christmas Day in western countries. We Chinese regard spring as the beginning of a new year. At the beginning of the new year, we  always have great wishes for the coming year. So celebrations for [np1,-] the Spring Festival in China  also mean that. You can see that from the greetings at that time ¨C [sn9,-] all of them are best wishes for  the new year's fortune and health. With the development of the society, many new customs have  joined the old ones. Both of them have made up of [vp2,-] the celebrations of the Spring Festival. Go down town on Spring Festival, [sn3,-] you may find some Temple Fairs. Because in the old days,  there were always some fairs around temple [np6,-], the name of  "Temple Fair" continued. [sn1,-] In the  countryside, there are also some small fairs a few days before the Spring Festival. There you can  find dragon-lantern play [np6,-] and stilt [np6,-], etc. People play in great din of gongs and drums, expressing the  joyance [fm2,-] and wishes for another harvest year. When the night curtain falls down, firecrackers and  fireworks display became [vp6,-] the theme everywhere. Colorful fires with resounding crack. [sn2,-] You may  feel deaf after hearing that, but that won't diminish your happiness [cc3,-]. But to the concerns of  pollution and public health, governments in big cities began [vp6,-] to control the fireworks .So cassettes  of firecrackers' sound became [vp6,-] popular in some big cities. Paying a new year call is also essential  to Chinese. You can find people busy shuttling from place to place to send their best wishes.  Telephone, mobile phones, beepers and email release people [cc3,-] a lot. They can enjoy [vp2,-] themselves   saying  "Happy Spring Festival" to friends and folks without hustle. For those who work and study far away from their hometowns, Spring Festival means more.  Then a big family get-together is always on the Spring Festival's Eve. All the members sit around  the [np7,-] table to share the delicious Nianyefan (New Year's Eve Dinner). And dumplings are essential  to everyone. In my hometown ¨C Shandong ¨Cdumplings have various tastes, you may find a coin in  one dumpling if you are lucky enough. [sn1,-] After that nearly all of us will stay up in front of the TV to  watch the evening by CCTV and wait for the coming of a new year. With the development of the society, Spring Festival has changed a lot. But one thing will not  change that the Chinese people's best wishes for the peace and happiness! [sn7,-] Is there any girl in the world who doesn't want an elder brother?    Is there any girl in the world who doesn't want an elder brother?    Well, at least I've never seen any girl saying so. On the contrary, for all these years I've been  growing up with girls fancying having [vp5,-] an elder brother, [sn1,-] imagining him as tall and handsome, cool  to the other girls but kind to the topmost level when facing her [sn2,-]. He would do her homework, play  with her when it is boring, comfort her when she is frustrated, and buy her unexpected but  fantastic gifts now and then.    Well, I must admit that I do have a brother, tall, handsome, and smart. That's what makes me  the most envied one among all the girls in the neighborhood since primary school years.  It [pr2,-]'s not  that [cj1,-] my brother has so much glamour that my fellow girls like him even to the point of hating me,  but that [cj1,-] having a brother is something really [ad1,-] not bad. I can guess from their attitudes they must be  jealous of me though they do not say so.     You must be thinking that I am quite proud of it. But to tell you the truth, [sn2,-] if any girl had  expressed her longing for a brother in my face at that time, I would at once "transmit" my brother  to her, without any reluctance. What? You said I'm too cruel? You don't understand what a devil  my brother was when we were small [wd3,-].    In the summer when I was three and my brother was just over eight, my mother took us for a  walk in the evening. She put me in a baby wheelchair, and asked my brother to care for his little  sister. My brother, out of his interest in the wheelchair, played with it at his will. He swung it from  side to side swiftly, and back and forth, taking no notice of his scared-to-death little sister in the  hell-like wheelchair. Maybe he felt it still not stimulating enough, or he wanted to test the hardness  and the stability of the wheedle, whatever, [sn1,-] he dropped hold of it suddenly and let it slid down the  street, [sn9,-] where cars passed like wind constantly. God must be watching me at that time, for no car  hit me or I won't [vp6,-] be able to sit here and tell this story to you. But my wheelchair hit the edge of  the pedestrian's walk along the street, and this accident left a scar on the left side of my face. The  psychological effect of this terrible accident is so severe that for a considerably long time since  then, I screamed whenever my brother tried to talk to me. As my brother explained to me later, every boy wants [vp6,-] to have a little brother, so they can play  fighting games together, but a sister [sn2,-]! He shrugged at the thought of it. Little girls were all fussy, [sn9,-]  and troublesome. He just wanted someone to play with, but there came someone who needed to be  taken care of all the time! Every time when he tried to explain the accident in this way, I would  retort that there was no silly girl who ever wants [vp6,-] a brother, especially an elder one [sn2,-], boring and  cruel [sn2,-]. Instead, an elder sister would be fantastic: you can wear her clothes, confide your secrets to  her and get millions of marvelous gifts from her. [sn9,-] An elder sister? [sn9,-] My brother laughed, [sn9,-] Oh, only  silly girls like you want elder sisters to order you doing [vp5,-] errand [np6,-] [cc3,-] around. [sn9,-]  So, you see, my brother and I had tremendous difficulty in communicating, [sn1,-] I guessed that is  because our minds are made of different materials at born [pp2,-]. Wait, [sn2,-] maybe we are not brother and  sister indeed, hmm, that may well explain why we don't coordinate. [sn1,-] I began to imagine him being  discarded by his original parents, on a deserted street in a cold winter night, [sn2,-] when my parents  passed and out of sympathy for him, [sn9,-] took him home and have [vp6,-] been treating him just as their own  son since then. [sn2,-] Ah, I should tell him the truth, anyhow he's old enough now, he has the right to  know his own destiny. [sn1,-] I said to myself complacently when suddenly thunder-like sounds burst  from outside the room and I knew it's devil [np6,-] knocking on the door. "I won't open the door for you,  come in and watch TV if you are so apt. [sn1,-]" There was a period of quietness, and I suddenly saw  slips of paper came [vp5,-] in from under the door. I jumped up and screamed, for it was my favorite  storybook. I opened the door and there stood him, with a triumphant air on him face, "I win, [sn9,-]  again." That was really what happened in our childhood, [sn1,-] I just can't imagine how, in some families,  brothers and sisters live together happily or at least, without fight, tears, peace negotiation,  compromise and treason time and time again, [sn2,-] which, in my eyes, are all indispensable children  experiences in their growing process. [sn2,-] I always complained to my parents of my brother's  malicious nature and ruthless deed [np6,-] when we were small [wd3,-], but it is the same person who boasts  everyday to her roommates of her great and thoughtful brother now. I can't tell when and how this  change happened, but we did begin to be proud of each other. I used to point to the name list of  excellent students in the display window of our secondary school, and declared to my friends,  "This is my brother, he's now in Tsinghua! [sn1,-]", and I heard my brother bragging proudly to his  classmates, [sn2,-] "My sister's got another English prize, [sn1,-] she's top student in this school and she leaves  no room for me to stand on!" But we still fight at home, over trivial things such as whose turn it  was to wash the dishes, or which TV channel to watch. It seems that we have got accustomed to  this way of expressing that we are brother and sister, we are familiar with and fond of each other. [sn1,-]  Contradictory? No, you would never understand this kind of unsaid affection if you were not  lucky enough to have a brother. As I look back, I am wondering that it seems we have grown up in just one night. Now I am  in the prominent university that he has just graduated from, and he is now in America pursuing his  graduate study. Every time he came back, he would bring me millions of marvelous gifts, and we  would talk nonsense, just as before. I like to talk nonsense with him, it [pr2,-] makes us feel close to each  other. [sn1,-] But, as he pointed out in a birthday card for me last year, this kind of chance would be fewer  and fewer. He wrote, "You are already 19 years old, and after another 19 years, our lives might be  well established, but I am always fearing that we would be more and more apart unavoidably as  time goes by." At the sight of these lines, I just couldn't help my tears from dropping. One weekend, when we were tidying [vp2,-] the house, I found two sheets of thin paper in an iron  box. As I soon made out, they were the birth certificates of my brother's and mine! On them were  my mother's name, the exact time of birth, the weights of the newly-borns, and the signatures of  the doctor and the nurses in charge. I found out that we were brought to earth by the same doctor!  Well, I must admit, after a long game of kidding, that he is my brother. I knew it, because the  blood relationship is there. Is there any girl in the world who doesn't want a brother? I don't believe anyone can be that silly.  Is there any girl in the world who doesn't want an elder brother?    Is there any girl in the world who doesn't want an elder brother?    Well, at least I've never seen any girl saying so. On the contrary, for all these years I've been  growing up with girls fancying having an elder brother, imagining him as tall and handsome, cool  to the other girls but kind to the topmost level when facing her.

I always complained to my parents of my brother's  malicious nature and ruthless deed when we were small, but it is the same person who boasts  everyday to her roommates of her great and thoughtful brother now. I can't tell when and how this  change happened, but we did begin to be proud of each other. I used to point to the name list of  excellent students in the display window of our secondary school, and declared to my friends,  "This is my brother, he's now in Tsinghua!", and I heard my brother bragging proudly to his  classmates, "My sister's got another English prize, she's top student in this school and she leaves  no room for me to stand on!" But we still fight at home, over trivial things such as whose turn it  was to wash the dishes, or which TV channel to watch. It seems that we have got accustomed to  this way of expressing that we are brother and sister, we are familiar with and fond of each other.  Contradictory? No, you would never understand this kind of unsaid affection if you were not  lucky enough to have a brother. As I look back, I am wondering that it seems we have grown up in just one night. Now I am  in the prominent university that he has just graduated from, and he is now in America pursuing his  graduate study. Every time he came back, he would bring me millions of marvelous gifts, and we  would talk nonsense, just as before. I like to talk nonsense with him, it makes us feel close to each  other. But, as he pointed out in a birthday card for me last year, this kind of chance would be fewer  and fewer. He wrote, "You are already 19 years old, and after another 19 years, our lives might be  well established, but I am always fearing that we would be more and more apart unavoidably as  time goes by." At the sight of these lines, I just couldn't help my tears from dropping. One weekend, when we were tidying the house, I found two sheets of thin paper in an iron  box. As I soon made out, they were the birth certificates of my brother's and mine! On them were  my mother's name, the exact time of birth, the weights of the newly-borns, and the signatures of  the doctor and the nurses in charge. I found out that we were brought to earth by the same doctor!  Well, I must admit, after a long game of kidding, that he is my brother. I knew it, because the  blood relationship is there. Is there any girl in the world who doesn't want a brother? I don't believe anyone can be that silly.  It tastes good Forrest Gump's mother said that life was like a box of chocolate. And I think many kinds of  experiences are just like a lot of styles of chocolate with different flavours and tastes. If it is the  first time we eat that kind of chocolates, we can never successfully expect how it tastes. Is it a  sweet milk chocolate or a slightly bitter black chocolate? Is it mixed with peanut or strawberry?   Is it a fresh one or an expired one? All these questions cannot be answered correctly until we have  put one into our mouth. The condition is the same when we experience something new, [sn9,-] No matter  how well we are prepared, we always run into something unexpectedly.   Raising fund for an activity sounded challenging and interesting. Although I was a layman to  that task, I took it over. I ever heard that "be prepared, or you won't make it", so I spent half a  week in making all kinds of preparations. As I thought making a telephone call was more polite   than visiting the office, I found a telephone book and transcribed dozens of telephone numbers  without noticing that the telephone book was published three years ago. Then the next thing to do  was to choose a lucky day to call them. It was a clear day. And my roommates had gone to the classroom. After a big breakfast [cc4,-] that I  thought could increase my confidence, I sat beside the phone, drew a deep breath, and made sure  that I was clear-minded. As I know [vp6,-] it was a very tough work, I, first of all, thought carefully about  the subject and what question I could expected and most convincing way [np6,-] to answer them. I even  wrote some key points on a yellow pad. Unexpectedly, that most deliberate preparation I had ever  made rendered nervous [wd7,-]. Realizing that I had wasted a lot of time in thinking the too detailed  problems and [wd4,-] getting my nerve more and more tense, I had to start my work. I could not remember  how I picked up the telephone, pressed the button [sn1,-]. When the unacquainted voice came from the  other side of the phone, I suddenly revived and spat out the entire subject as quickly as I could. To  my shock, the answer from the other side was "sorry, I think you've dialed the wrong number", [sn9,-]  "no this is not the Shell Company". Thinking that failure is the mother of success I made the  second one, [wd4,-] the third one. After being refused for several times I found I had wasted a lot of time  in explaining enthusiastically to an operator of the switchboard and given up easily when hearing  the manager's cold words. Gradually I learned how to illustrate briefly to the operator and how to  talk to the department manager to bring him or her around. However, the whole thing was far  more complicated than I had anticipated. All the bright managers required a fax about the activity  and the budget.   That challenging task suddenly turned into a routine one. I had to write and print the letter,  being obsessed with the title, the tone and the pattern. I felt I turned from an annoying sales dealer  into a patient secretary. Just as an old saying said " nothing is impossible to the effort and courage", our activity got  the biggest certified public accountants' assistant. I made an appointment with the manager to  acquire the donation. Unfortunately it was a rainy and windy day. As credit was the most  important thing, nothing can prevent me from going there. On my way to the office, the rain got  heavier and heavier, moreover the wind destroyed my umbrella. When I stepped into the hall of  the World Trade Center, I was soaked through and like a drenched chicken. The waiter looked at  me pointedly. As I didn't like to be questioned and drove away. [sn2,-] I step forward and asked where is  the CPAs office. He was quite shocked and pointed at the elevator and said "on the eleventh  floor". Through all these unexpected difficulties I got the donation for the activity, and successfully  accomplished the task. That new experience was just like a new style of chocolate to me. It gave me surprise,  achievement and excitement. Nothing can prevent me from taste [vp4,-] it.

Eating "Zong Zi" The dragon boat festival is one of the famous traditional Chinese ceremonies. Celebrated on [wd4,-], it is  in commemoration of the great patriotic poet Qu Yuan. He was always in great concern of his  country even in exile. When hearing of [wd2,-] the capital of his motherland had been conquered, he  committed suicide by jumping into the river. In the festival, people compete in the dragon-boat  race. It is said that Qu Yuan is not dead, so people are trying to save him from the river. "Zong Zi"  is the favorite food enjoyed in the festival. It is a pyramid-shaped dumpling made of glutinous rice  wrapped in bamboo or reed leaves. People believe those leaves can protect the sacrificial offerings  from the flood dragon.

How to make dumpling? Dumpling is a Chinese traditional food which is famous for its delicacy.  Maybe you think it is difficult to make, but in fact it is quite easy if you make it according to the following sentences. 	First, you must believe that making dumpling is not hard but joyful.  Since most Chinese can do it well, you can do it well too. It [pr3,-] doesn't need  any special technical but the only thing needed is the belief that you  can do it well. Once you have this belief, you will make delicious dumpling  easily. Then, the next step is preparing [vp5,-] the materials. You need such things: soy,  salt , vegetables, mince meat, water, flour and tools: [sn9,-] a roller, a kitchen  knife, [wd4,-] a small scoop. Isn't it [pr2,-] simple? Making dumpling doesn't need any uncommon  materials. Third, you should make the filling. It [pr2,-] is very important because it decides  the dumpling's taste. But don't worry anyway, [sn9,-] if you know how to cook a  dish, then you will find it is rather easy. [sn1,-] Just blend the vegetables which have been cut into pieces with the mince meat, and cut them into stuffing, then  add some salt and soy according your own favour. Thus the stuffing is done. The forth step is making [vp5,-] the wrapper. Maybe this step is most difficult [aj3,-].  After mixing the water and the flour and kneading it into dough, you should  cut the dough into small dough which is as big as a one-fourth ping-pang  ball. Then you can press the small dough into wrapper using a roller, which  is rather difficult. You can work in this way: one hand rolls the roller  as the other one sends the dough and rotates it at the same time. Since  you are a beginner, you should do this slowly and  be patient. When you  are familiar with it, you will find it is only a little dish. The last step is to fill the wrapper with the stuffing. This is very easy.  After doing that ,you can cook the dumpling. Then the delicious dumpling  is finished and you can taste it.   

<ST 4>  <band 6> <title How to Make Dumpling> Dumpling is maybe the most famous traditional Chinese food in the world,  here we will learn  to make it. [sn1,-] The process of making dumpling consists of three main steps: preparing  raw materials (the  sheet and filling), wrapping the filling with the sheet, and cooking it. The preparing step is the most complex one. The material of filling is  up to your taste.  Usually it includes meat, vegetables, and flavorings like salt, soy, etc.  Cut them up and mix round  them in a deep container, and then we can leave it aside and begin with  the sheet. To make sheet, [sn2,-]  first mix round flour and water in certain proportion to make it a stretchy  solid state, and split it  into small pieces, then role them into round shaped sheets with a rolling  pole. Thus the sheet and  filling are ready and we can wrap filling with sheet. Fit one sheet with  about one teaspoon of  filling putted in the center of it [pr1,-], then carefully enclose the sheet. Put  these uncooked dumplings in  a big basin to dry them, then put them into boiled water to steam for about  15 minutes until the  water boil again and the dumplings are all float [vp4,-] up. So the dumpling is ready and we can get them out and enjoy this delicious  food.   

<ST 4>  <band 6> <title TRUST> What is trust?  Trust is often thought to be similar with "to believe", but in fact it's  more than that.  When you say "I believe him", you actually mean you believe what he says,  while when you  say "I trust you", you think he is someone honest and reliable. You can  believe someone as  long as you think he (she) is telling the truth, no matter who he (she)  is and how much you  know about him (her). But can you "trust" a stranger as well?  Obviously the answer is "no". To trust, the first prerequisite is to  understand. The two  factors that trust bases on ,honesty and reliability, are not something  you can find from  someone on the first sight .These characters can only be found and confirmed  through the  understanding between people. Those who deserve your trust, usually are  either your good  friends, or your eldership [wd3,-]. Someone recognized to be honest is sometimes  thought to be  trusty, too. But such trust to [np1,-] a person is of another kind. It [pr2,-]'s like the  admiration to [np1,-] a man of  fame. In such kind of trust, you are just showing your attitude ,like saying  "I trust the  government", and may get no response. But the trust between friends is quite different. It's mutual. Being trusted  is as important  as trusting others. Being trusted means some kind of responsibility and  being regarded,  without which one may feel lonely and the "unbearable lightness of being".  Everybody has  the need for feeling strong by giving others support, as well as a shoulder  to rely on when  feeling weak [sn2,-]. Such feelings make everyone needs [vp5,-] friends, and trust is just  the way to  friendship. Such is trust, an essential factor of friendship. It's more than to believe,  or to help, or to rely, or honesty. It's a basic need of human life.  

<ST 4>  <band 6> <title How To Make Dumplings> Dumpling [np6,-] is the most traditional food in China. Almost every family  eats dumplings on their traditional festival--the spring festival. Making  dumplings is not a trouble job that [cj1,-] you may consider, but it needs correct  process. I'll explain the process in the following paragraphs.  The first step is to prepare the dumpling wrappers. Mix the powder  with water to make dough, [sn9,-] which shouldn't be too soft or too hard. Then  shape the dough into slim column, and cut it into small dough. We can  make the small dough into wrappers with a rolling pin. The good wrapper  is in the shape of fine round, and the center of the wrapper should be  thicker than its rim to prevent stuffing from leaving.  The next step is to make stuffing. The dumpling's stuffing often  contains meat, vegetables and eggs. What we should do is to slice meet,  cut up vegetables, such as Chinese cabbage or chives, beat eggs and mix  all of them together. Then add some condiment to stuffing to make it  more delicious. The taste of stuffing is very important, because the taste  of dumplings depends on it.  We have had the wrappers and stuffing prepared, and now what we  should do is to wrap dumplings. Put some stuffing on a wrapper, then fold  the wrapper and hold it together to make a boat shape. The one thing we  should take care is not to add too much stuffing, otherwise the dumplings  may be torn when boiled. The last thing is to put the dumplings into water  then boil them until they emerge on water.  Now we can have a good traditional meal.   

<ST 4>  <band 6> <title How to Make Jiao Zi (Chinese Dumplings)>     Jiao Zi is a kind of traditional Chinese food. It is famous and popular for  the long history and [wd4,-] delectable taste. Making Jiao Zi is not very difficult.  Everyone can do it under the following instructions, however, practice is very  important, say, [sn1,-] more practice, more gains.      Firstly, let's make dough and "Jiao Zi Pi"(dumpling skins). Add some water  to flour, blend and knead thoroughly. Do not add more water until it is  absolutely necessary, that is, getting as hard a dough as you can. If the dough is  too soft, add more flour. Harder dough is much easier to fill [vp7,-]. Chill [wd7,-] a while before  you make skins.       When chilling the dough, we can prepare the filling. Take out your food  processor. Don't tell me you don't have. It could be terribly tiresome if you try to  mince everything with a knife, especially when you want to serve more people.  However, using a machine or knife [np6,-] is up to you. After meat is finely minced, add  soy sauce and salt to it. Stir slowly, always in the same direction  (this could  make the meat fiber stick well, or [wd3,-] the Jiao Zi are more likely to fall apart when  cooked). Then prepare vegetables and other additional ingredients, for example,  minced cabbage as the main filling, some flavoring like [fm2,-] finely minced ginger,  onion etc. Stir them slowly into the meat mixture. Don't let the mix get too moist.  After the mixture is done, you should test scent [cc3,-]. It should be very aromatic. If  not, add a little sesame oil. Then test consistency. Fry a teaspoon or so of the  mix. It should stick together very easily. If it falls apart, it could be because  either the mix is too dry in which case add more vegetables [sn7,-] or its [fm1,-] too moist in  which case add a little more meat  [sn7,-]. At last, test flavor [cc3,-] . You can eat the fried bit or  make one Jiao Zi as the test or just lick [wd3,-] a little raw thing (not so hygiene, but  convenient). If necessary, add a few spices to supplement [wd5,-].      When the filling is ok, we can continue our work with the dough. Separate  dough into two portions. Form [wd4,-] into long sausages, about 3~4cm diameter [sn2,-]. Cut [wd4,-] sections every 2cm. Form sections into balls and use rolling pin to form into  round, flat skins. You may need extra flour or a little peanut oil for this [wd4,-] in order  to preventing [vp5,-] the dough sticking to your hands and the rolling pin. This step is  probably the hardest in the whole work. If I were you, I would go to the  supermarket to purchase a package of pre-made dumpling skins.      Then we come to the most technical and artistic step--rolling. Take about  1 [wd7,-] tablespoon filling and place into center [np6,-] of skin. Bring one half [wd4,-] up to meet the  other half. Seal thoroughly. This usually means creating "pleats" in one half and  gluing them to the other, Your dumpling should look like a half-moon with a big  bulge in the middle! [sn1,-] If they're not well sealed, they fall apart when cooking [vp5,-].  Please be patient when rolling, how happy you are when seeing more and more  dumpling babies produced by your own hands. [sn1,-]      After one or two hours work, do you get enough Jiao Zi to serve yourself or  your guests or friends? At least you must have some to cook. Bring large pot of  water to boil. Then add enough Jiao Zi to cover the base of the pot. Take good  care of your pot, when water comes to a boil, add 1 cup [np2,-] cold water. [sn1,-] Cover.  Repeat. When it [pr2,-] comes to a boil for the third time, they are ready to serve.       To serve is also dainty. Jiao Zi is typically eaten with a sauce constructed [wd3,-]  of soy sauce, vinegar, and sugar. Also good with plain malt vinegar. [sn2,-] For more  flavor, try to add a little sesame oil, hot oil, [wd4,-] mustard as you wish. Ok, let's stop,  you can enjoy yourself now. [sn1,-] MY TUTOR'S TWO SIDES It has been almost three years since I was directed by my tutor. Like most  teachers in Tsinghua University, he is an ordinary-looking man and often in plain  dress. The appearance makes him looked [vp5,-] like not a profound professor, but a common  retired worker. In my opinion, all professors in Tsinghua University have some  collective characters [cc4,-], but everyone of them is unique. What he impresses me deeply is  his vigorousness [fm2,-] and eloquence. The following two stories are the best proofs. My tutor is sixty years old. He is thin but healthy, in particular, he is good at  walking. [sn1,-] Last term, I went to Kunming with him for a research in Lancang River.  Fortunately, the World Horticultural Expo was performing in the city, so I have a  chance to visit the garden with my old tutor. We got [vp1,-] the garden at about eight o'clock  in the morning. on [fm3,-] a sunshiny day and began our long walking. [sn2,-] The garden was so  tremendous and attractive that we were deeply magnetized by the scene, even we  forgot the tire [wd2,-]. [sn1,-] We had not stopped seeing and walking until we had a brief lunch at  noon. After the lunch, the old man said to me with great exciting [wd2,-], "Let's continue our  visit, the garden is so beautiful. [sn1,-]" After that, I found it difficult to keep up with him  though I had tried my best. We completed our visit at four o'clock in the afternoon.  Our long walking had lasted for more than seven hours except the time for lunch. I  was really tired and felt all parts of my body were sore. At this time, my tutor said to  me, "My boy, are you interested in watching the night scene of the city with me?" I  answered with a bitter smile, "I am interested in watching the night scene of the city  in the bed of the hotel." Another side which makes me admire my tutor is his eloquence. But I think his  eloquence is mostly based on his profound knowledge. Last year, an important group  that would decided [vp9,-] a large contract came to our department. But before our welcome,  the opponent had carried them away [wd3,-] and contacted [vp1,-] with them for a day. The situation  is serious for us. However, when the group arrived and began to talk about the  contract, my tutor made his wonderful speech. He showed them dozens of books  which collected all the research achievements of us and began to talk about his  opinion on the contact. One hour late [aj2,-], when his speech was over, the leader of the  group said, "Excellent, you have got the 75 percent of the contact."  This is my tutor, a common professor of Tsinghua, and an energetic and  well-spoken man.   

<ST 4>  <band 6> <title The classification of professional sports> Most professional sports can be classified as group sports or individual sports,  according to the number of players. Individual sports are those that the players of each side are not more than two  persons, such as golf and tennis, etc. Some kinds of individual sports can play [vp7,-] only [ad1,-] by  single person each side, though golf belongs to these kinds. But other kinds of  individual sports can play [vp7,-] either by single person or by double persons, for example  tennis. Although individual sports can be run among groups sometimes, still they are  called individual sports because one game can not be played by all players at the same  time, but in turns. In facts [np2,-], they are still played by single person or double persons, but  calculated by groups in this situation [wd7,-].  Group sports are those that each side of them is more than two players, such as  football, the most popular sports [np3,-] in the world. The victory of group sports depends on  not only the skill of every player but also the cooperation of the team, and sometimes  super stars are very import [fm1,-] for a team to win the game. There are many other ways to classify the professional sports. But the  classification ahead is a basic and simple one.

<ST 4>  <band 6> <title Aims of My Life> One should have his aims of life, and also need to establish, cancel or modify some aims. If  you are pursuing a valuable and regretnessless [fm2,-] life, you had better to clarify the aims of your life.  So I classify the aims of my life as follows. There can be two kinds of aims in all: abstract aims and concrete aims. My abstract aim is living [vp5,-] for the truth, kindness and beauty of the world. This aim is nor [fm1,-] to do  something, but it is the demand thought [fm1,-] my life, and will not be changed [wd4,-] all my life. My concrete aims have too much [np8,-] content [np6,-], so I put them into two categories further: short-tern [fm1,-]  aims and long-term aims. My short-term aims can be different in the next day. They are some concrete things that I have  to do, for example, to finish this English article, to study the project in my laboratory, to get my  Ph.D degree, etc. [sn1,-]  My long-term aims are something to do in all the rest of my life. For example, to make our  electrical products more functional and reliable, to improve my parent's life, to do my best to  repay my teachers and my friends. [sn1,-] All my aims are list above, according to the clarification, and in order not to lose my aims of  life.

She is my three years old niece, [sn9,-] whom I often think of in my daily life.  

<ST 4>  <band 6> <title A scene or something introduction>  THVenus-1 Small satellite  Lying in the center of the clean-room is a small satellite called THVenus-1. Sitting on  its launch pad frame, the satellite is a cubic object whose six facets are covered with  thermal panels and brilliantly blazing in the sunshine beam [cc1,-] through the windows. The  size of the satellite is about 90cm wide and 120cm high, not so big as people think a  satellite mostly should be. [sn1,-]  Detached from the thermal panels, the satellite, with cubic Aluminum frame structure  and modular layered stacks, has machined module boxes stacked one on top of the  other to form a body onto which solar panels and instruments may be mounted. The  mass of the satellite is normally from 35 kg to 70 kg and its structure is qualified to  carry up to 35kg payloads. Each module box houses the various subsystems, for  example, batteries, power conditioning, onboard data handling, communications and  attitude control. Payloads are housed either in similar modules or on top of the  earth-directing platform alongside antennas and attitude sensors.  Electronically the satellite uses modern, sophisticated, but not necessarily  space-proven, electronic circuits to provide a high degree of capability. These are  underpinned by space-proven subsystems - resulting in a layered architecture that  achieves high performance with operational redundancy by using alternative  technologies rather than by simple duplication. All the software can be reloaded from  the ground station, increasing the reliability of the satellite and providing the  opportunity to continually enhance the technological function onboard the satellite.  This satellite is mainly used for remote sensing and communication. Mounted with  multi-spectrum cameras that take earth images from 650km orbit at 30m resolution, it  is capable of monitoring the earth disasters such as forest fire and regional flood. An  extra communication payload can also provide some consumer with message store  and forward services.   Small satellite is cost¨Ceffective and has short design, testing and manufacture  time ,because of the use of common commercial components. With more modern  technology integrated and miniaturized, it can be a powerful tool for people to explore  our home planet.   

<ST 4>  <band 6> <title A person I admire> My husband is of medium height and a little fat. Sometimes he is lazy and untidy;  sometimes he likes the delicious food so much, but these are not his main characters.  What really attract me are the following aspects. Same with a lot of peoples who graduated from Tsinghua University, he is clever,  but his intelligence is different from the others. His bright [wd2,-] is not inherent. His  endeavor is the source of it. That is to say[sn9,-] that [wd5,-] he accumulated all of his knowledge by  himself and he [wd6,-] has memorized all of them. I never understand how can [vp9,-] his brain hold  so many things. He can use mathematics in any fields [np3,-]. Obviously, because his specialty is  electronics, math is an important tool for his scientific research. When I asked him a  question that is not relative with math, for example, a chemistry experiment, he will  finally find a math method to solve it. When we fell in love, he used math to study  why we could love each other and whether we would live together in the future. He seldom leaves a question for another day. He often has a lot of new and  wonderful ideas, but the fact is that he often finds a new question before he leaves his  office. He will [wd4,-] think of his supper until he solves that question. If he can't solve it  immediately, he will work all night. When you see him tomorrow morning, he will  tell you the right answer. This is my husband, who is a person I admire more.   

<ST 4>  <band 6> <title Western Musical Instruments> A musical instrument can be defined as any mechanism that produces musical sounds. All  western musical instruments usually [ad1,-] are classified in five categories: 1.	String instruments. The violin, viola, cello, double bass, harp and guitar are string  instruments. The strings are the same parts of them. The musician makes a string  vibrate with the right hand and controls pitch by the left hand. "Shanbo Liang and  Yingtai Zhu" is a famous violin concert in our country. 2.	Woodwind and brass instruments.  Woodwind instruments are made of wood, which have a unique tone color. The  piccolo, flute, oboe, and saxophone are members of this group. In our early war films, the trumpet sounds mean all of the soldiers are charging [vp1,-]  the enemy lines. The trumpet is one of brass instruments. The other is born. In "Blue  Danube", the violin first brings us a silent morning of Danube, then the born brings  the main melody to us. 3.	Percussion Instruments. Percussion instruments are subdivided into two parts. One is  definite pitch, for example, the timpani, xylophone, celesta and chimes. The other is  indefinite pitch, including the bass drum, triangle, gong and so on. 4.	Keyboard Instruments. The piano, harpsichord, organ, and accordion are the  well-known keyboard instruments. During the nineteenth and early twentieth  centuries, the piano was a status symbol. Any middle-class family had it.  5.	Electronic Instruments. Same with the name, electronic instruments produce or  amplify sound through electronic means. Instruments also can be classified into the same five categories based on the  way [wd4,-] sound is made. For string instruments, a stretched string is the sound generator;  for woodwind and brass instruments, a column of air is the sound generator; [sn9,-] and so on.    

<ST 4>  <band 6> <title Friendship> Xiaowang is a young architect. Last year, he and I entered a bid [cc3,-] of an  office building design. It was a risk for us. The task would be calculated  to cost 15000 yuans. If we would not win the bid, we could only get  10000 yuans. If we were lucky to win, we could get 50000 yuans.   Unfortunately, we lost the bid. [Both] Xiaowang and I wasted about 2500  yuans [wd4,-] each other. Although we felt depressed on the result, we  cooperated harmoniously. Friendship between us has gone [a] step further.  We decided that we would work together next time if we had a chance. Two months ago, our group went to qufu [fm3,-] in Shandong for a visit. It is a  famous tour city. When we talk about how to begin our visit in hotel hall,  a stranger came to us. He asked us whether we would need help or not. In  fact we thought a tourist guide was necessary. We supposed that he could  make our trip efficiently [wd2,-]. He guided us enthusiastically [for the] whole  day and his service satisfied with [vp1,-] us. Finally, we paid for him 30 yuans,  which he required. Before he went away, he said: "we became friends  now, welcome to qufu [fm3,-] again. [sn1,-]" But I thought no one of us regarded him as a friend. I consider that friendship is not to be paid for. Everyone wish [vp3,-] that your  friend would help you with no commercial aim. Take the case a man [vp9,-] trying to decide whether to save a child who can not swim in a river or  not. If he save [vp3,-] him for a high prize, most of us must think that he is not a  noble person. If he just want [vp3,-] to save a life for nothing, he is regarded as a  hero. Friendship can't be judged by money. The real friend is someone  who will help you if you need help not for benefiting from. Still, we have trouble coming up with a precise definition of friendship.  In some Chinese traditional novels, friendship means to contribute  everything to your friend even a life if they need. The most famous example  is about three people who became brothers in a peach garden. They vowed to dedicate their lives to each  other and they kept their promises at the end. Their names are liubei, guanyu and zhangfei. Guyu even had  became a god of friendship in many old Chinese's hearts. But money is coming more important now. We are  thrown into confusion of the relations between money and emotion. It may be a joke if the story of three  brothers happens in modern society. Today it seems that the standard of friend is lower than before. The  model of friend, which we often describe, is [wd4,-] who will listen to you when you talk about your problems or  whom you can argue with and not lose your temper [sn6,-]. Although they can not contribute their lives to their  friends, they are faithful. The most important character is that friendship can't be got  [bought] by money.

<ST 4>  <band 6> <title Comparison between online and offline education> Both online and offline education now exist well in China.  Online education is a new mode of education, while offline education is a traditional one. Compared with  traditional education, online education will fundamentally change teaching techniques. In the new mode of online education, teacher's [np6,-] function will mainly be to guide and organize the students [np1,-],  while the students themselves will take the learning process. But in the traditional mode, educators need to  impart the knowledge, as well as help students design their learning schedule [np6,-]. Computer becomes very important in online education, as an essential teaching tool. In traditional education,  the most basic and important implements are chalk and blackboard. During online class, teachers will give the students more time to think and talk, in order that[wd5,-] to develop their  comprehensive abilities . As a typical character, only teachers always being [vp9,-] talking all along,  [wd4,-] students get few  chances to speak and think in traditional class. However, based on the application of Internet technology, online education will cost very much now in China.  As the low speed and high cost of Internet services, offline education still be provided and exists well.

He educates me by his own means. I admire him most. Hardworking is the common virtue on [np1,-] people of my father's time as well as guilelessness. My father was  born from [vp2,-] a poor family. In his childhood he and his ffifamily [fm1,-] are [vp6,-] always in hunger. To make a living, he has [vp6,-]  to work in his school holidays and do much housework with his brother when young [sn7,-].

<ST 4>  <band 6> <title The Person I Admire Most>      Everybody has someone to admire, maybe a star, a famous figure, or his  intimate person. For me, this character is my elder brother, who is strong-minded,  valorous, and virtuous. He made me wiser and kinder, and taught me how to face life  calmly.      When he was a child, my brother dreamed of controling [fm1,-] his own life in the  future. After growing up, once [vp9,-] he made his mind? nothing [fm3,-] could change it. When he  graduated from the high school, there were two choices for him, one is Beijing  University, the other a herbalist college. In spite of many people's disapproval, he still  chose the latter, because he enjoyed the Chinese ancient culture and wanted to devote  himself to it. Later he achieved his aim and opened a personal clinique [fm1,-] in Qingdao,  which he is very proud of now. He is not wealthy, but very rich in spiritual world. I  still remember his intelligent words: "Do the things you like and live for yourself. "      His bravery gains my admiration, too. With only several hundred RMB he went  to Tibet alone to explore the archaic civilization. It was so venturesome that I didn't  know if he could be back safely. After a three-day-travel [fm2,-] by train, he was picked up by  a truck passing by to reach the destination. It took him about two weeks to appreciate  the nature, the religion and the life habits there. Sometimes he slept outdoors, [sn9,-]                           in his  sleeping sack. When he came back home, he looked thin and black, but his eyes were  shining. From the nice smile on his face, I felt a kind of enviable happiness.  "Sometimes you should go beyond yourself", he told me.       In addition, he hopes himself to live like a gentleman in ancient China, so he is  strict in his traits. Sometimes he goes to countryside, with his apparatus for  acupuncture, to cure the local people almost freely and search the lost medical  methods. When a patient recovers, he is very pleased, for he feels he can help them  with his own hands.      Although my brother lives an ordinary life, without sensational success, he has  something other people cannot own. In my eyes, he is so special, so impressing, and I  can't help adoring him. His thoughts and deeds always help me, guide me and inspire  me.  

<ST 4>  <band 6> <title The Confusing Man> In this article, I'll describe the person who confused me most. With the famous fistful square mustache, he was a short, thin man but was always  aggressive, adept at extemporizing and instigating. For many people, he had a  complex character, even was a fiend [sn2,-]. From his theory on races, other races were low-grade while Nordic was the noblest.  So when he became the head of his nation, he set his foot on the way of conquering  other races especially on the Jew. What he had done brought the human race agonies  and slaughters, made his name a synonym of the Satan. [sn1,-] Though his theory on races was so insane and irrational, he had the ability to  agitate others to follow him. While he was in prison, he wrote a book that made him  adored by many people. Later He became the sovereign and finally enkindled the  World War￠ò.Who can imagine he once [ad1,-] was a beggar! There is seldom person [np6,-] who can change the whole history of the world just like  him. So many people worship him, so many people hate him and so many died [vp6,-]  because of him. Having read this, maybe everyone know [vp3,-] who he is. Yes, he is Adolf Hitler. He has gone for years, but his ghost is still poisoning the world so much. Today  there are still many new Nazis, some of who even has [vp3,-] entered the Austrian cabinet.  Why his theory can make so many people infatuated, both in 1930s and now?  He had done great injuries to the world. I wish there won't be a second! A Teacher of Mine     When I was still a young boy in the senior middle school, I was impressed  deeply by my teacher of language and literature course. Even now, I often miss him,  and write to him. What he has given me is not only knowledge, but also the basic  principles of treating others and facing life.     He is thin, and has a moderate stature. He is a little bald. All the time, he has a  pair of light brown glasses on his nose, and keeps his coat tidy. If he were staring at  you, you would never feel sharp. On the contrary, you would feel amiable. You could  see it [pr2,-]'s full of kindness and humor in his eyes. In short, he is the kind of person that  you can know he is a teacher at the first glance when you meet him in the street.     He is a man full of humor. Not only very interesting, but also abundant of  wisdom is his course. [sn2,-] Never is he going to adopt the dull and mechanic means to give  lessons, because he thinks this course itself should be vivid, and the purpose of it  should be to cultivate the students' ability [cc3,-] of using language and their feelings of  literature appreciation. So as many ways as he can, [sn3,-] he has tried to make the students  active and the air of the classroom relaxed. For example, he often asked us to perform  in the classroom according to our understanding of the text. Almost every time, the  performance may look funny, and make all of us laugh. [vp6,-] But it did increase our interest  on the course itself. As a result, we often got high scores in the examinations.     He loves his job and his students very much. As a teacher, he knows how much  he will affect his students with even one word or a small action. In our class, he never  looked down on [vp2,-] any students, even those who never got high scores in the  examination. But it didn't mean that he wasn't strict with us. If we had made mistakes,  he would criticize us. But he would do it in a much more humor [wd2,-] way that would make  you understand that you were wrong never feeling hurt [sn6,-]. We all liked to talk with him  sometimes [sn9,-] even being criticized, because all of us knew that he loved us. He uses his  action to practice the idea that the main purpose of a teacher should be to help his  students to grow up healthily, not to make them become the people only fit [vp5,-] for  examinations. [sn1,-]     So when I got the message that he was cancered two years ago, I was very  shocked. Why is life so cruel to such a person who loves it so much. So many things,  such as his job, his students, his family and so on, is [vp3,-] needed [vp7,-] him. I can't imagine what  all of these will be without him. But he has accepted all calmly, and faced life with  great optimism. Even on the way to the operating room, he was still full of optimism.  "All will become better!", he said. What a great courage should be needed!  Fortunately, his surgery was very successful. Now, a little weak as his body is, he  can go back to the classroom to stay with his students and go on give his interesting  lessons. This is my teacher who I admire. He is not only a good teacher, but also a  beneficial friend. He uses his word and action to show me what kind of person I  should be. And now I see the direction [cc3,-]. I will try my best to be a man full of humor. [sn9,-]  love and optimism just like him.

<ST 4>  <band 6> <title My Mother> My mother is the woman I admire most. She is an ordinary woman of medium  height. Although she is about 60 years old and her hair is already silvering with gray,  she looks vigorous with two sharp eyes in her face. She had worked in a factroy for  about 30 years as a senior engineer and she was retired from the business when she  was 55.  My mother has many good virtues. She teaches me a lot of principles of how to  be a good man: being warmhearted, being hardworking and being responsible for  what you did. My mother is very kindhearted. She likes to help others, whether an acquaintance  or a stranger. She also teaches me to do so. When I was in junior high school, my  parents brought a boy from our shirttail relative to my family. He and I were of the  same age and went to the same school. In my eyes, he was so countrified and stupid  because he came from a village. My classmates often laughed at him, sometime [fm1,-] they  laughed at me. [sn1,-] I felt I lost my face, so I often complained about it. One day, my  mother had a talk with me. It was the first time that I saw my mother weeping. She  told me that when she was still at college, my grandmother died. " At that time, so  many people helped me. Now we lives [vp3,-] much better than before, why can't we help  others? " she said. I was so impressed and embarrassed. From then on I never  complained about it. My mother is not only warmhearted, she is [wd5,-] also [cj2,-] hardworking. When she was at  college, the foreign language she learned was Russian. But her work made her have to  learn English. She was not young at that time, but she did her best to learn it. She was  so modest and often asked my old sister for advice. After years of hard studying, she  passed the English examination for a senior engineer's qualification. Last summer, I  bought a computer, she was attracted by it. [sn1,-] Now she can use many softwares expertly,  such as "Word" and "Excel" , she can also contact with me by Email and surf on  Internet. [sn1,-] Besides these two points above, what impressed me most is [vp6,-] that she taught me to  be responsible for what I did. I still remember a thing that happened 15 years ago. My  little fellows and I picked many unripe peaches from my neighbor's trees. My  neighbor was angry, but he didn't know who did it. I was afraid to tell the truth to my  family. About several months later, my nother [fm1,-] knew it. She brought me immediately  to my neighbor's house to apologize for it. She also told me:"You should be  responsible for what you did, if you don't do so, you are not a true man. [sn1,-]" When I said  sorry to my neighbor, he had already forgot it. This is my mother. She is so ordinary, but is [wd6,-] so great in my eyes. She teaches me  many things. She tells me to try my best in every trivia and in fact she does so. She is  the woman I admire most.

<ST 4>  <band 6> <title My favorite teacher> Like all my classmates at the high school, [sn3,-] Ms [fm1,-] Liu is my favorite teacher. He has many qualities that students appreciate. He is not only students' good teacher but also their considerate friend. 	At the classroom he is a good teacher. He is very patient, when he explains the  lessons and answers questions. In his class students never feel embarrassed although  referring to a weak or irrelevant question. Except that, Ms [fm1,-] Liu can express himself  very clearly. His stentorian voice attracts all students wherever they sit. When coming across important points, he always keeps students' attention through his  humor. Certainly, he can also organize his class very well. At the beginning of the  semester, he hands out his class schedule. Having the idea of an entire semester work,  students can budget their time efficiently. Moreover, Ms [fm1,-] Liu promptly corrects and  returns assignments and tests. He is very strict in giving grades, not willing either to  give one mark more or one mark less than students deserve. All of these can permit students fairly to value themselves and to learn from their mistakes to produce better work in the next assignments. In a word, he always keeps his dignity of a teacher in his class. 	But as soon as school is over, he becomes students' friend. He often drops off [wd3,-]  students' dormitory in order to have a chat with them, learn about their life and solve  the troubles [cc3,-] they may have. He also likes to play football games with his students.  Although not young, he, like a child, runs on the playground so his students never feel  bound together with him. He keeps in constant touch with his students and induces them to study hard and behave well. He always set [vp3,-] a good example himself so as to  influence his students. He keeps in touch not only students but also their families in order to learn obtain [vp5,-] the assistance of parents in instructing students. He tries to learn about students' conditions so that he helps such student having bad conditions and warns them to avoid being influenced all the time. 	However, Ms [fm1,-] Liu is my favorite teacher. It is certainly believed that he sets the example of an ideal teacher who can consider all for his students and can become a thoughtful teacher in the future. 

 
<ST 4>  <band 6> <title My Teacher In High School>      	Mr. Hu is my high school teacher, and in my mind he is the best. 	He is ordinary, not tall and not short, and always dressed common.  Full of energy all day, he seems young even though he is in his fifties. 	He had taught me throughout my high-school years. At that time, he  was the master of our class, teaching us maths. In my mind, he was strict  with not only us but also his work. On the April First day, we thought  out an interesting problem of maths. To play a joke, we pretended that  it was so difficult that we could not solve it and had to ask him for help.  In fact, the key we prepared for the problem was very simple. To our surprise,  after a while he handed us a piece of paper, on which was full of writing.  That was the full key. We looked at each other, smiling. 	During my high school life, I had received a lot of help from him.  And even though I have studied in Tsinghua for so many years, being taught  by so many teachers, the best teacher I admire is him.  									 

<ST 4>  <band 6> <title What does HATRED means?>     
From the sky, the bombs of NATO are thrown at Yugosvlavia like skyscoketing [fm1,-],  and on the ground, thousands of Albanian people are forced to leave their  homeland like ants. The TV screen is full of such bloody scenes.    All of those are due to one word: HATRED.    We can hardly find hatred in other kinds of animals. Only human beings  is cannibalistic genus. The hatred between two families can last  for tens  of dozens of years and lead to murder. The hatred between two nations lasting  hundreds of years can bring wars. The etaliation [fm1,-] fashions are always very  bloody and cruel. We can say that the history of civilization is also the  history of hatred. The more advanced civilization is, the larger scale  slaughter happen [vp3,-]. We have sound reason to say that perdition of human beings  will due to hatred between themselves.    The hatred between two families is due to small dissisions [fm1,-], while the  hatred betwween [fm1,-] two nations is caused by many factors such as differences  between religions, wars in history, disagreement on boundary and lack of  resources, etc.    However, we still have chances. I am not a futilitarian, but we should strive together for the peace of the world. Virtuous people, organized! [vp4,-] It [pr2,-]'s still [ad1,-] time for sound sleep. Pulled by a string tied between two beds in the room of 10 square meters, she got up.  Another new and difficult day coming, she dexterously cooked supper, served  father, then hurried to school. What has burdened such a little girl with a hard life? Unlike other children enjoying comfortable living conditions and parents' love, she spent her childhood in tears: Suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, her father could only lie in bed; Mother mercilessly went away. Since then, the heavy burden of life fell on the frail shoulders of the girl. To cure the disease, they had sold all the valuable things except the small house. Housework and attendance upon Father occupied most of her time after school. She couldn't do her homework until it [pr2,-]'s  deep into night. She acted as an adult at home and a student at school, even nurse [np6,-] of her father. [sn1,-] In order to respond to father's demands of having medicine or injection as quickly as possible, she thought of a  good idea, tie her ankle to father's bed with a string. Each time father pulled the string, she could wake up and help him. Seeing the string and the tiredness of daughter, Father often preferred enduring pain to pulling the string. Recalling mother's leaving, the little girl felt painful. After all, she's not at the age of becoming the only  hope and support of the family, of tasting the bitterness and hardships  of human life [sn2,-]. The misfortune, however, impelled her to grow up. She demonstrated her strong character  not only by hard work at  home, but by perfect performance at school. In teachers and students' eyes, she was a good student; although she had no new clothes, she was very clean. While her companions walked between fruitshop [fm2,-]  and toyshop, she paid much attention to those dustbins [wd7,-] to make money; while  friends were happily [wd2,-] with  father and mother, she lonely walked back home thinking of father's health. As time went on, the Spring Festival was coming. On the New Year's Eve, when firecrackers exploded outside, she sent father a gift, a paper which read [vp3,-] "Dear father: wish  you happy new year and recover [vp5,-]  soon." That was really a beautiful dream. Day by day, the string was pulled over and over, the spirit [wd7,-] and  the daughter kept on taking care of her father. It is a life tied by string, not a common string, but a "dutiful daughter string" woven by daughter's sweat and true feelings.   
<ST 4>  <band 6> <title How I Became A Sleepy Man> I am a sleepy man and I always have more than 10 hours' sleep per day.  Some people, especially those teachers who  often catch me sleeping in their classes, are quite interested in this:  they constantly ask me why I think sleeping is  much more important than other things like listening to their lessons.  I have no answer for them, because I know  that they would not believe the real reason, sometimes I do not believe  it either. [sn1,s]What? You want to hear the story?  OK, I can tell it to you, but I am sure you will not believe it. Ten years ago, when I was still in primary school, I was an energetic boy whose average sleep time was 6~7 hours  per day. And I never fell asleep in classes. But all these were changed in a midnight, which I would never forget. It was a cold winter night. After the TV programs had finished, I said  "Good night" to my parents and entered my own room. It was 10:30 pm as I lay myself in the bed. Mimi, my cat, jumped up to me as usual. Playing with him  or a while, I fell asleep quickly. Suddenly, an abnormal sound outside the window waked me up. The sound was so abnormal that Mimi erected his tail like a flagpole. I looked outside.  Oh, my god! Frightened by what I had seen, I covered my eyes with my hands. Through the gaps between my fingers I could recognize it: " a UFO!" Just before I  could let my cry out, a flash came out of it and hit me. I lost my consciousness at once, only hearing a dreadful cry  of Mimi?-How long had passed? I did not know. As I opened my eyes, I found myself lying on a flat table, with  several strange creatures standing round me. They were blue-skinned, undressed, and as short as children in  kindergartens. Strange voices came out of their abdomens, which looked  as they were talking about something.  " I'm KIDNAPED by these ugly creatures." an idea went across my mind, "But  what will they do to me?" After a  few minutes, all the strange voices stopped [sn9,-] indicating that they had come  to an agreement [sn2,-]. Suddenly, I was floated in the air. Right above my head, I saw a black hole. As I wondered, a white laser beam flashed out of it and shot me in the head. Of course, I fainted again...I appeared in my bed again when I came back to life. Mimi was standing on my chest, staring at me curiously. God! I felt there was something heavy in my head. "Ma Ma!" I cried out. " You would never sleep good until you annoyed everyone, would you?" my mother came in, "Be quiet and sleep,  OK? It's 11:00 now." "11:00? That's impossible. It must be midnight now. Ma, I was kidnaped?-" "Stop your silly words and go to sleep as quickly as you can, PLEASE."  Mother arranged the quilt I kicked off and stepped out. Although I was still afraid and curious about what had happened, the heavy thing in my head prevented me from continuing my thinking. I fell asleep quickly. You must have known the end of the story: the next day when I told my parents  about my adventure last night, they  did not believe it at all. My father even said that he would reduce my money on science fictions. But I know exactly that all these were real, because there WAS something heavy in my head, planted by those creatures, [sn2,-] which began to  make me often sleepy. From then on, I became a sleepy man with more than 10 hours' sleep per day; all are attributed to the heavy thing in my head. I never told this story to others except those who are convesant [fm1,-] to me:  I know no one will believe it, just as my  parents. Do you believe it?                                                                                            
<ST 4>  <band 6> <title ?>	 Bible[np7,-] tells us God bestowed light on us, with the effortless words:  "Let there be light." I don't believe that  because light is given after great pains, [wd4,-] even after life dedicated [vp7,-]. 	Two years ago when I flied away from my parents' "nest", everything  was new to me: the new job, the new  time table, and the new apartment I chose to live in. As a matter of fact,  it was an old three-story-tall [wd5,-] building, and  my apartment was on the top floor. The staircase was terribly dark, the  only illumination provided [vp7,-] by an  dust-covered light bulb. [sn1,-] I guessed it was seldom turned on because the  cord serving as the switch was so short as to  make it impossible to reach it without stretching the arm. Actually I was  right: few people were willing to do such a  "trifle," and light rarely patronized the somewhat Stygian staircase;  everyone was apathetic maybe, I cynically  thought. 	But it was not always the case. It was several months later, when  I was almost accustomed to the darkness.[sn2,-]  One evening I got back late from work after finishing the last line of  my program. It was getting dark outside, and as  I entered the building, the light somehow went on! The unexpected brightness  almost transfixed me. Doubt was in  my mind as I stepped upstairs [cc3,-]. Then I saw her, a skinny girl of seven or  eight, her complexion exceptionally blond,  or pale in fact [sn2,-]. She was getting off a footstool carefully when she noticed  me, and then she gave me a sweet smile as  greeting. Obviously it was she who just turned on the long-dormant light.  I said hello back and started a conversation. She told me she was Jessy, my new next-door neighbor. She thought the staircase would be too dark at night, so she had come down to turn on the light. Apparently she was too short for the job, so she took the footstool.  Before the little helper bid me farewell, she invited me to visit her sometime.  	I would always like to visit Jessy, but as I was too busy and as I was gradually used to the light, I rarely thought of the skinny girl. Perhaps I would never think of visiting her [sn9,-] had not this quotidian practice ceased shortly  after Christmas. So I decided to visit my warm-hearted friend. 	I knocked at the door, planning to ask why she had quitted the laudable job, but it was her mother there. I asked where my friend Jessy was. Then I felt something wrong as I saw tears in the lady's eyes.  "She's in heaven. She had leukemia." 	I felt my heart stricken [wd4,-] a sudden blow. Hardly did I remember to give my consolations [np5,-] when I ran away with a  mixed feeling. I recollected every segment of reminiscence [np6,-] of the girl.  After sorrows subsided, I found myself somehow before the light Jessy had been taking care of. All of a sudden, everything about the respectable little girl emerged as only one word: "light." She had taught me the meaning of life:  to love, to care about others; she had turned on the most illumining light of my life, but she lost her own life. The light in the staircase resumed going on and off every day. Guess who did it?  Free Tickets Last Sunday my uncle went to attend a pop music concert with his girlfriend, and they agreed to meet at the theatre.  When my uncle arrived, there were already crowds of people outside the theatre, who hadn't got the tickets but wished to see their favorite singers. [sn1,-] 	The concert was about to begin when his girlfriend called to say that she was too ill to come. Considering that he should go to take care of her, my uncle decided to give away the tickets.  He said to the crowd," I have two tickets to share with a friend, but since she can't come today, I want to give them away. And the tickets are free." 	After his announcement, however, my uncle was astonished to find that people kept silent and just looked at  him curiously. He shouted it again, but still there was no reply. And some  people even turned away and murmured to  one another, showing their mistrust. A boy cried, "Who do you want to make a fool?" "Go home, young man. Even a devil won't believe you, bot [fm1,-] maybe an angel will." Another man shouted  ironically. And the crowd burst into laughter. That made my uncle very angry, and he went away. 	After a short while, my uncle returned. This time raising the tickets  high, he said," Two tickets left, each 100 yuan." Right away, he found himself surrounded by eager people with money in their hands. And at last, my uncle sold the two tickets at 150 yuan each.

<ST 4>  <band 6> <title Qi, I am waiting for you in the cafe>. 
My Heart Will Go On 
Every night, in the same cafe, at the same table, the same boy appeared.  Each time, he ordered a cup of  coffee. Without adding any sugar, he drank it gradually. He seemed to be  waiting for somebody, who  never came. As ever before, Fei left dorm at 7:20. On the way, two girls were talking  as they were riding bikes in front of Fei. At  the intersection, suddenly another bike appeared like a wind, crashing  into one of the two girls. Without knowing  what happened, the girl fell from the bike and hurt her ankle.  "Oh, sorry, but I will be late for class." The offender hurried away, without  returning. Seeing this, Fei stopped and came to the girl to asked whether she was  OK. Her ankle swelt, Fei decided  to send her to the hospital. The other girl followed. Soon, news of Fei's good deed spread all over, but he was still himself.  One night, It rained when Fei was on his way back to the dorm, and he decided to drink something in the nearby  cafe until it stopped raining.  He ordered a cup of coffee and then opened his book to save the time. Suddenly, Fei felt someone  standing in front of him. "Hi, it's you," A girl's figure came into Fei's eyes as he raised his head.  Fei didn't remember who the girl was until the girl sat down opposite him and the waiter brought her a cup of juice. "You were riding with another girl a few days ago, who was crashed into and whom I sent to the hospital.  You looked more worried than that girl did that day. I remember you." "Yes, I really didn't know what to do at that very moment if it were not  for your help. Thank you." The girl  smiled to Fei. "Not at all." Silence kept for a while. "Do you often read here with a cup of coffee in front of you?" "No," Pointing out of the window, Fei continued, "It's raining." "Ha, we are on the same boat!" The girl raised her voice. Fei felt blushed, because never before was there such a pretty and lovely  girl sitting with him. Fei staring  at his book, without the slightest move of his head. "It's a good place here, romantic. Oh, why don't you drink the coffee?  It's turning cold." Hearing this, Fei put down the book, took up the coffee cup and drank up quickly. "It'll never turn cold," the girl added, "but don't you feel bitter when drinking. You forgot to add sugar." "Really? Oh, sorry, I was just thinking about a maths problem. I was so absorbed that I forgot to ..." "But I have added some for you just now." "... " Fei grinned, He would pay anything he owned if he didn't say anything. [sn1,-] "Sorry, I just had a joke with you. My name is Qi. I think we can be friends." "My name is Fei and ..." "I know that and I also know you are in the Civil Engineering department."  Qi interrupted him. The rain stopped. From then on, they were friends. Qi often turned to Fei for help and being together with Qi, Fei felt happy.  He had a feeling, but never  spoke it out. Day after day, the graduation is coming. Fei couldn't bear the feeling  any more. At last, in the same cafe, at the same table, Qi asked:" I 'll graduate from university tomorrow.  I feel excited. And you?" "I... Me, too." "You called me here just now when I was preparing for tomorrow. What's the matter? You seem unhappy." "No. I just think, we've been friends for two years and I don't know if we will still be friends after graduation." "Sure, we will keep in touch however far we are." "I'd rather not let you be away from me. So I can see you everyday." Fei stared at the coffee. "Me, too. But ... Don't worry. I will keep you in my mind, my old friend." "I mean, I mean we can start ... our ... life. You know I mean we are happy  together  and ..." Breathing deadened the cafe. "Fei, I really thank you. The last two years are the happiest time in my life that I spent together with you. I  look on you as my elder brother, a reliable brother. I mean..." It rained. "I don't want to hurt you... I think you will attend the graduation ceremony  tomorrow and enjoy my  speech." With these words, Qi left the cafe and disappeared in the rain. Fei sat there still. The coffee, Without any sugar added, turned cold. From then on, they never met, no touch between them. Qi's figure often appeared in front of Fei. In the dream, Fei murmured, "Qi, where are you? I'm waiting for you in  the cafe."

I was in great need of money. I owned [wd3,-] Tyson, who was a ferocious usurer,  $3000. He had threatened me that if I  could not return the money in two days, my ears would be the food of his  little fish.   Hooligan as I was, I was ingenious. I borrowed the money to buy necessary  materials and do my little inventions. [cc3,-]  Unfortunately few people appreciated my inventions and I got no money back.  So I was in debt of $3000.   How could I get such a large sum of money during a single day? I had  no expensive properties to sell. All I had  were my inventions. But they could not sell [vp7,-] at a good price. Maybe I should  rob a bank. 'Yes, I will.' Only in this  way could I get so much money at once. I had a gun. I could use it. After  sticking some moustache on my face, I  went out.   After observing several banks, I finally found a suitable one to 'do  my job'. It was not a very large one and few  guards were patrolling there. I went directly to a young service girl.  With a smile on face, she said 'good morning'  to me. But as I put the gun, wrapped in a piece of paper, on the counter,  her smile froze. 'Give me $3000, quickly'. I  could feel my voice trembling. The girl seemed a little calm after a few  seconds. Again smile on face, she asked,  'Would you like it to be in fifty or in ten?' pretending that there was  nothing unusual happening. 'Either will do,  only if quickly'. I was not patient. I kept looking around. Fortunately,  no one noticed me. The job was carried out  smoothly. For a third time, the girl was with a smile. She warped her lips.  I followed subconsciously. All at once, I  found my moustache was loose. I made it up in a hurry and urged in a low  voice, 'Don't snicker, hurry up'. Finally  with a cunning smile on face, the girl passed me the money parcel. I grabbed  it and headed toward the gate.   I ran directly home. As soon as I got home, I locked the door, panting  out of breath. When I calmed down, I  unraveled the parcel to enjoy my harvest. But to my great surprise, there  was nothing but bunches of blank paper.  Oh, my ears, you were doomed to be the food of Tyson's little fish. 					 
 
<ST 4>  <band 6> <title The Cloud above the Battle field> 
Here was no trace of enemy for the moment as far as eye can reach. Everything fell into silence. He, drained and depleted, just lay and watched in the trench. His face was that of a student's with a pair of confused eyes. Under the sky, the mountains stood still. Beside him were the corpses of his companions and his own rifle. He stretched himself out, changed the pose and faced the blue sky. No, not blue, but  gray, the dead gray. The Sun was unsteady, panting and sighing. Suddenly, something in the sky grasped his attention [cc3,-]. It was the single cloud at this very moment, however, curiously shaped, hanging on the edge of the mountains. He looked straightly at the cloud with wide-open eyes. Against the strands of sunlight, the cloud exhibited itself brightly and splendidly. Its color ranged from pure white to faint yellow, gold, orange, and even purple. Suddenly the machine guns and rifles broke the silence of the dawn, like dogs barking on the lonely farms. He reluctantly hauled his eyesight away and looked around. There was no one in the eyeshot - the enemy was under cover. He thought for a while, and then moved his eyes to the cloud again. Now, it sank a little and converted itself into a more capricious shape. He smiled and murmured to it in spite of the louder gunshots. Suddenly, a bullet whistled past his ears just  beside him. He cursed and crawled away to the opposite. However, he still gazed at the cloud, which was almost  unseen, only leaving a small part tantalizing him. Another machine gun ravaged the ground around him with a shower of bullets. Finally, a bullet hit him mercilessly on the head. He died immediately with a vestige of smile beside his mouth and the still opened eyes, fixing on the trace of the cloud. Then it lay still, peacefully.   

<ST 4>  <band 6> <title Pass By, Friendship Stays> 
It was summer. The air-conditioned compartment was stuffy. People hustled about in the aisle, occasionally bumping into each other or murmuring something like "sorry", or "excuse me". As the train started, those who traveled in groups began to chat or  play cards. Those who, like myself, traveled alone either tried to sleep or settled on a book. I also decided to spend the whole night reading; one of the disadvantages of travelling overnight is that there is no chance to appreciate the landscape outside. Unfortunately, I could not concentrate. Maybe I needed a refreshing chat instead, I thought.   Yet around me was only a heated discussion about the stock market -- things that I was ignorant of. 	Somehow the girl sitting opposite attracted my attention. In simple white T-shirt and with a schoolbag, she was apparently a college student. Contrary to the din around, she was immersed in her own book. As she read intensively, an unconscious smile nestled in her crystal-like eyes, indicating hearty appreciation of the contents. I then decided that I might enjoy talking to her; at least we both had a campus experience to share.  	But how could I make a start? I was, by nature, shy and passive. I never [ad1,-] could initiate a conversation with  enough confidence and tact. Reluctantly, I gave up the thought. Then the service boy on the train came along with tea and coffee. I bought a cup of coffee to freshen myself up.  As I sat by the window, however, it was difficult to take the hot stuff  back. A stable hand offered timely help. It was the girl opposite. I thanked her, and then, nudged by something inside, added, "What are you reading about?"   At this [wd4,-] she handed me the book gracefully and replied, "It is one of my  favorite: [sn9,-] novels by contemporary Western  writers.  Oh, by the way, I noticed that you are reading something on aesthetics.  May I have a look at the book, please?"  "Of course." Then, we exchanged the books and began talking about our reading habits.  The initial barrier between strangers was cast off; the chatterbox was opened.  	Or indeed, it was a treasure box that was opened. She was a student of Chinese Literature and I had always cherished an interest [cc3,-] in novels and poems; our topics were abundant.  I listened to her recommendation of masters'  works, remarks on contemporary writers and admiration for her favorite  books and authors. She, in return, got to know my perspective of literary works as an outsider, one whose view is profoundly influenced by "the scientific  way of thinking". This extensive exchange of ideas and thoughts was really wonderful: focuses of the discussions shifted quickly and randomly; new thoughts inspired the mind [cc3,-] constantly.  Like floods rushing over barren land, the hearty conversation nourished an otherwise lonely night. Time flashed by. It was soon dawning. When the first beam of sunlight gilded the tiny tables and soft couches inside, most of the passengers were still fast asleep. We were both staying awake for a whole night, yet it felt like dreaming in a sense. Hours ago we were mere strangers: two individuals that happened to board on the same train. Minutes later we would bid each other farewell, as old friends. We could have passed by without knowing each other, were it not for the girl's helping hand, reaching out further beyond necessity,and for my rather abrupt question, bumping  slightly out of the sphere of conventionality.  Yes, sometimes friendship could be so easy [wd7,-], if one takes the initiative.       


<ST 4>  <band 6> <title Feeling of Death>          
People who have lived an urban life for a long time will find it, sooner or later, a little bit banal. That is why my  friends and I decided to make an adventure in the wild. When we put our  tents, sleeping bags and food into the  waterproof packs, we could not refrain the jollity and no one had expected  the danger ahead. Several guides led us into the mountain, and soon became disappointed  with our incompetence to walk. Now  and then, here and there, there was someone tumbling into the water, or  someone skidding [wd3,-] down the rock. When we arrived at the cataract, it was gloaming, almost two hours later than the guides had planned. [sn2,-] Pain and fatigue,  however, made us too exhausted to  think of its serious consequences.  We had to surmount the cliff beside the cataract. I was dumbfounded by the perpendicular of the crag. There were four shallow concaves on its surface, which was [vp3,-] the only way we could  and must take. The guides demonstrated for [vp2,-] us how to pass it, and gave us some instructions. In order to save time, they didn't let us wear safe-belt[wd2,-], but just pull a rope across the surface of the crag, with its  two ends tied on the trees, which was probably a  fatal mistake.     It was my turn and I plucked up to climb close to it. Like the guide, I first put my fingers into the crevice and one foot into the first concave. Then I cautiously moved the other foot into the same concave and freed the former one to reach the next. Soon the tension in my legs caused me to tremble, and the tremble caused my fear. Precarious on the crag, I was unable to move on. I was soon aware that my strength would run out if no further steps were taken.  So I made a jerk towards the third concave, which cost my balance. My foot slid from the concave terribly, and I was falling to death. Just a split of second, [sn2,-] finding I was still alive, [sn3,-]  my heart resumed beating. The rope below somehow supported me between my waist and the pack and I was pendulous in the air! Night came and appeared grisly. Above me was the darkening sky and some noised [wd2,-] while below me was the  sepulchral abyss and absolute silence. The chilly mountain breeze kept me sober, informing me that I was in the palm of the god [fm3,-]. Time seemed frozen until I heard someone asking for my hand. I followed him and felt pulled upward. The feeling of death was so marvelous that it exorcised all the dread in my heart. The desire for life was so strong that I exerted the rest of my strength to tug up. I was helped to touch the crevice and concave again, and I managed to surmount the last concave and joined my friend in tears. After that moment, all the hardness ahead became nothing to me. Wading in the water, plodding on the gravel -- all was nothing. The feeling of death had become an impetus to me.  Even now, having returned to the urban life, [sn3,-] that feeling remains intact  in my memory. I don't take it as a nightmare, but rather a nice dream, reminding me the significance of life and endowing me with strength to strive out of every predicament.       

<ST 4>  <band 6> <title The Impeachment>     
When I was in high school, I was in the advanced class. Famous for our naughtiness and haughtiness, the class was nicknamed 'the Devil Club'. However, the name made us feel different and we always enjoyed being the little devils of the school. But maybe Mr. Felton had made an exception.  Mr. Felton was our physics teacher in Senior 2. He was a man of 40 and always smiling. But soon we found that his teaching was very poor: what he taught was either simple or wrong.  Many of my classmates expressed their discontent to Ms. Stewart, who was in charge of our class, but the reply was always the same: we were just not  adapted to Felton's way of teaching. However, the more I tried to enjoy his lessons, the more I felt him a nuisance.  Even his smiling looked silly and disgusting. Greatly annoyed, Mark and I wrote articles about it and sent one copy to the Principal. We even had a talk with his eminence yet without any  effect. Disappointed and irritated, we knew what the last thing we could do was.     With the thought of revenge, we welcomed the annual poll on teachers' teaching qualities. Most of us marked Felton with 'D' (the worst level) in every item. We even instigated many students in other classes to give him a poor grading. Only by this means, we thought, could we express our  dissatisfaction. As the new semester of Senior 3 was coming, we prayed day by day to have  a new physics teacher so as to get rid of  Felton. Yet far beyond my expectation, I was told that he was fired! I  felt a bit sorry for him. Had he not been  assigned to the advanced class, had he not met such devils as we were,  such things would never have happened. A year later, news came that he  had got cerebral haemorrhage and become paralyzed. It was too late to say  we didn't  mean it. But maybe after such experience, we could know how to treat people  even when they were wrong.
