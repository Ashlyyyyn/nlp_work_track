From a survey, former college students have little ability to adapt to our society. So they have contributed less to the society than expected. In order to know the world outside the campus, there are many means by which we can practise. The most important one is through mass media. For example, we can know about the incidents which have happened in the world and issues through newspapers and televisions. So that our thoughts can keep the step with the development of our society. Besides, we can know about the world around us through our services to the society. In this way, we will touch all kinds of people and we will have more experience. All these will lay a good foundation after we graduate from school. To know more information about the world, I think I should form the good habbit of reading newspapers and watching programs of news on TV. At the same time, I will be more active in committee services. And put the knowledge I've learned from books into practice. I think only in this way can I be more useful to our society."

When it was in 1960, in developing countries, the infant mortaility was 200 deaths per 1000 births; but it has dropped down to 100 deaths per 1000 births in 1990. What lead to these chances ? I think, the important reason is the income of people in the developing countries has raised in 30 years. their structure of consume has changed. the level of people's life rised . on the other hand, all kinds of books on how to live and the progresses of the TV or radio on living in correcting way give people many useful construction .

Secondly, the living level has been increased much in the past thirty years. In 1960, the life was very hard for people, they seldom had meat to eat, or other good food to eat, so many people died when they were very young. while today people in developing countries have many more nutrious foods to eat.

That's to say, only through practice can we accomplish our work to an excellent degree. For example, when we learn English we must remember lots of words. During the course, we do many exercises and sometimes we also have tests. These were period we make \"practice\". After practice we can speak and use English freely. We can also write something in English. So we can master English through practice. For anothe example, we play games. At first we know nothing about the games, but through practice, we can play the games well. So we can say \"Practice makes perfect\" is a truth saying."

For example, during learning English, when you read a new word, you will look up in the dictionary and know the meaning. But you don't use it again and again, you will forget it. For example, you learn to make a planet-model . At first, you make a planet-model according to the teacher's advice. When you make it at two times , the second model will be nicer than the first model. Thus the planet-model will be made nicer and nicer. The saying \"Practice Makes Perfect\" is known to us.

In the recent years, population has been increasing rapidly. All of human beings need water to drink; Modern industry develops with high speed. It is necessary to have enough water to drive machines; Furthermore, a great deal of water is polluted and it is unfit for us to drink. All these factors result in the shortage of fresh water.

This problem may be explained clearly by life expectancy and infant mortality. In 1960 the life expectancy in developing countries is forty years old and it is sixty years old in 1990. As well as it , in 1960 the infant mortaility is 200 deaths per 1,000 births, while in 1990 it drops to 100 deaths per 1,000 births. The reasons of these changes is mainly about the developments of the economy and the service of hospital.

In fact, at present, the problem of global shortage of fresh water become heavier and heavier . With the increasing of the population, the increasing of the demand for the water for industry, many people realized our world is short of fresh water. The fresh water which we had today can't satisfied all the demand of our society, and at the same time, the problem of water polution is very seciously , and this destroyed the quality of the fresh water. Today, global shortage of fresh water already become a problem that must be solved as quickly as possible. To solve the problem, first, we must do our best to make good use of every drip of the fresh water. Second, we must control the increasing of the population. After doing that we can reduce the demand for fresh water. We must solve the problem of water population and we can discover the new resource of fresh water with our science knowledge. Maybe, in future we can get the fresh water from the sea and at that time the fresh water can be really abundant."

If someone oppose to it, they'll say that there is so much water, in river, in dam, in well , even in iceburg , so we never worry about the shortage of fresh water. In fact, fresh water source is very limited. First, with the increasement of gloral population the average water-consumption has greatly reduced insttan . Secondly, in the 20th century, gloral industry has greatly advanced, with the problem that water consumption has increased. At last , more and more serious pollution has increased the contradiction between water source and consumption. Facing such serious problem, what should we do? On the one hand, we must save water and tell our children to do so. On the other hand, we must prevent water source from pollution. Finally, we should develop the technology which can convert sea water to fresh water. We should try our best to prevent global shortage of fresh water."

But compared with the fresh water we use, these aren't plentiful. In fact, the fresh water is very short now. First, population is increasing quickly. So we need more fresh water. Second, the fresh water that industry needs also increases with the development of industry. Finally, because of the development of industry, the pollution of fresh water is making another serious problem. Now, you know we are facing with the global shortage of fresh water indeed. In order to overcome it, we must save up the quantity we use. If every one of us takes action, we must be able to overcome it."

But I have to say that it isn't necessarily the case. In fact, we are seriously shortage of fresh water. One reason is the increasing of population and industry. Our population has approached to 1. 2 billion and it is also on the rise, but the resource of fresh water doesn't increase at all. Furthermore, with the development of modern industry, the requirments of fresh water are amusing . The other reason is pollution. We all know that factories make a lot of polluted water which is sent to revers and makes it unfit to drink. What's more, trees are cut down and the recycling of water is distroyed . Then what can we do to deal with it? First is to save . Reduce the ammont of fresh water for everyday life. Second is to protect the resource of fresh water by planting trees. Finally, we should do our best to develop the technology of deriving fresh water from sea water."

Therefore, getting to know the world outside the campus is very essentinal to each college student. But how can we get to know the outside world? First, on the campus, we can read newspapers, magazines and some certain books; we can listen to the news on the radio and so on. Second, I think it is more important to watch TV, because through watching TV we can be informed of the current situation and the latest news in good time so as to enlarge our singht field.
