For another, with the development of the socioty  , the industry has improved greatly. And as a result, factories need more fresh water than before. Finally, and what  is the worst, the water pollution is becoming serious and serious. As it is know  , more and more fresh water is wasted or converted to durty  water every day. What should we do to solve this problem? Fresh water is never too much for us all to use, so we must protect fresh water source. First of all, we all should be educated  to realize that fresh water is very important to us and it is now in global shortage. We should be conscious of saving fresh water. On the other hand, we should try our best to improve the method of converting sea water into fresh water, so that the sea water can be made good use of. In general, we should save our fresh water and improve our fresh water to solve this problem.

And with the development of modern industry, A  great deal of water is used in industry. Meanwhile, the water pollution makes the water available less. What shall we do? I think, first, we must must  use the water with more cares and mustn't waste water. Second we must protect the water sources from being polluted. Third we must find new sources of fresh water such as turning sea-water  into fresh water. Only in these ways can we solve the problem of fresh water shortage.

Firstly there is  more and more people today, so we need more fresh water, but fresh water can not increase just as the increasing  of the population.  Furthermore, fresh water is less than before now, for more fresh water is used by factories, and a lot of fresh water is polluted, for instance, the water in Xingjian is not fit for drinking now.  We have to drink fresh water and we have to develop indusitry  . So we must do something for ourselves. We ought to use as little as  we can, do not waste a drop of water.  We ought to make people know the global shortage of fresh water,  We must prevent the factories from polluting the water.

First, the population is rising so quickly that the used fresh water  increases. Secondly, the industrial water increases. Thirdly, in many countries, fresh water has been badly polluted with dangerous chemicals. If we want to have a bright future, we must take measures now. In fact, we can pass many new laws to clean the water, and to control the rapid increase of the population in the world. It is also important for us to be enconomical  of water.

So many people believe that the fresh water is never to be used out, and they can get it whenever they want. Actually, the fresh water in our globe is in shortage. With the growing  of the population and the industries, more and more fresh water is required to keep up with the steps of the development. The resource of water is limited, the more used, the less left.  But many people haven't realized it yet. They wastes  water in large quatity  and purse  the polluted water into the rivers, and as a result, we take the water out from the river to drink.  In many countries, the shortage of fresh water is very serious, and it must depend on the water supply from other countries. In concludsion  we can learn that we men  must take a serious look on  the shortage of fresh water and try our best to stop wasting and polluting water. Many scientists are thinking of ways to use the ice on  top of the mountains, but that's not a solution, in  the most important, all people on our earth should do our best to protect our fresh water.

In fact, we are short of fresh water. With the increase of population the fresh water is becoming more and more important. The factory need more and more fresh water to improve the number of their products. In addition, a lot of fresh water is polluted so the fresh water is less. We should take measure  to protect our fresh water, in case it is polluted more seriously. We should control the development of the population.

It  is no sense worring  about the shortage of fresh water. Is it true that fresh water can't be used up? Of course the answer is certainly negation  . In fact, the fresh water  is limited and even short of. With the development of the society, the global  is facing with the problem of larger number of population and of promotting  development of industry and agriculture. The living use, industrial use and other use of fresh water is increasing at a high speed. Second, with the development of industry, the pollution problem has been brought out. The waste water has been sent to the rivers so that the polluted water in the river is unfit to drink or use. Fresh water becomes less and less, in  the same time the demands for fresh water are larger and larger, so the shortage of fresh water forms  .  What  can we solve this problem? First, I think, is to educate people to use fresh water economically. Families and factories should not waste water. Second, scientists should come up with ways to develop the reusing  of fresh water. Last  , countries should make  measure to protect the oceans, rivers, to prevent them from being polluted.

First, an increase in population makes the shortage of fresh water available. Second, rapidly advancing industry takes up quite a considerable proportion of fresh water in use. Third, water pollution leads to the fact that much water is greatly polluted and they can no more  be used. Measures must be taken to "save" fresh water. Laws should be put into effect.

First, with the population's increasing  the fresh water consumpation  is increasing. Second, the fresh water which is used in industry is also increasing. Finally, the water pollution make  the fresh water become less and less. So we must realize  the problem and try our best to solve it. And how  should we do to solve the problem? We must take some measures to decrease the waste of fresh water. For example, we could apply the law to confine the increasing  of population, water consumpation  of industry and prevent the fresh water from polluting  .

The ideas of those people are utterly wrong. In fact fresh water is scarce. At present, the supply of fresh water can't meet people's needs. The increasing  of our population led to much more needs of fresh water than before. And fresh water used for industrial productive  is also increasing. The most terrible problem is that a lot of water has been polluted seriously. So the problem of the shortage of fresh water becomes more and more noticeable. What should we do now? First, everyone should save every drop of water and make use of fresh water effectively. Second, we ought to decrease the pollution of water and protect our fresh water resource.

The population increase  quickly, and the indistry  of nations is encouraged to develope  faster and faster. So  , as a result, more and more fresh water is requied  . What's more, the pollution problem is becoming more seriouse  . Now we have to face the terrible shortage of water. How  can we do to fight against the shortage of fresh water. At  first, we should try to make everyone know the importance of water-saving  . Sencondly  , we should properly limite  the use of fresh water in people's daily life. The third, also is  the most important, is to improve our technology, So  that factories can reduce the demanding  of fresh  , and can put fresh water into recycle  .

They all use a large amount of fresh water. Third, in these days, many  fresh water has been polluted. Of course, there are other factors leading to the global shortage of fresh water. In order to solve the problem of shortage of fresh water, I think we should take the following steps: First, we should improve our science and find a solution to use other kind  of water, for example, sea water. Second, we should try our best to save fresh water. We should make good and fully  use of every drop fresh water.

On the contrary, the problem of global shortage of fresh water is serious. First, the population has been rapidly increasing since  this century. It leads to the decreasement  of the average  water which one owns. Second, by the increasement  of industrial water, the fresh water decreases faster. Third, the polution  is geting  worse and worse, which make  the shortage of fresh water more serious. In spite of these problems, we can solve the shortage as long as we make efforts.

First, Pop Music is easy to accept  for its melody and words, while Folk Music is a bit too abstract. Second, Pop Music is easy for people to learn to sing, but Folk Music is quite difficult for usual  people to sing, for there are too many skills. Third, the  Pop Music singers are mostly  the youth  and they are very modern on  their clothes, this will be oppreciated  .  But Folk Music singers are usually in uniformed suit and not so easy going,  Perhaps this will make a little gap between the singers and the audience. To me, in my spare time I will listen rather  to pop  music  than to  Folk Music. While in  somewhere and sometimes I am also very willing to listen to Folk Music, such as a party or a concert. I think both Pop Music and Folk Music are very beautiful  . We can  live without it. We can't choose Pop but throw away the Folk or choose the Folk throw away the Pop.

For instance, maybe Zhang Hai-di is just a handicap's idol. Her action must  give the handicap  a direction of life. She can make the man feel hopeful and full of strength and encourage the man for ever. In a word, proper idols are very important for all of the people.
