<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GDUFS>, <AGE ?>, <WAY ?>, <DIC ?>, <TYP 2>My Education Although I was very young, I showed great interests in studies and used to urge my father to teach me read and write before I receiving the school education.[sn8,s] At that time, I enjoyed leaning [wd3,s] so much that I had [vp6,s-] formed a good habit of hard-working since then. I went to primary school at the age of 7, and left it at 13 after successfully passing the entrance examination to junior Middle School. It took me 3 years to finish the junior secondary education. I didn't do a good job at the entrance examination to senior Middle School and nearly lost the opportunity of being a student of the key school. Because of the failure, I studied much harder than before and finally managed to be an excellent student. After graduation in 1991, while I was 19 years old, I took part in the national university entrance examination. I felt worried and anxious while waiting for the results. At last, I was lucky enough to pass the examination and became an English major of Guangzhou Institute of Forieign [fm1,-] languages. The Sacred Tree Long long ago, there was a fig tree regarded as sacred at Thika, in Kenya. Shortly before Kenya gained her independence, it was seriously struck by lightning in a stormy night and began to wither rapidly. The news encouraged people very much, because it fulfilled the prophecy made by kibiru, a famous prophet of the kikuyu tribes. What's more, it was said in the prophecy that the death of the tree will bring life to [np6, -2] new country. Visitors with excitement from all parts of the country gathered around the sacred tree. At last, it decayed completely just by the day Kenya offically [fm1,-] became independent. A new country was born. Nowdays [fm1,-]. [sn9, s] Around [fm3, 1-] the place the tree stood [wd4, s] a high wall made by colonist still remained. It had been a symbol of opress [fm1,-] but now it can do nothing to the independent Kenya. The Record-Holder A boy made himself well-known in England by travelling 1600 miles while playing truant. In other words, he had set up a record for the thousands of boys who dream of evading school. He reached Perpignan on the French-Spanish border at last and sent back to England by the local authorities. His parents who were so worried met him at the harbour and saw their dear son returning with sick, cold and hungry look. As soon as they met, the parents hugged the child tightly bursting into tears.[sn8,s]The boy's schoolmates lined [vp1, 1-2] the roads to give the boy a hero's welcome. Cheering him to school. But the boy himself was afraid of being punished. He was right. The headmaster who were [vp3, 4-] so angry made him give a talk to the whole school about his experiences abroad. [sn8,s]Actually. [sn9, s] The [fm3, 1-] children were very pround [fm1,-] of their little hero. He Became [fm3, 1-] the admiration of everyone. The Watch While I was in Junior 3, in 1988, my grand-parents who had been living in Taiwan Since 1949 were allowed to come to mainland to visit their relatives. It was really an exciting news for my family, for our reunion.[sn8,s] As their yougest [fm1,-] grand-daughter. [sn9, s] I was given a gift which was a delicate watch. It was so elegant on the wrist, and furthermore, so expensive that I always wear it with the covering of the cuff. One day, at school, suddenly, I was astonished to find that the watch had disappeared. I looked around and went back to the places where I had been just now but found nothing at all. It seemed that I would never see my watch again. While thinking of that, I blamed myself for my carelessness. I just didn't want to believe that I had lost it. It was so important a present given by my dear grandparents. All the morning, I sat there listless, disappointed and sad. Suddenly, there was a boy who were [vp3, 3-] shouting with something sparkle [wd2, 1-] in his hand:" whose [fm3, 1-] watch?" I rushed to him and excited to find that it was just my watch![sn8,s] The rest of the day I was full of joy. Until I got home did I realize that I had forgotten to express my appreciation to the boy. Escape It was a dark night. A prisoner of war had just escaped from the camp. Working very rapidly and carefully in the darkness, he was soon dressed himself as a guard in a blue uniform. At this moment, shouting in the camp was heard and people there were thrown into confusion. The prisoner was still in the camp, calm and cautious. He wormed his way into the crowd and pretended to be in search for the "missing" prisoner. Of course there wouldn't be any results. It was believed that the man had left the camp. Several groups of guards rushed out in a lorry. The prisoner quickly joined them. They were carried into the countryside where there was a forest streching [fm1,-] for miles. They went into the forest and scattered. The prisoner, who was so lucky to meet this golden opportunity, ran away as quickly as he could and soon disappeared. The Thief When I was a primary school pupil, one afternoon, I went to the book shop with a friend, with a ten-yuan note in the pocket of my trousers. I always put my hand right on the pocket so that I would know the money was safe there. The book shop was full of people who were busy looking for their favorite books. It took us quite a long time to be close to the counter. My hands were busy, so it was impossible for me to take care of the money. Suddenly, Noticed someone approached me in a very different way. [sn2,s]I took a glance at the person and found that he was a schoolboy, a little older and taller than me. He appeared to be looking for books. But his eyes told me he was nervous. At this very moment, he began to walk slowly in another direction. An idea occurred to me that there might be something wrong. I felt my pocket at once but found nothing. I gave a cry and saw the boy running towards the gate. He must be the thief and no mistake! My friend rushed to him without hesitation and seized him by the collar. The thief was so frightened that a ten-yuan note clenched in his first fell off. When we picked up the mote, he rapidly ran away and disappeared. A false [fm3, 1-] Alarm At first, my wife did not recognize me. Being in a drowse, she was astonished to find such a "stranger" climbing up to her window. At the same time, she saw the policeman then immediately gave a loud cry: "Oh, Sir, help! The thief!" "Yes, madam,!" [sn8,s] The policeman quicken [vp6,s-] his steps towards me without hesitation. I was so flurried that I climbed much more slowly than I expected. At last, he seized my left foot and pulled me down the ladder. In fact, his action was so sudden that I fell off the ground, giving a cry because of the sharp pain. Recognizing my tone, my wife realized her mistake and came to us at once. The policeman was seizing my collar at that time, holding up his head, full of sense of pride, like a hero. But, he was disappointed to hear not appreciation but explaination [fm1,-], and apology, "Well, madam, I'm awfully sorry" he said. Before leaving, he stared at me and spoke in a low voice:" Go on cleaning your window, sir. You enjoy doing that at night."Feb 22 1993Dear Min,Haven't seen you for a long time. How are you there [fm1,-] days? I'm sorry you can't come up to Guangzhou to take part in my birthday party. Days seemed to me so empty without you. I really had a good time in the winter vacation. The only awful thing was that it was rather cold during the Spring Festival. Can you imagine, only 3C! I was almost waiting for snowing and hardly ever went out. Fortunately, there were lots of friends visiting us, which made me feel less lonely. Besides, I could enjoy large number of wonderful TV and radio programmes. Later, as it was getting warmer and warmer, I became busy in doing housework. Endless washing, cooking and shopping made up my routine life. Althrough [fm1,-] it was exhaustible, it also gave me a sound sleep every night and made me feel happy all the time.By the way, throw [wd7, 1-] the year of 1993, fireworks are not allowed to be let off in Guangzhou. So for the first time, we had experienced a quiet New Year's eve. Such a comfortable night would be unforgettable. Hope to hear from you soon.

It has been proved that smoking can cause serious lung disease, pullute [fm1,-] air and therefore do harm to the secondhand-smokers. We'll be on the verge of self-destroying, effective action should be taken against smoking without any hesitation. Firstly, cigarratte [fm1,-] sales should be limited under strict laws. Secondly, any advertisement concerned with smoking should be forbidden to [wd5, 1-]on TV, radio, newspaper and posters. Thirdly, also the most important step is to educate people not to smoking through school education and mess media.Since some people so far have not pay enough attention to the harmness [fm2, 1-] caused by smoking, and some of them even have met had the idea, the public must try their best to save heavy smoker from smoking, to prevent people from beginning to smoke. [sn8,s]We're responsible for our health and our environment. Therefore, everyone is expected to be involved in the campaign against smoking. Voice your support and take measures! On hearing the sound of an explosion, I looked up in alarm. A huge rock was bounding down the hill, towards me. It seemed to keep coming straight for me although I had jumped to another rock. Seeing that, I wedged myself into a narrow space nearby. Almost at the same moment, the mass of rock struck the ground then came to rest, just a few feet away. [sn8,s]Knowing that it might be the queen bee hidden in his car that attracted groups of bees following, the man drove away as fast as he could to escape. Later, he parked the car outside a hotel. But soon it was found to be covered with bees. The man asked the police for help. A bee-keeper was sent to take the bees home in a box. The man finally drove away in peace.

A Close Friend Richard is one of [wd4, s]close friends with a dark complexion and large, bright eyes. His face looks built for smiling,, always cheerful and friendly. Pretty tall, he can be easy spotted among the boys. Playing chess is one area where he knows he can excel, communicating is another . Richard has an elephant's memory for appearances and names. It brings him into close contact with a lot of friends. While walking with him on the streets in downtown, you won't find it inordinary [fm2, 1-] to see him greeting his friends one and another. Just two hours, the list can be added up to ten persons. Calm, humourous [fm1,-] and full of creative ideas, he is a wonderful performer in whatever situation, and, the more difficult the more successful. Once he was suddenly asked to give a mini-lecture to hundreds of people. As soon as he stood before the andience [fm1,-], a ray of intelligence bursted [fm1,-] upon his face. After his eyes wandered around the room for a while he began:" I would like to read you a poem." Then he paused for [np8,-1] few seconds, when audience regarded him with troubled looks. Suddenly, he raise [vp6,s-] his eyebrows:" Ah! Life! That's all. Thank you." When the audience understood what had happened, they couldn't help laughing heartily and giving him warm applause.My Dear JaneMike sat down alone, his supper uneaten, staring into space, while tears filled his eyes. Only a week ago did he lose both [wd1, 1-] his legs in that terrible accident. Jane didn't appear since then. "She had loved me, " he believed, " but at that time I was healthy and strong. All is over , now----- no future, no love. " Paler sunlight flooded the room, but the mood was somber. Suddenly a girl came in. Beautiful and sweet, she could be easily recognized at first sight :" Oh, Jane, dear, I had thought you would leave me alone!"She said nothing, but came nearer, holding his hands. Tears flooded her blue eyes.The following days, Jane came to Mike's room every day, every day with beautiful followers and sweet smile. The only thing she seemed different was that she was no longer talkative.One day, she didn't come, but came a post which was an invitation card to JANE's wedding ceremony. Mike felt dizzy.The next day. [sn9, s] Mike walk [vp6,s-] up to see Jane sitting beside his bed 'You---- get out!"A pause ensued. "I'm awfully sorry, Mike. But please, please, forgive my sister. She didn't intend to hurt you."Mike was started to hear that." Who are you? You are not Jane?""I'm Jane's sister Mary. We are twins." "......*..""Please, forgive her.""......*." "I love you, Mike.""------ Mary, ......." He embraced her, smiling with tears.Now, I am sitting at the round table covered with red cloth. In the middle of the table, beautiful roses are placed in an exquisite vase. Their attractive red color hoes with the cloth, refershing [fm1,-] your eyes. Near the edge of the table, there are five sets of table-wares [fm1,-] for individual use. Each one consists of a glass, a cup, a small plate, a spoon and a pair of chopsticks.Around the flowers, three delicious dishes are placed to form a circle. The soup is in a big bowl with a few slices of yolk floating on it, like yellow flowers. Next to it, on its right hand side, a fried fish is lying quietly in a fish-shaped plate, oil slightly flowing on its golden surface, garlic put to enhance its color and taste. The last dish is on the left hand side of the soup. Black mushrooms steeped in soy sauce are put to form a circle on the outside part of the plate. Inside the circle, there are pieces of chicken in wine placed to form the shape of a chick. The head, the wings, the legs and so on, all kept well and on their original places, vivid and attractive.The room is in a mess. You find a broken rug lying on the smooth wooden floor. In front of the rug, on the area it doesn't cover, stands a cane armchair of old-fashioned style. Its back against the wall on which a piece of paper is pasted. On your left hand-side, a broom is placed upside down, against the wall with no decorations. Above the broom, several pieces of wood boards of irregular shape was stucked [fm1,-] on the wall for mending. On the upper part of the wall, there are two attractive colorful posters. The left one shows you the portrait of two women bachelors dressed in black growns [fm1,-], arm in arm, certificates in hands, looking in distance with sweet smile. They are standing on the earth. Next to this picture, with the edge carefully folded on that of the left one, there is anther poster for" Coca Cola". An cheerful old man dressed like a Santa Claus is raising a bottle full of Cola with his right hand. Just beside him, there is an enlarged photo of a bottle of this drink. A wooden board shaped like a road sign is put on the two pictures, covering a few [np8, 1-] part of the frame.Far away from the bustling, Gary Cooper was walking alone on the street somewhere in the western America. There were few people, few horses and few houses, except Mr Cooper's figure and his shadow, long, slim, moving slowly forward.He was wearing a black waistcoat with a white long-sleeve shirt inside, so neat, so clean. The black bow-tie on his collar, the star-shaped badge and watch-chain on his waistcoat were all shinning in that bright sunshine. His black trousers looked baggy, with a pair of black leather shoes to go for. His hands hung down loosely, with his right hand slightly touching the holster. Under his black hat, there was a shireled [fm1,-] face. It seemed to be plundged [fm1,-] deep into thought with deep eyes. Teeth clentched [fm1,-], lips tightly closed, he did inspire confidence and calmness.His steps were heavy and steady. His body  straighten.[sn2,s] There was something vaguely alert about him.The city was just awaken from its sound sleep. The King Street was enjoying the lazy and tender winter sunshine. A man wearing glassed [fm1,-], together with his two young daughters [sn9, s]was slouching on the street. Finally, his step rested upon No.27.and he came into this dark and cold corner. Here, between the high walls made of bricks, there was a high iron gate. A severe wire screen was closely behind it. It was the gate of a firm which had closed down recently. The man was standing in front of the gate leaning slightly forward, looking though the gate carefully [sn9, s] anxiously, and sadly. He was in his late thirties, dressed in a shabby coat and a baggy pair of trousers, with a dirty face and dishevelled [fm1,-] hair. His nose nearly touched the bar of the gate. He put the younger girl on his shoulder. She was probably only a [wd5, 1-] two years old, too young to understand what had happened. She sat there, eyes half-closed, in a kind of dream. The elder daughter was left alone, standing next to her father. Her hands was tightly holding the bars. She did know here was things to see, things to recall, in this infinite darkness behind the gate. [sn8,s]But she saw nothing. Mother was there. Mother would not come back again. However, it was the place which [sn7, s] father led her around every days[np6,-]. Maybe mother would appear someday, she believed, looking hopefully. The man kept silent. He had [vp6, -1] saw, through the darkness, his happy family, his beloved wife [sn9, a] his prosperious [fm1,-] firm, in the past. There was sudden a smile on his face. Almost at the same time, he lapsed into melancholy again.When class is over, it is almost 12 o'clock at noon. Simply stuffing the books into my bag, I rush to the dormitory. With an empty stomach, I continuely [fm1,-] quiken [fm1,-]my steps. As soon as I enter into my room, I drop the bag on the chair, grab the lunch-box, and serval [fm1,-1] coupans. As quick as the wind, I'm already on the way to the dining-room. The crowd flocking to that same destination is like an army marching forward without hesitation. Here I am, among hundreds of people all eager to eat. Waiting impatiently in the lone [fm1,-] line, I am pushed heavily to and fro by the students behind. I rapidly join another crowd after fetching the rice. In front of the windows where vegetable and meat are being serve [vp7, 1-] there are so many people that I am justled [fm1,-] against now and then. Finally, I contrive to be the one of the nearest people to the window. Stretching out my hand as long as possible, with mouth murmuring:" Chicken! Chicken!" At last, I get a ladle of meat. Now it seems very difficult for me to get out of the queue. Raising the box high over my head. [sn9, s] I wedge my way out with strength. Sometimes I have to stand on tip toe. While leaving the dining-room, I feel got in the cold winter wind.Burdened with three pieces of heavy baggage. [sn9, s] I embarked on my journey from Guilin to Guangzhou. It was one of the hottest day of that summer. Once entered into the railway station that was in chaos, I lost sight of friends coming to see me off [sn9, s] A hubbub of voices rose one after another. I felt dizzy and tired. Although it was half an hour to the departure time, passengers who were to go to Guangzhou anxiously pushed forward. They were so violent that some of the children fell down in the line. Things did become comfortable after every one found his seat. The train began to move. Attendants were busy in serving dinner from compartments [np3, s-] to compartments. When the train arrived at Hengyang at early morning, passengers were waken up by a sudden noise. In that distant [wd7, 1-], thousands of people dressed in wretched clothes rushed in. Men were string [wd7, 1-], bringing with them a lot of baggage, women appeared weak and helpless, embracing their children or bags tightly. They occupied every [cc4, 1-1]space that could be found in every compartment. They huddled together, stood on tip toe, men shouting, women moaning, children crying. A quiet might [fm1,-] had became a trageic [fm1,-] scene. I was forced to shank back, breathing very hard at the ever increasing tempreture [fm1,-], dripping with perspiration. Suddenly there came a scream of a lady who sat beside a window. A young man with dark complexion was wedging his body in through the half-opened window. First the feet, the body, then the head. He looked dirty and fierce. No one dared to prevent his entering. At last he just sat on the desk with a cheerful appearance. The rest of the journey looked like a nightmare. I was exhausted when the train finally reached its destination. Holding the baggage carefully, I joined another struggle for getting on the bus.I've definitely made up my mind to work in Guangzhou. The reason is that Guangzhou provides you more opportunities to prove your value. It is much easier for you to lead a comfortable life.A cousin of mine, a merchant who deal [vp3, 3-] with computer business, spent most of his time in Guangzhou. Here, he received all kinds of information quickly and easily, established business relations with business men from Hong Kong, Taiwan, America and other countries . He certainly benefited from geographial [fm1,-] advantages, and made his fortune successfully. Relatively [ad1, 1-], the transportation between Guangzhou and the outside world was convinient [fm1,-], so he managed to enlarge his business by travelling [fm1,-]throughout the country, sometimes, to the over-sea areas. "Guangzhou, as a city full of changes, and latest things, " he told me, " pushes you to create, to make progress. " As for profession, an office position seems attractive to me. Actually, I'm not sure what specific occupation I'll choose. But, I've decided that I won't work as a teacher. Nowadays, in China------ although they are respectable----- [sn2, s] tend to live a harder. [sn9, s] Less [fm3, 1-] comfortable life. Mr Lee was a professor teaching in a university. For years he worked perseveringly. Besides regular lessons, he went to teach in the evening school to earn more money. Unfortunately, he was in poor health. At the end of last year, he fell ill and was sent to the hospital. With his almost insignifant [fm1,-] income, he could hardly pay the fees. The university wouldn't cover the expensive medicines. For example, there was such a kind of this [wd5, 1-] medicine costing 400 yuan each. It was equal to half of his monthly salary. Instead of going by bus, his wife walked a long way everyday to visit him to save money. With two children to support, his family was really [vp7, -1] faced with financial problems.Mar 14. 1994.Sir, To tell you the truth, your terrible singing is much worse than a crow's shouting. You'd better shut your goddamn mouth as soon as possible!Three months eariler [fm1,-], your arrival began to spoil my sweet dreams. Your breaking sound of the bowls and plates, your pounding at the nails, your treading on the floor, your pulling of the furniture*.. Day in, day out, all those disgusting noise filled my ears, harmed my ears, and was going to make me go mad! None [wd7, 1-] I have no dream at all. Every night, you throw your second boot three or five minutes later than the first one. I just sit in the bed waiting for your heavy throwing. Your alarming clock, blast it, calls at 3 o'clock before dawn. The tap water drips all through the might [fm1,-]. There were a lot of parties, quarreling at irregular time. I was exposed to a world without silence for one moment!How annoying to be your neighbor. [sn2,s]I feel vexed, angry all the time. I toss and turn in bed very [cc4, 1-1] night, unable to sleep. Don't think I'm to take refuge in silence, foolish fellow, I'm here to warn you: Behave yourself! I'm tired of just complaining by letters. You are to be held responsible for my loss. Wait and see! Try to ignore that, stupid guy! Be careful your attitude cause any disaster. [sn8,s]By the way, remind you that is something called "court summons" in the world. A man Boiled With Anger Cities I Have Visited Cities I have visited can be divided into two groups. One is for those cities featuring a modern color. The other is for those cities which are old-fashioned. Modern cities exposes [vp3, 1-] you to an environment full of advanced inventions of mankind. In cities like HongKong, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai, sky scrapers and huge buildings stand in great numbers. Streets are crowded with taxies, cars and double-decker [fm1,-]-buses, shops are with customers in smart dress and abundant commodities. In their most [aj3, 1-1] busiest business center, the sky seems to be densely covered by colorful, eye catching sign-boards overhead. You find the name of night clubs, of bands, of well-known companies on the boards. They remain shining until mid-night. Statues and parks are built to dot the city, flowers and trees are planted to enhame [fm1,-] the beauty. A touch of artifical [fm1,-] greatness fills the air. Such a city fresh [vp3, 1-] your eyes. Old-fashioned cities, such as Guilin and Xi'an, have less [np8, s-] high buildings and architectures of modern style. However, they have more historical sites and scenic spots that are not affected by modern man. The splendid palases [fm1,-], the beautiful mountains and waters, the mysterious caves are their attractions. Such natural beauties without polution [fm1,-] lead you to a state of comfort and romance. Such a city fresh [vp3, 1-] your mind. South China Scientific and Technological University (Abbv SESTU ), is as famous as the Guangzhou Institute of Foreign Languages (Abbv GIGL) in Guangzhou. However, in terms of scenery of the campus, they vary in many aspects.The SCSTU covers much larger areas that [fm1,-] GIFL. For the [wd3, 1-] reason, SCSTU impressed [vp6,s-] you as tremendous and grand. In contrast, GIFI appears elaborate and small. The path in SCSTU is wide enough for two vehicles to drive abreast. However, like a stream but exquisite like a poem, giving you a touch of romance. [sn2,s]Students on campus are kind of" scenery". More boys walking on the campus in SCSTU than these in GIFL. Girls in GIFL are of great numbers. They seem to be smarter and more attractive. SCSTU is just like a brother with broad shoulder and great strength, while GIFL is like a sister with slim feagure [fm1,-] and elegant temperament. In GIFL, English majors are required to have a course called Communicative English for Chinese Learners in their first and second year. It is a textbook arranged according to various topics, focusing on the improvement of students listening and speaking ability. To begin a new chapter, the teacher gives a brief introduction of the topic first. Then, he usually gives a dictation as the warmming-up [fm1,-] exercise. He reads to his students a short passage concerning about the topic for three times. The first and the third time at normal speed, the second time with pause. [sn2,s]Students are expected to note down every word exactly at the second reading. After that, the teacher asks the class to put on their earphones. Then he plays the tape. It is about some conversations or monologues spoken by native speakers. Students are asked to grasp the gist at first listening, write down some details the second. Finally, the teacher will [vp6,s-1]raises several questions for the class to answer. The following step will be reading training. Five or six [wd4, s] materials are printed in the book. The teacher's duty is to organize the class to look through all of them in limited time. If there are any difficult language problems involved, he is expected to explain. So far the students have got a lot of ideas of the topic. The first period of the class ends. During the second period, the teacher may speak as little as he can. His concentration shifts to the guiding of his students' using of the knowledge. In order to achieve such a purpose, he chooses a subject or describes a situation first, then divides the class into hold [wd5, 1-1]a discussion groups. Students are expected to prepare for a dialogue, an individual speech, a debate or an interpretation activity. When they are ready, the teacher asks some of them to give their presentation or performance. At that time, he is responsible for invigorating the atmosphere of the class. He welcomes the audience's comments and gives his own, too. Before he calls it a day, he assign [vp3, 1-] to the class a writing task, usually a letter to the friend concerning the subject matter. At last, class is over in a quite relaxing atmosphere.Boredom In the dictionary, "boredom" is defined as the state of being tired. The word's synonyms range from "tedium" to "monotony" to "depression". When you are put into a situation that everything in the life remains the same day after day, you experience the feeling called " boredom". Teachers repeat their same lecture again and again for years although students are different Housewives do the work of cleaning, washing and cooking without any variation, energetic young men are limited to a small social circle, seeing the same faces of their friends last year, this year and probably next year......After enthusiasm and novelty have withered, boredom make [vp3, 1-] its appearance. It brings with itself the germ of disappointment and melancholy. Poor people who suffer from this inflammation always look worried and gloomy. The sequelae [fm1,-] affects the patient continuously and seriously. They pace to and fro in their narrow bedrooms, they lie in bed wide awake, tossing about from time to time. Boredom put [vp3, 1-] us in low spirits, painful and eager for new things to come. Gradually, some of the patients get recovery because they have found something stimulating. Often it is something unfavarouble [fm1,-]to do, unpleasant to hear. [sn9, s] Such as gambling. The pleasure of earning money, or the indignation for lossing [fm1,-] money may lead people to crime. On the other hand, other patients have a "rebirth " because they have found some things that are meaningful. They might move to another city, get to know new companions *. Everything they do is to avoid dullness, and to re-capture the interesting side of life. Therefore we can say that, boredom, as a temporary mental illness, is the sign of people's future tuning and changing. Unlike loneliness, which cam be cured by enjoying company, boredom needs the patient to recove [fm1,-] in the way he selects, that is, to cure himself by himself. It is not necessarily concerned with others. An old friend may not help at all. One day, when I returned to my dormitory cheerfully, with a book in my hand, I hardly bumped into A, one of my roomates [fm1,-]. "You seem so happy ," she said, " Some romance story must have happened!' " Nothing at all, actually." I answered. Then she found my book "yours [fm3, -]?" she asked. I explained that I lent [wd3, 1-] it from B, a male friend of mine."What? Is that tall boy in the French Department?" She looked at me with a secretive smile. "Yes." I mustered." Surely it is him !" I t seemed that she suddenly see [vp6,s-] the light. She always suspected that there was [vp3, 1-] relations beyond friendship between he [pr4, 1-] [pr4,s-] and me. " Between a women and a man,": She cleared her voice, and continued, "borrowing and lending a book are not simple matters----""What do you mean, then?" Interrupter her with a puzzled expression on my face. [sn8,s]She narrowed her eyes into a smile, then changed into a serious tone, saying that in the famous novel The Besieged City written by Qian Zhongshu, the author remarked that person who was in love with the other usually took borrowing books as an excuse. In that case you had to return the book after all, then naturally would be more than one chance for you to approach your beloved one.In a flash I understood what she meant. " There is nothing between he [pr4, 1-2] and I!" I retorted.                                                      "Don't be silly. Little girl.' [sn9, s] She behaved like an expert in love affairs, tenderly patted on my shoulder, " I've known all about you two."My face redden [vp6,s-] with anger. The further I explained, the remoter the victory. Finally, what I could do was to pull her pig-tail slightly and left some words as " I am not going to talk about this subject with you."

That was the 16th awarding reward of movies H.K.. As me [pr4, 1-] who is interesting in movies, of course would care about it.[sn2,s] In this year, the movie which I like best must be " The Honey". Because not only it has a good script, good music, but also it was acted by one of my favorite singer Leon Lai, and, Magie Cheng, who was my favorite actor. As you see, what can prevent me from loving it?The result has been published. It made me exciting and happy, because the film was loved by so many people and was awarded so many rewards, including the best woman actor. But it made me a bit disapointed [fm1,-], for Leon Lai was [vp7, 1-1] failed.Why do I love movies so much? Just because I have a dream. I dreamed I could be an actor in the future, of course not a normal one , but a famous, such like Tom Cluds, Al Pacino and so on, super stars in Holiwood[fm1,-].I am sure that I can do that.The Tsing Ma Bridge Hong Kong The Tsing Ma Bridge Hong Kong has been finished . That is almost the largest and greatest project in HK, in this centery [fm1,-].The bridge is a maily [wd7, 1-] part of Tsing---- Yu highway, and this highway is connected kowloon with the new airport, add up to 3.5 kilometres. [sn8,s]It breaks many world-reconds [fm1,-] and it is the most beautiful bridge which I've seen.In the evening, April 27th 1997, there was a wonderful open celebration of it, many famous foreign cities majoys [wd7, 1-] attended [sn9, s]after [fm3, 1-] that there was a fireworks show, too.

I hope H.K. will be better after she came back to mainland! My School Life The school life was the most colorful and wonderful part in all my life. Our school lies in a beautiful small city, near [wd5, -1] by a lake. We often went to the lake for visiting. And our teachers were youth, too. They were clever and also worth respacting [fm1,-]. They were strict with us in the classes but were kind to us after school. They even talked and played with us in spare time, not only taught us scientific knowledges [fm1,-] [np5, 1-] , but aslo [fm1,-] tried their best to made [vp5, 1-] us grow up healthily. In the school, we were friendly with each other, thought we quarraled [fm1,-] sometimes. But after a while, we would, become good friends again in no time. As you see, what a wonderful life we led in the school. I hope that I could be a student for ever, be young for ever. My New School This term I came to a mow [wd7, 1-] middle school for study. My new school is a key school which has a long history of more than seventy years. Many graduate [np3, 1-] of it, have become famous, some of them even have become soul persons in the society. Now our school has 36 classes, more than 1800 students, and 200 teachers. It is large and beautiful, with tall green trees around. And it has two teaching ---- towers [wd3, 1-3], an experiment tower, and a large playground. The students always have sports on the playground. And the most important reason that make [vp3, 6-] our school a key school is all the teachers are excellent, be strict with their students. However all the students respect their own teacher. [sn8,s] APR 25TH Sunday Sunny I went to visit the zoo of Canton with some good friends and classmates today. The weather was so fine and the suns-shine [fm1,-] was so nice. Then we went there by foot. It took us about half an hour to went [vp5, 1-] there. The zoo was so beautiful and so large that many visitors came there, including some foreign guests. All the people [vp7, -1] skruke [fm1,-] by the lovely monkeys. They made all kinds of faces and we couldn't help laughing. We also talked with some foreign guest [np3, 1-] in English. It was time for lunch when we got home. I really had a wonderful time today. JUN 14th Sunday Sunny The weather was fine today. It was almost 30C this afternoon. I saw that there was about 7 or 8 children swimming in the river. Most of them were good at it. And there was a little girl learning swimming with her mother's teaching. I aften [fm1,-] swim when I was still a child. My last swimming was in the holidays in Peking about 10 years ago. I thing [wd3, 1-3] that June is [vp6,s-] one of the best months in a year. The New Yuan Ming Palace The New Yuan Ming Palace has been finished building this year. It is a reproduction of the old royal palace----Yuan Ming Palace in Peking. It lies in a modern city of China----Zhuhai, which is near to Macau. There stands two cloud Pillars on the two sides of the main entrance and there's a Golden Water Bridge with white ----marble rails. Inside of it there are scores of scenic spots. Such as the " Just and Honorable Hall", the " long Corridor", " isle [fm3, 1-] of a Fair-land ", "Moon Platform", and" Gardens of a Thousand of countries [fm3, 1-]"......From these, you can know a little of the Royal life in the past, and you also will feel regret that such a beatiful [fm1,-]Palace has been distroyed [fm1,-].Being a Chinese, what will you think ? And what will you do for you [pr4, 1-] country?

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GDUFS>, <AGE ?>, <WAY ?>, <DIC ?>, <TYP 2>(c)?2?Chinese Book The afternoon before last.[sn2,s] Suddently [fm1,-] my classmate Liu Wei let out a cry of surprise, " Oh, my God! My Chinese Book has lost. I remember putting it in my bag. Why can't I find it now?" "Don't be worry. Think over, please. Perhaps, you put it in your desk!" [sn8,s]I said. Because I knowed [fm1,-] that Liu Wei always forgot something that she had [vp9, -1] do. So I said that. " Let me see." Liu Wei began to look for the Chinese Book. "Oh, yes. My book is in that desk. Look, here it is!" She showed the book to me. " Oh, no, isn't it my book?" I cried " Yes, this is your book. So where's my book?" I hurried to look it for [wd1, 1-] in my bag*..Can you imagine? Yes, Liu Wei's Chinese Book was in my bag. And mine was in her desk. Tea We often drink tea. But do you know the first place which [sn7, s] planted the tea? More than three hundred years ago, most of the people in Europe who liked to drink tea didn't know it. In fact, the Chinese people and the Indian people was [vp3, 1-] the first planted the tea. [sn8,s]It is said that an English sailor who went to countries in the East brought some tea from China. So the people in Europe began to drink the tea. People often say " drink the tea " [sn9, s] it's not to eat the tea-leaves, but to drink the water only. When you drink the tea, you will smell well, won't you? My new School I'm a student. My new school is a key school. It has a history of seventy years. Many graduates of this school have [vp9, -1] became the famous. There are thirty-six rooms in the school, and it has 1800 students and 200 teachers. My school is big and beautiful. There around the building are some green trees. It has two buildings where the students study in and a lab-building. After school, some students play on the big playground, and some practice. Teachers are good. They are strict with the students. And the students have the respect of their teachers. It's my school. Do you like it? I take pride in it! My classroom My classroom is 10 meters long and 8 meters wide. It has two doors and 16 windows. In the front of my classroom there is a blackboard. It is not "blank [wd7, 1-]" but white. Because the white-board has more use than the blank-board. [sn2,s]Beside the classroom there are planted some flowers. [sn8,s]When they bloom, they will give off the smell. So many students will stand beside them. Some will smell, and some will read books. How happy they are!My Little Brother One morning, my aunt said to my elder brother, "PinPin, there's a meeting of the party at my old friend's house at lunch time today, and I wan to go to it. I'll leave you some food for your lunch. Is that all right?"" Oh, yes, mum." PinPin answered, "that's quite all right. What are you going to leave for my lunch?" "This can of fish," my aunt said, "And there are some regetables [fm1,-]." "Good, I'll have a good lunch." So my aunt went to her meeting, and four o'clock my aunt came home. "Was your fish nice, PinPin?" she asked. "Yes, but my feet are hurting." he answered. "Why ?" "Well, the words on the can were: Open can and stand in hot water for five minutes."

When the night screen has hung down. [sn9, s] It's [fm3, 1-] about 6 o'clock, I'll go to the liberary [fm1,-] to take a seat and sit down to listen to the VOA news from the broadcasting. Then I'll write down the new words from it and consult the dictionary to learn [pr3, -1] it. After then, it's time of 7:30. I'll review the text and do my homework till the time of 9:00. Then I begin to preview the new text and try to learn the new words in the text. About 10 o'clock, I'll go to the cample [fm1,-]with one of my friends and have a free talk to improve my spoken English. Until 10:45, we go back to dorm [sn9, s], Then I go to W.C and have a wash. Then it's time to lie down to the bed and listen to B.B.C from 11:00 to 11: 15. After that I'll think about all the things I have done that day and what will do next day. Then I sleep. Today is the beginning of the winter vacation. I want to go home before the Spring Deliver. I can't stand the people in that time. So I go to the bus station with my friend. Oh, my God. There are overcrowded people in the Guangzhou train and bus station now. We go to the Liuhua bus station and even Huanshi Lu bus station and Guangdong bus station, the same thing is that I can't stand for two minutes, people will jostle you even you can't [wd3,1 -]want to move. We decided [vp6,s-] to the GuangFu bus station which in Zhongshan Road Seven.[sn8,s] Yes there is less people than before. But even than [fm1,-], people is jostle each other in a crowd. [sn8,s]I looking for the baggage and my friend go to the line to buy the ticket.[sn8,s]There are too many people. I can't find her. I only see a lot of head [np3, 1-2] and hand occure [wd3, -1] before the ticket window. After an hour [wd6, -1] later I find my friend catch two ticket [np3, 1-] with the sweats in her face. Then we go to the bus. There are more people who rush and strive to be the first and fear to lag behind to [wd5, 1-] the bus. There even to open the window and the driver's door to climb into the but.[sn8,s] I can't go into [wd4, s] for they push against me. My friend go into and find a seat in the front row for me and she help me to carry the baggage from the window and shouting: "Here, come here. Now you can elbow through the people among you." I came difficult to go into, I can't image those more people in the bus. [sn8,s]There are many people stand in it even it's a two-hour long bus if it no traffic. [sn8,s]And a lot of people go into it though the road. [sn8,s]I want to be a secretary after I leave here. But I don't want to work in Guangzhou, I only want to work in my hometown----- Zhongshan city. Because Guangzhou have too many people and traffic jam, and the environment is not peaceful not quitely [fm1,-] and [wd3, 1-] dirty. You must spend hours to work thought it's not far from the place you live. I often spend almost two hours to downtown even it's not the peak time, actually it's less than an hour's ride. And there are many traffic jam here and there. At my hometown you can go wherever you want, the auto are much more faster and convience [fm1,-] than Guangzhou. The environment are not peaceful quietly [wd2, 1-] and [wd3, 1-] dirty. There and many rob even happen every year and too many [fm1, -1]noice. [sn8,s]And I like peaceful and quietly [wd2, 1-] life best. If you stand in the street for a few minutes, your cloths [wd2, 1-] will cover with dust. The shop signs and buildings are cover with black color too. As the new city, Zhongshan has clear [wd3, 1-] things and streets, building [np6, 1-] , you can see street cleaners cleaning the street here and there. Dear Neighbor upstairs, I'm sorry to tell you about the fact what I heart from your apartment upstairs. I heart a great deal of noise all hours of the day and might [fm1,-] from [wd3, 1-] yours. About 6 o'clock, you get up and go to the water closet to have a bath and wash, the sound of water pass by the tap and the sound of your singing are very alound [fm1,-]. Then your wife get [vp3, 1-] up and go [vp3, 5-] to the kitchen to prepare for the breakfast, wash cup [np6, 1-2] and plate, the sound of cup knock at the plate can wake me up. [sn8,s]After that, I will heart [wd3, 2-2] you cry:" It's time to get up, child." "It's 6:45, 7:15 you must to downstairs to wait for the school bus." It keeps for about five minutes. Later, I heart [wd3, 1-3] you all go out and your wife wash [vp3, 2-1] plate and clothes, clean the floor for almost two hours. Then you would listen to CD for about an hour. About 11:30 you wife buy [vp3, 1-] food back for [pp1, 1-] market, I heart [vp6,s-] she prepare [vp3,1-] for lunch, then you all come back, after having lunch, your children playing game on TV, crying, shouting, sometimes laughing loundly[fm1,-]. About 3:00 your wife would listen to the radio to [wd4, s] body-building for half an hour. Then about 4:30 she will prepare for dinner. At the time of 5:00 you all go back, talking, laughing, eating for almost an hour. Later after 8:00 you will play Karaoke till 10:00. Then I think I can sleep, But [fm3, 1-] your [wd2, 1-] couple have bath wash to 10:45. After that I can heart [wd3, 2-]you menbers [fm1,-] go to W.C for several times all night the slip knock [wd4, s] the floor loundly [fm1,-] even wake me up. Then the same thing is like this another day. It's even for weeken [fm1,-] and holiday. I wonder if you can lower or not. [sn8,s]I look forward to being lower. [sn8,s]And the relationship between us are good.  Your honorest [fm1,-] downstairs 1994. Mar 14thClasses I Have Attended Two different kind [np3, 1-] of classes I have attended in this institute there are pay class and under-gratuade [fm1,-] class. [sn8,s] And there are two different conditions between them. First, the rules are different. It's loose in the pay class. Students can have class or relax themselves if they wish. Thought the Pay Students Rules said that if a student absent for one-third of classes, he would dismiss, some of us are often obsent [fm1,-]. Especialy [fm1,-] the dull class such as writing class and spoken English, there are often about twenty students attend. While the undergraduate are all attend and listen attentively to the lecture. Secondary, the study atmosphere are different between them. Pay class haven't any homework. Some of us never read book after class, they play card, make jok [fm1,-] ect[fm1,-], even in class, they often miss their attention. Sometimes teacher asked them, they would whisper to the students beside them which page or the key. But the undergraduate are work very hard. They listen lecture carefully, answer question clear, review words and text again and again after class. If you come to class morning, you will find they are reading lounderly [fm1,-], and in the evening, you will find one of the walk on the cample [fm1,-] and listen to VOA here and there. Two Restaurants The Expert's Restaurant and the GUFL Restaurant are quite different. First, the fixture and size are different. The Expert's Restaurant is smaller, it has only seven or eight tables, and the tables seem to casual to place. All things were served by yourself, including dinner set, kettle, tea, you need to take they to your table which you want. While GUFL Restaurant are much bigger, it has twenty-four or five tables totally. All things are served by the waiteresses [fm1,-], they work hard. When you get in, they would bring the suitable sets, bring tea you want and their face are always with smile. Secondary, the atmosphere and feeling are different. In the Expert's Restaurant, you feel coviently [fm1,-] and casually, you can do things freely, talk open view, laugh ect [fm1,-]. But in GUFL Restaurant, you would feel serious, romantic, and a sense of peaceful. You must talk in low speak, smile*.. [sn9,s] Last, the design is different. The Expert's Restaurant is brush on the wall, while the GUFL Restaurant is the brown color glasses replace the walls. Such are different between them. CECLCECL is the must major course at GUFL for the first and second year students. CECL can improve our hearing and speaking skill of English. When you listen to the tape and you may be preoccupy on it, you can't thinking other things but CECL. From the tape you can improve your reaction capacity, when you listen to it, you can improve your reaction capacity, when you listen to it, you can realize that how to speak with the others when they said something about. And you can learn a lot of new words from it. Many of them are everyday expression, some of them are rarely use. But you can learn them in a systematic, because they are classify in a certain column and system. Say animals and plants column. CECL would enrich your knowledge, wilden [fm1,-] your quantity of the new words, learn things from them, realize things and knowledge and what their name, how to spell it. And my most favorte[fm1,-] are cookery and the plants, because they intraduce[fm1,-] many things I like, the delicious vegetables and cultivate for many years.But if you want to learn it better, you can't preview it and can listen to the tape. You only can review it and you would find this way is more good for you. Friend A friend is who when you were memory, you could feel warm and touch. A friend is a different person in your different period. From whom you cam escape when you feel awful, you can cry when you are unpleasure[fm1,-], you can releave[fm1,-] when you feel boring and loneliness. A friend is a person who would help you when you need. Before whom you can say everything you can't tell before others you both can contech [fm1,-]with open mind, speak from your heard not keep in secret. A bosom friend is enough, the ordinary you can have much more. A friend in need is a friend indeed. Teacher and me When I am in my childhood, I think teacher coolness and indifference maybe sometimes snobbery [fm1,-]. I dislike even hate teacher anyway. In my childhood at the primary school, I think teachers are prejudice against me, I'm good enough I think, but why teachers are always criticise me in the public. Why they always said that I'm too lazy, and my maths lack of hight score, last they even call me to their office and said: "if you always like this, you will lost your chance to join the control middle school, then you will in the disavanced [fm1,-] position to be good." When I go out of the office I said :" I hate control middle school, there have the stict [fm1,-] rules, I want to do everything myself, I can't controlled by anybody." I hate them. As the result, I enrolled in a ordinary middle school. In middle school, I have a rules life, I can do anything myself, sometime when I calm down, I feel a little bit regret. The second year of middle school, teacher Miss Du is in charge of us, she teaches us of Chinese. And she always find my mistakes in my homework sand grammar rule, spead [fm1,-] loudly in the class, then the whole class are laughing at me. " I hate you," I said in my heat" you put me in the shameness [fm1,-] position." Meanwhile I'm afraid of her, so every time I saw her, I'll go for a stroll to avoid her. The worse time come, one day she even said loudly:" Oh, you see, the laziest fellow, I warn you servel [fm1,-] time but why not even have a change," her voice more louder and go to my seat " would you please say a little about your lazy and rules [fm1,-], Shirley." " Oh, my God, what she is like, she full of energy and exitment [fm1,-], she more like a hog than any other things. I will have a retaliatory measures, hog, remember, I will. No long, you will regret what you said just now. My Chinese is good indeed, don't you know? first, I will do my homework as well as the top one, even better than her, wait and see, hog." I speak in my heart and my eyes fill with hatre[fm1,-]. Since that, I try my best to do things I must do at once, and everything got well. At the end of that term, I got the top scores of Chinese. I could saw that she was quite exiting." What does she look like, a snobery person, a trim her sails villain. I hate you, and I would remember all things you done forever. You look down upon me----- a nice student." I whisper. Servel [fm1,-] years past, I feel regret for my teacher, Miss Du, she does want me good, she does is a good teacher, I think. " I am lack of sensible mind that time. Excuse me, Miss." I murmur. But things were lost, time past, and I have no chance to say sorry to her and thanks for her kindness. I am not hate teacher any more, in stead [fm1,-] of this, I like them very much, nowadays [fm1,-].

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GDUFS>, <AGE ?>, <WAY ?>, <DIC ?>, <TYP 2>????Madam, Although my self experience has told me that women are very hard to deal with. I decide to give you a lesson so as you can keep silence! I can't bear any more. In the past, I led a calm life, no one distrurbed [fm1,-] me. But three months ago, you became my neighbor, since then on, all my life customs had [vp6,s-] to be rearranged. I have to sleep in the daytime and go to my office to work at night, you are actually an artist of noise! You sing bad songs before the window, turn in very loud sound, throw cans and boxes heavily to the floor, and made [vp6,s-] other strange noise which I have never heard before! All these I have beared [fm1,-], I know clearly how an excellent man should act in such a case. Not with standing your [wd7, -1] gilt [fm1,-] are too numerous to mention. Things became aggravated. Yesterday noon, you came back with a [np7, 1-] ugly baby,(God knows who is his father, you are an unmarried woman, right?) and all the afternoon the damned baby cried and cried, like a roaring horn, and the worst of it, you blew a trumpet. I didn't know you like blowing trumpet, otherwise I should have taught you how to blow. But your trumpet was obviously a noise-producer. Hell! I don't know how long can I live in such a noisy house. I considered of leaving here, but I have lived here so [wd4, 1-]years, I love everything here, except you and your baby. So regret to tell you, that you'd better leave here soon, otherwise I will cut off your telephone line, electricity and water supply stealthily, and a friend of mine, who is good at stealing, will visit your room frequently. Cities I have Visited Cities I have visited can generally be divided into two types, modern and traditional. Guangzhou, is one of the most modern city in China. There, skyscrapers can been [vp9, 1-] seen everywhere. All kinds of motocars [fm1,-] fill the wide road. Railway, express way, overhead highway, ocean liner and airlines make the transportation very convenient and efficient. Citizens there are rich than the inlanders [fm1,-], and their idea is also modern and open. Shaoxing, a medium sided [fm1,-] city in Zhejiang province, is a typical tranditional [fm1,-] Chinese city. It has no skyscaper [fm1,-], no overhead high way, not to mention expressway, the most speedy transportation railway is constanted [fm1,-] by japanes [fm1,-] before liberation. Tile-roofed buildings and sampans compose the feature of the city. Citizens there are not so open-sighted and mammonistic [fm1,-] as in the southern cities. Many of them and [fm1,-] still keeping there [fm1,-] long-lasted life style inherited from their ancestors. In fast, the distinction between modern cities and traditional cities is becoming more and more vague. Modern culture and traditional culture exist simultaneously in many cities. But all those cities have the same develop [wd2, 1-] trend, they are becoming more and more modern. Two Schools By far I have only studied in three schools: a primary school ,a middle school and a university. The latter two give me great impression, so now I will talk about these two schools Dan Middle school and GDFL. Dan Middle school is a famous school in my hometown, it has1, 200 students, desided [fm1,-] into 24 classes, each class has almost 50 students. It lies at the foot of a mountain called Dan mountain, there are trees and flowers on campus, some of them are very precious. There is even a [np7, 1-] orchard behind the school building, with loquat, purple, arrange [fm1,-] and some other fruit trees in it, all many greedy students. Compared with Dan Middle school, GUFL is much bigger and famous. It has more students and teachers, more classes, but each class has only 20---30 students. It also lies at the foot of a mountain, it also has many trees and flowers on campus, but you can't find a single fruit tree there. Neverthless [fm1,-], you can satisfy you [pr4, 1-] stomach in canteens, food stalls and restaurants, you can easily find them. Since GUFL is a foreign languages university, students and teachers come from every part of the world, you can hear a lot of languages and dialects spoken there, while in Dan Middle school, you can only hear home's dialect, and English. The disciplines in GUFL is much looser than in Dan Middle school, there you can smoke, can drink, can talk freely, can have love affairs. Students have much free and colorful lives. CECL is a course of English for Chinese learners, it has its distinction compared with other language courses. First of all, CECL pays high attention on listening and oral skills. There are many listening and oral skills. There are many listening and oral exercises in this course. So to have this course, each student prepares their [pr3, 1-] own earphone, the teacher plays the CECL tape through a recorder, students listen to it and do the exercises on the book. Then the teacher checks students' answer. If necessary, the tape will be played again. As to oral exercises, the teacher usually devides [fm1,-] the class into several groups, each was 2 or 4 students, then the teacher set [vp3,1-] the students talk about the topics in English, the teacher listens to some of them and sometimes takes part in a certain group talking. If the topic is controversial, the teacher will allow students again. [sn8,s] Reading and writing also compose a very important part of CECL. There are many reading meterials [fm1,-]in CECL books, after students read them, they will be asked to do exercises, such as answering questions, do alternative choice commenting, etc.[sn8,s] Sometimes the teacher will ask the students to write a [np7, 1-] essay on the topic in or out side class. In CECL, materials for studying is not limited inside CECL, the teacher often offer other English materials to the students, such as English newspapers, magazines, foreign movies and English radio programme, etc. That's the distinction of CECL. Masculinity is the quality or state of having the qualities suitable for a man. It contains two aspects external masculinity and internal masculinity. External masculinity is observable from appearance. People usually define external masculinity as follows: tall and bright eyes, walks like a gale and stands like a pine. So within that defination [fm1,-], those who have poor eye sights, short or thin bodies, milky skins should be absolutely ruled  at  from the troops of [fm2, -1]he-men. [sn8,s]However, nowadays people consider internal masculinity more than external masculinity, especially those who have been ruled out from external [fm1, -1] mascular [fm2, -1]he-men. They define real [fm2, -1]he-man as that, a man with strong will and great endurance, he has his own ideal and struggle hard continuously for it, he will not weep when failed, never bend before others or difficulties, he may be thin and feeble in body, but his spirit is made of iron and steel. That is the internal masculinity, is it more difficult to achieve than external masculinity! It was 4 o'clock now, I reckoned uncle Wang should be at home at this time, so I picket up the phone and dialed his home. "Hello," a clear voice emerged. I knew it was uncle Wang's elder daughter. "Hello, this is Zhang Qing. I want to speak to uncle Wang, is he there? "Yes, wait a minute, please." After a few seconds. [sn2,s] The phone was picked again at the other end. "Hello, is that Zhang Qing?" "Yes, uncle Wang. I have something to tell you ." I answered hesitatingly. "Say it please." "Yesterday you ask me to post the packets at Huale Post office. I got there. The postman told me that there was no small-sized packet-box which we need, and he suggested me waiting [wd4, s] a few days. So I didn't post the packet yesterday." "Why, I have just post [vp9, 3-] the same size packet there last Wednesday!" "Yes, I know. But the postman said they had just used out that kind of packet-box." "OK, I think we'd better wait [wd4, s] a few days, You know that post office charges the lowest service free compared with others." "I know it, uncle Wang. So I will wait [wd4, s]a few days and try again on Wednesday." "OK, so, anything else?" "Nothing. Good-bye" "Good-bye!' I finished the call. When I was old enough to know what is teacher, I was told that it meant "poor". From a distant relative who is a teacher living in Guangzhou, what remained in my little mind was his poor housing condition and eating little meat at dinner. Once his son----- [sn9,s] an only child, was seriously ill, the poor father could do nothing because he had no enough money at hand. Later the boy was recovered, but the whole family was in debt, for a long time. The idea of being a teacher distressed me deeply. Not long ago, I went to see the relative again. He was retired while he loves teaching, so he acted as a part-time teacher. Actually I knew he still needed money. He told me something happened when he left Beijing during the journey on a train. After having visited his son, a teacher, in Beijing, for one week, the old father came home, along with him a 30-year old small black old suitcase, somewhat like school bag. At the beginning of the trip, it was peaceful. But one deep night, no one knew when, one section of the train where my relative stayed was robbed. Maybe due to fewer passengers than other sections, and there were no policemen, the passengers had to take out money, necklaces, etc. My poor kind relative tried his best to find out something valuable when the robbers faced him. He murmured, " I only have the tomorrow-breakfast-fee and the ticket-fee." Well ...n [wd7, 1-1] othing? "Er You know, I am a teacher, a " One of the robbers heard the last word, without awaiting the whole sentence "a retired one." He declared like a trump with despair, " Take care of your worn bag, old gentleman, I don't rob you. Teachers are still too poor to be robbed nowadays! Boys, go!" He waved his arm to other robbers and came at the rest passengers. Therefore, in the whole section, all the passengers were left few things except my old relative. When others "congratulated" him, his feeling coupled luck and sadness. Dear Mr. [wd6, -1]A and Mrs. A, I'm now writing to complain about the noises coming down from your house. In general, being a new neighbor of you I feel quite all right but for the noises. Almost every early morning since you came to live upstairs, Mrs. A sang [vp6,s-]songs from 5:30 to 6: 30. I form a habit of getting up late because I study till 11:30 at night. Mrs. A is a good singer but her voice is too loud, when she sings just a few meters above me.[sn8,s] I've tried earphones and I try to go on sleeping but it doesn't work. Now I get up at 5: 30am, and do morning reading with sleepy head and body. I know that you, Mr. A and Mrs. A, like pork very much. From 1:45pm to 2:00pm, 3 days per week, I hear the noises of chopping pork Mrs. A bought in the morning. At that time, unfortunately I am preparing my lessons in the afternoon. I can't concentrate my attention in reading with sounds made my [fm1,-] the chopping block and chopping knife. For these 2 weeks, you have Dance Competition to prepare. I'd like to see your dance but I will appreciate if you turn the radio a bit down. Besides that, would you not dance at other time but not from 9: 30pm to11:30pm? The steps are too heavy to stop the thrilling of my ceiling. As you know, the walls and ceiling are insulated badly. Last night, I saw something falling down from the ceiling, not dust. I have a bit worried about my safety and that of the house. By the way, I have a very very important exam next week and I am now busy in reviewing. Therefore I am not able to enjoy the dance and jazz music. Would Mr. A and Mrs. A have a little mercy on me? I look forward to hearing from you soon. Three games I've been playing are good for health, both in body and in mind. First of all, the game in summer is what I love most. And I love swimming. Summer seems a bit long here, including a 2-monthes summer holiday. The weather is so hot that I nearly want to cool myself in the pool all day long. In order to keep fit and a clear mind in study in spite of the boiling temperature, I have to take the swimming pool as the best place. Secondly, I like to play badminton in autumn. At the end of December, I usually have to prepare for exams, therefore, I have less time in playing. I often keep myself at home, as hard-working as a beaver. Mother sometimes drive me out of my " self-made prison " to rest. Then I ask friends to the badminton play-ground, enjoying autumn sun and autumn breeze. My tireness [fm1,-] dies away soon after the game. Finally, chess is played in spring and winter. Spring is ranny [wd7, 1-] season till we greet summer. That indicates less time for outdoor games to me. While winter is too cold to have sweat all-over my back and face. That's the reason that invite friends to play chess in winter holiday and in spring from time to time. Though chess seems to rob my brain some energy, it gives me rest as the badminton does. Since most of the time find failure in chess, I do not like to as much as I like badminton.[sn8,s]Games make my life fill with laughter, friendship and health. They will accompany me in all my life. I have been to two different restaurants which have difference various in environments, inner-restaurant settings, guests and waiters or waitresses. But they all bring me comfortable feelings. Restaurant A lies in the suburb and it is small in size. While Restaurant B is in the center of the city and it is large. Restaurant B is designed in the middle of a park. Restaurant A is somewhat like a classical restaurant. Oil paintings decorate the white wall, together with four soft lights pink. In contrast to A, B is simple. It has greenish walls, with four big windows without glass. From the windows, you can look directly into the park around you. Children playing, laughing, and jumping make it a bit noisy. However, A is obviously more peaceful. Restaurant A is near several [fm3, -1]Foreigners' houses, therefore, they always come there to enjoy dinners together. Usually half foreigners and half Chinese have dinner there. But it's no [wd2, 1-] so with Restaurant B. Almost all the customers are Chinese. Some kind of convinence [fm1,-] it brings is that whoever comes there can enjoy the food and the scenery. Restaurant A has five waiters or waitresses behind the counter and so the customers buy their food and sit down to enjoy it. Nevertheless, B has ten waitresses hurrying here and there, taking plates of dishes. Customers should first select courses from the menu and sit down to wait for them, drinking tea. After dinner, the waitress will come and you have your bill paid. For the previous whole two years, I had learned CECL-----Communicative English for Chinese Learners. This course is divided into eight text-books. And each kind of text-book is composed of teacher's text-book and student's text-book which we have in hand. Therefore in general, there are 16 books of CECL. The content is obviously large-scale. Let's take the unit " Environment "as an example. A hard-working student will first have a thorough survey of the lists of new words or phrases. Sometimes, the kind-hearted teacher gives them to us. It's not an easy work for me to prepare the hundreds of words useful in one unit. For the whole weeks of learning this unit, I found myself big-headed and heave-hearted, but still confidential [wd2, 1-] to catch 1/4 of the new words into my mind temporarily. The first 2 classes were tiresome. There were three tasks for us to do. First we had intensive reading. That's, we tried to find the answers from an article about 3 thousands words. It was a comment on Environment Pollution. We all were busy in looking through the article and at the some time finding the answers. After answering to questions, we did the vocabulary exercises. We had to look through the article again. The words were immense-scale, I think of owning four eyes or more. [sn8,s] It happened that the second task was in the second class. We had the listening. It was a long long article . Two persons were discussing the prevention of pollution . After it, the gap fillings and questions were waiting for us. We should finish them according to the tape after listening for one time. All the words should be done with a highly concentrated head. The rest time was to discuss the issue in the previous article about pollution. The teacher asked us to give our own opinions on the final paragraph, where the author gave his own opinion. Some discussed it with their partners without problems. Some discussed another " topic " excitedly. At the moment, some of us were sleepy. Therefore, we kept talking, talking and talking, and kept our eyes open, open and open. Then, some pairs would receive the respectful inspiration of the teacher. Others brought out their long long breath. The pair tried to hide their voices and, of course, tried to give a very brief answer---- no more than 3 sentences, 15 words. Finally, we hoped for the mercy bell. Some students might not agree with me, for they owned the teacher's book which contains all the answers in the student's book. BoredomIn my opinion, boredom has three meanings. One of them in the dictionary is : A sense of being tired and uninterested by being dull or [fm1, -1] tendious. To illustrate it I am to give you example. Once I came to visit a friend who newly worked in a kindergarten. It happened that she was telling a story full of feelings to the small ones. I over-heard one child near the door said," We hear the story 9 times." The other one corrected him," 10 times, I bet." And two of them gave a long breath. At first, the children showed calmness and patience. Four sentences later, they couldn't sit any longer and they seemed uneasy. The poor teacher didn't notice it and went on and on. In the middle of the story-telling, a child or two seemed that they wanted very much to interrupt my friend. I knew they could not, for they were thought it was impolite to do so. Some of them even had their [wd6, -1]eyebrows frowned their eyebrows. Then they talked to each other in low voices. Then in louder voices. Later, my poor friends noticed the noisy class and realized that it was an oldest story. When a person can't find anything to do, it is boredom who visits him. [sn8,s]N [fm1,-1]one Sunday morning, when I was awake, no one is found in the room. I felt lonely and it turned out to be boring. I washed my face and brushed my teeth slowly, like a snail. Then I tried to find something to eat but only got half a bowl of cookies. I gorged on them. Then I should read something and discovered that I should first listened to the music. And so I turned on radio, walk-man and TV. I was absent-minded throughout the whole morning. I sang "Country- road' sometime and danced for a while. Later I drank a cup of tea and a glass of milk and a bowl of fruit juice. Finally at 12:00pm . I slept. Boredom is a bad thing like the words said by Bertrand Russell. "Boredom is a vital problem for the moralist since at least half the sins of mankind are caused by fear of it." But it is something that none of us can resist. One thing happened when I was a 4-year-old girl which is impressed deep in my mind. At 6:00pm on one summer day in the country-side, I came home from the kinder-garden. Twelve minutes' walk made me so thirsty that I rush to the small store not far away from my house. A gentle-lady who was no more than 60 greeted me." Lovely girl, what can I do for you?" she smiled to me. "Would you please sell me the biggest ice stick" I replied quickly and politely, wiping my wet face. Then the old lady kindly asked me whether I took money or not. I said confidentially, "Yes, I have many money. You see." I reached into my pocket and hurried out a big coin which was marked "5 cent." At that time I didn't know even the cheapest ice stick cost 10 cent. I merely found out that the price in the counter was marked 0.1yuan. It seems that 5 was much more than 1 yuan. I caustiously [fm1,-] put the coin on the counter which was nearly as high as me. "Oh " the granny whispered, staring at the coin. It made no sense to me and I was dying of thirst I anxiously looked at the granny. She first took a glimpse at me and smiled. She hurried out a big wooden box covered with 2 towels. I looked at the crystal-like precious ice stick handed to me. "The biggest one for you. Eat as quick [wd2, 1-] as you can. It milt easily." She softly told me. I reached out hands and accepted it eagerly. " Thank you " I wanted to go. "Wait, wait, child. Here's your change." The granny called me back. My "Change'----1 cent. I happily took the shinning coin and with are more thanks to her, [sn8,s]I came home, enjoying the ice. I caught sine [wd7, 1-] words behind. " only for a little lovely and thirsty girl.."

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GDUFS>, <AGE ?>, <WAY ?>, <DIC ?>, <TYP 2>????3?Dear neighbor, I am the person who lives on the lower floor under your room. I do not want to border [fm1,-]you but I find I must write this letter to you because I have suffered too much noise whice [fm1,-] I am sorry to say that, are mostly comes from your room. so [fm3, 1-] I wonder if you can be kindly to stop making that noise and leave me a quiet life? I am also a fan of rock roll, But [fm3, 1-]I do think that playing the CD of Michael Jackson loudly at the six of morning is [wd4, s]a good habitude. Everyday morning I am woken up by those shout, cry, from my honeyed [wd2, 1-] dream and you will also think it is not enjoyment. You are a lucky person, for you have a lot of friends to call on. I guess your chatting must be very interesting because it is quite easy for me to hear wild laughing and scream when you are talking. I must admit that I am affected by them and I can not do writing or reading anymore so I always have to leave my room to the liberory [fm1,-] to prepare my lesson. But unfortunately the liberory [fm1,-] closed at 7pm and I must return my room when you begin watching TV. Maybe you are very kind for knowing that I do not have a TV set so you let me share yours by offering me the sound. I do apperiated [fm1,-] you for letting me knowing the up-to-date news all over the world every day. But the "Six dreams" of Taiwang and the American COP and bandit are something I realy [fm1,-] dislike so would you please just enjoy it by your own when these programs begin? I am not a crietive [fm1,-]person and if it is not because I find I can't get even one minute of quiet in my own room will not I write this letter to ask you make your "Living sound" a bit [wd5, -1]of lower and do not give me any dance to share you enjoyment of music, friendly chatting and TV programs.[sn8,s] Please, my dear neighbor, please enjoy them by you [wd2, 1-]own. Your sincerely Classes I Have Attended Class makes you smile or class lets you sleep are two types of classes I have attended. The first kind of class always has a teacher of midium [fm1,-]age or just a bit older. He or she must has rich teaching experience and more important, willing to understand what the students are thinking about. The teacher never says bad words to the students. On the other hand, he or she seldom praise a student. He or she just tells the students what they will face to and helps them to resolute [wd3, 1-] all kinds of problem. The teach [wd2, 1-] need not interrupt the class by some cheap jokes, however, he or she just show students a mysterial [fm1,-]world which is worth knowing. Then the student [np6, 1-] will naturally find it's interesting to follow the teacher. A class is passed while you think it is too short. The teachers give students second kind of class must be in their 40's or 50's or a bit younger. They do want to teach the students some useful knowledge and more or less they are kind teacher. They also have rich experience but to us [wd2, 1-] surprise this is often worse than lack of experience. This experience always lead to unchangable [fm1,-] dullness. I have attended some this kind of classes and all the teachers effort is to bump their knowledge into your head. They may be work. To hard that they bump too much things into my head and I feel it turns too heavy to raise. [sn8,s]So it falls down into dark emptyness [fm1,-] of dream. Thanks God that most classes I have attended are not those sleepy classes. And thanks God that I will have class to attend. During the years I stayed in the secondary school, I have been to two schools. One is the 26th Secondary School, my junior middle school, and the other one is The First Secondary School where I passed three years as a senior middle school student. My life in these two schools are quite different. The 26th and the First are all not too big, each has about 1,000 students. However, The First is more beautiful and more convenient than The 26th. In The First, there are three four flow buildings as students' class room, a six flore [fm1,-1] loboratry, a hall and a liberary [fm1,-]. But The 26th has no hall nor liberary [fm1,-], and its loboratry [fm1,-] is much smaller than The First's which consists of only 7 rooms. We can just do some simple exercises in The 26th. There is also a small park in The First, students can sit under the trees or by the flowers during the break while in The 26th it is difficult to find out a tree. The teaching method in the two schools are [vp3,5-] different, too. The 26th's teachers always give students some added lessons. It seems that they will teach, too things for the students to remember. They also give a lot of homework to the students. I have to burn my night oil quite often to finish it. On the contrary, teachers in The First would rather let the students learn knowledge by their own will. They never let the homework crush down the students. However, they allow students not to hand it in if the students think they know to do it correctly. The 26th only concentrate on the students' study. The teacher there don't [vp3,3-] encourage students to take part [vp2, s] sports. Sometimes they even forbit [fm1,-] students playing basketball ---the only thing we can do after school --- for the fear of that we may spent too less time on study. But when I in The First, teachers always remind us to go out the classroom and do some physical exercises. There are various tournaments been held each semester. Before the beginning of a CECL course, students must prepair [fm1,-] their tape recorder well. They should make it can work when need.[sn8,s] Then students should get out their CECL books and waiting for their teacher. The teacher is the director of a CECL course , students should follow their teacher's order and do what their teacher asks them to do. Usually the class begins with a passage in the textbook. Students read that passage and after finishing it answer the teacher's question. For example, there is maybe a short passage about basketball full of information about how to play it or its development history. The questions may be "How to play basket [fm1, -1] bad" or " When does basketball take place?" Students should answer question [np6, 1-] according to their understanding of the text. Next thing students will meet may be a short conversation. Teacher plays the tape and students try to catch as many as possible words they heared [fm1,-1] , remerbering them and understanding them. Sometimes it is need for student [np6, 1-] to write down what the [fm1,-1] heared. [sn8,s] Sometimes they should fill in the blank [np6, 1-] in their textbook. Sometimes they just listen to the tap and then discuss its content with their classmates, trying to express their opion [fm1,-] in English. Then, there may be another passage asked for [wd5, 1-] students to read or another conversation to listen. The class is mainly containing with these two things. During the practice of using English, Time flies very fast and a class may end seeming quite soon. [sn8,s] A friend may not be a handsome boy or beautiful girl who you admire so much that you want to be noticed by him or by her. A friend may not be the person who walks beside you to your home, telling you that Tom's bick [fm1,-] has lost and Marry smiled to Jack this morning and there is no homework tonight. A friend may not be the fellow sitting in frond of giving you a cigarette, saying "bottoms up" with you and laughing stupidly. A friend may be a red cloud hanging under the sinking sun along the western mountains. A friend may be the letter flying down on your desk, making you smile when you feel too boring to live any longer. A friend is the people who you want to see and cry to him when your girl friend or boy friend says bye-bye to you. When you walk along the quiet road in the night just by yourself, a friend is the face appears in your mind and smiles to you. In your diary, a friend is that " You" you talk to with your pen. Some day, a friend turns to be the reason to asure [fm1,-] you that this world has something worth remembering. Another day, a friend is the words safe or sincere or fathe [wd7, 1-] or believe. And, a friend is the person you smile to before and will smile to whenever you saw [vp6, s-] him or her. And a friend is the warm smile in your heart forever and ever. A sharp ring broke my heavy dream. I picked up the phone and said " Hello, who is that?" "Hi, guy. Do you know what's wrong with you." "Yes," I said. "I should not follow Qing to that dark room and drink three bottles of wine. But Qing is the prime culprit. You'd better arrest him." Qing said a four letter word at the other end and laughed a bit. Then he said," Will you come tonight ? We find something extremely fan." "I don't know," I answered." Let me have a look ."It was already 4pm. Sun shine went through the curtain into my room and my bed. But I could not find my calendar. I remembered I had being put it on the table but there were only some clothes. [sn8,s]"What date is today?" I asked Qing on phone. "A good day," He answered." Come on. You never care about date. You gave [wd3, 1-] a lot of time. Come and," he stopped a little bit then continued in a lower vioce [fm1,-] full of attraction, " here must have some friends you want to see." He was right . I told him that I really wanted to go but in somewhere deep in my mind a vioce [fm1,-] kept telling me that I would do an important thing that day. "What is it." I didn't know. I looked around hoping see something which can remind me. Several empty bottles at the corner, clothes on the table and floor, a book named Waste City near the door, and dazzling sunlight, those are all. I couldn't remember what I would do." Are you sure?" "I think so." "OK. You have forgotten it, haven't you ?" Then forget it forever. Come on, we are waiting for you." I heard the happy laugh and shout they made through the phone and hesitaded [fm1,-]a little while and said " Well, I think I will be in yours soon." "Fine!" he shouted and some body followed him shouting, "See you." I put down the phone, bend sown [fm1,-] to pick up my trousers. When I was dressing myself, I turned to the big minor in the wardrobe and suddenly saw a red paper cutting character on it. It was the Double Happiness. Then I found this character on my door and even the sideboard of my bed. I remembered that I would marry a girl, my wife, tonight. 

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GDUFS>, <AGE ?>, <WAY ?>, <DIC ?>, <TYP 2>"??It is a high class club at the top of the hill. On the platform, there are several square tables which are covered with white table-clothes with exquisite lace. Every table has an delicate crystal vase with freshred [fm1,-] rose in the middle. In the glow of the setting sun, at a quiet corner a young lady and a gentleman are having dinner face to face beside a table from which they can overlook the whole city. They are talking in low voice smiling, and enjoying the gentle breeze and the beautiful scenery. Before the lady, on the right side of the table is a bundle of fresh lily. Beside the flower is a silver plate of beefsteak with silver knife and silver folk on the right and left on it. Left above the plate is a half glass of juice. The things before the gentleman are hardly the same except a cup of coffee instead of the juice. Between them is a basket of fruit with a bottle of sealed champane [fm1,-] in it. Suddenly, the gentleman picks out a ring from his pocket, asking the lady with a charming smile:" Will you marry me?" Go in the room, the first impression is the opposite wall. [sn8,s]The upper part of the wooden wall is covered disorderly by pieces of paper pictures and posters. In the middle, there is a poster : a man and a woman, both in suits of Bachelor clothes holding their certificates, are standing arm in arm on the top of the globe, with line of words on the bottom. On the right side, an advertisement, which was clipped to the shape of the pattern, covers part of the post---- A big bottle of Coca Cola is standing on the left of a Santa Clause who is smiling enjoyfully with also a bottle of Coca Cola in hand. A cut-out paper-board is stuck additionally on the lower part of the two pictures. The wall below is of two completely different sights. The left part is dirty, made up of pieces of board, and showing its original wood color, while the right part is clean, bright with white wall-paper on it. A long stick broom is placed up side down against the wall in the left corner. On the wooden floor, in the middle of the room, there is a shabby, worn-out carpet whose color is fading. A rocking arm-chair made of rattan stand between the carpet and the wall. The back of the chair, which is leaning against the white wall, is high and exquisitely designed. And it seems to be the most comfortable thing in the room. It's a typical western little town of America. Two stories low buildings stand along both sides of the street. Some horses are walking around in distance. On the broad street, a tall and well-built policeman (a badge of cop pinning on his left chest) is walking ahead. He is also dressing in an entirely western-American style, not very fashionable, but smart. There is a black hat on his head. On his string body, there are a while shirt with a bow-tie on the collar and a waistcoat. A badge of cop is on left chest while the watch chain is hanging on the right of the waist. He is wearing a pair of leather shoes and two leather belts at waist. On the lower belt, there is a gun-package. He is not young any more and about 45 yeas old and sent forth the charming of a mature man all over. Age has left some signs on his face. No countenance appears on his experienced, hard face. He is staring firmly ahead, lips close tightly, fist cleach [fm1,-]. His stops are so calm that it seems her [fm1,-] can deal with any kind of chellange [fm1,-] of the criminals without fear. There are a man and two girls in front of the door beside the street. They seem to be father and daughters. The man, wearing a pair of glasses, is about 30 years old. Although he is tall and thin, his face is covered with sad cloud at the moment. The little girl, which is about 2 years old and seems to be the younger sister, is riding on her father's shoulders. Nothing cheerful can be seen on her little tight face. Instead, she seems to be able to break into tears at any moment. The elder one, only 4 years old at most, presses her body close to the door with hands clenching on it. The strong wind from anywhere has tangled their hair. The solid double iron door has separated them from the inside world. They are so weak in the wind and have not any aggressiveness. But despite the coldness, they are still standing there so firmly. Nothing can disturb them. Nothing can prevent them. The three pairs of eager eyes are concentrated and they ate trying their best to see through the unfeeling door to find the person they want behind it, although nothing might be seen. They are so silent, so quiet. But we can really hear the cry from deep in their heart: "Give me back my wife!" "Give us back our mother." "Give us a complete family!" At 6pm, I turn on the radio on time. Listening to the news on VOA, I am used to take a pen in one hand to write down some unknown words according to it [pr4, 1-] pronunciation and consult the dictionary afterwards. In the other hand, there is always an apple or an orange. After listening for half an hour, I go to take a bath---- with cold water. I have kept the habit for more than 4 years, although in winter great courage is really needed. Besides it can make people healthy, it become more necessary now ---- we moved from the ground to the second floor the term, a far way from the place where hot water is supplied. After that, of course it is time to wash clothes .It is a dull and monotonous process. To make it more interesting. [sn2,s] I always take a walk-man with me and even sing loudly. This period is also regarded a relaxation preparatory to the study. [sn8,s]From7:30 , it is 2 hours' fixed time to study. At about 9:30, I am called out , either to practice oral English or to take my tuitor [fm1,-] job. There [fm1,-]two things are quite different. Having free talk in English with a wise person can both improve my speaking English and enrich my knowledge. And I quite enjoy walking around the campus at night. While to teach a not so clever guy is an unpleasant and dull job. But I have to keep it. I need some extra money to complement my expense. Being back to the domitory [fm1,-], I spend a few minuts [fm1,-] having chat, reading magazines on [fm1,-] eating something if I am hungry. At the exact time of 11pm, lights go off turn on the Walkman, go into the dreams accompanying with music.. [sn8,s]Before midnight, the train entered Hunan province and stopped at a small station. A group of people which were dressed like peasants dashed into the carriage. The man walking in the front was about 40 years old. He was wearing a straw hat, a dirty shirt with several holes on it, a green army trousers and a pair of Liberation Brand cloth shoes .His back was bent by the full cloth bag on his shoulder. Sweat could be seen on his bronze-color face.He walked [wd3, -1]cross the carriage quickly and gave a careful check of the place under each seat. As he found each place had been occupied, he was quite disappointed and turned back. Finding a most convenient place, he unloaded the bag and untied it . He had got a big palm with thick callus and short big fingers. The blood ressels [fm1,-1] pretruded [fm1,-]dearly [fm1,-] on the back of the hand. At last, he took out a little square strool [fm1,-] and sat on it, satisfied , watching other people squeezing here and there to settle down. The stuffed carriage was so hot, he had to [wd7, -1]sweep away . The sweat on his forehead with towel now and then. [sn8,s] Looking around the people sitting side by side to he [pr4, 1-] and hesitating for a while, he took off his shire [fm1,-] which was all wet with sweat. A terrible mixture smell of tobacco and sweat [fm1, -1] game out .He gave a apologize smile to the people , showing his yellowish teeth. As the crowd calmed down, the train moved, he hold his bag tightly in arms and fell asleep. At exact 9am ----the regular time to start work in the morning, I stepped into the office . As usual, I was the first arrival. It was a big state-owned institution. Because of the good working condition and payment , I made great effort and at last find a position as common office worker here, as one of the few university graduates. I sat on my desk which was arranged in conner [fm1,-] and took out an English book to read. Although there was nothing significant for me to do since I came, still I think if I wanted to do my work successfully [sn9, s]. I must enrich my knowledge. Fifteen minutes later, my colleague [np6, 1-] reached one by another. Men firstly enjoyed a cup of coffee or tea, reading newspaper. Some women took out their mirror and began to make up. Some were discussing the TV programmes showed the night before and the handsome actors excitedly. Some were just making joke with each other. The whole office was in a [wd3, -1] noise. I had to put down my book. "Boss is coming " somebody cried. The people calmed down at once and took out their work, pretending to be busy. The boss, a severe old man more than 50 years old, walked into his room, with no expression on his face. Later, he went out, gave his segretary [fm1,-]a pile of documents, ordered:" Type it! " And went back. Passing through several hands, the documents reached my desk. Though it was not my duty, I had no reason to complain---- I was a new come here. Office moved on in its usual orbit slowly. I spent the rest of the day in typing, sleeping , staring blankly and reading a lot of newspaper [np6, 1-] . But I was more tired in mind than having done a hard work. I comforted myself :"Tomorrow may be a better day !"Dear Sir, I have been considering for a long time before I write to you . But I have to say that the noise you make brings me a lot of unconvenience [fm1,-]in my daily life. I am also a music lover as you are. But I suggest weather [fm1,-] you can lower the sound of your recorder. Since I am a writer. I have to stay at home all day, contriving plots and writing them down to earn a living. A quiet condition is very important to me. And I think it is not good for your recorder to be operating all day long. Your children must be fond of sports very much. I often hear them running here and there and jumping on the floor just above my head . It makes me quite nervous, for I surpect [fm1,-1] wether [fm1,-] the floor is strong enough. Out-door activities will be better for them. I think the TV programmes in deep night must be quite interesting and I hear your laughter now and then . But most people would be tired at 12pm after a day's work. They need rest to refresh themselves to be ready for the next day's work. And a quiet environment is good for your children too. Whenever you want to quarrel with your wife , please firstly consider wether [fm1,-] it is the right time and your poor neighbor downstairs. I will be very glad if your attention can be drawn on these problems. And I look forward to the disppearance [fm1,-] of the noise. Yours sincerely,

So it is also called "The Double Fifth Holiday". This festival is well believed that is in honor of a great patriotic man in history Chuyan [fm1,-]. [sn8,s]He dropped himself in the river and someone rowed a boat to find him but in vain. So people make Zonzi [fm1,-] throwing into river for him. [sn8, s]Now, in [wd3, 1-] this festival, people always eat Zonzi [fm1,-], that is glutinous rice dumplings, and have boat races. In my hometown, we usually make Zonzi ourselves. It is shaped like a cone or some others [wd3, 1-] as you like. All of them are made together in bunches. And in the park where there is a lake, we used [vp6,s-] to have a boat race which is just a minor race for fun. Or in the river there used [vp6,s-] to be boat races. The latter is more exciting. But nowadays, no one will manage to hold a boat race. Someone [pr1, 1-] just stay at home eating Zonzi [fm1,-] or go to work as usual. Because it is not an really [wd2, 1-] holiday, schools and factories or other departments [wd3, 1-] don't close for this festival. With times go on, [sn8,s]the Dragon Boat Festival becomes more and more a convention of eating Zonzi [fm1,-] and boating than commemerating [fm1,-1] Chuyan.

Dragon Boat Festival, which is also called Double Fifth Festival, is celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month.

On this day, we also make and eat a kind of dumpling called "Zongzi", which is wrapped by lotus or bamboo leaves and stuffed by [wd6, 1-1] various ingredients, like peanuts, yolk, and so on. It is really delicious and we all like it.	I have learned from adults that this festival is observed in honor of a great ancient poet 'Quyuan'. It is said that because his reform suggestion was rejected by the emperor [sn9, s] he felt very disappointed and drawned [fm1,-] into a river. People knew this later and rawed [fm1,-] their boats to rescue him but in vain. After this, people set aside the Dragon Boat Festival to mark him[sn9,-] [sn8,s] However, in these days, I think people observe this festival more for pleasure.

[sn8,s]	Another special custom is racing dragon boat, which usually takes place in South China, especially in where I live--Guangdong Province. It is said that people race dragon boats to save Qu Yuan. However, I think nowadays, it is more a public entertainment for fun than its traditional mission of saving the great poet.	The traditional significance of the Dragon Boat Festival has gradually been lost in modern times. People simply have it as a good chance to enjoy themselves without honoring Qu Yuan.

After Qu Yuan jumped into the Mi Luo river, the local people were afraid that the creature in the river would eat him, so they made a kind of dumpling to throw into the river and said, "Please don't eat Qu Yuan, eat the food we made." This kind of dumpling is the Zongzi we call now. It's very famous and delicious. It is pyramid-shaped dumpling made of gutinurs [fm1,-]. But in fact, there are all kinds of different [wd5,4-] Zonzi [fm1,-]all over the country. When the festival comes, people will make Zonzi [fm1,-]in their family [wd3, 1-].

July 9th, 1997																	 Dear John, 	Glad to hear from you and learn something about the situation of job-hunting in Britain. And I will try to make a vivid picture of this situation in China for you.	As far as I know, this situation in China is quite different from what you've heard about. Those methods of being automatically allocated jobs by the goverment [fm1,-] have been out-of-dated. After the economic reform and the opening-door policy, we are now having less [aj3, 1-2]and less state-run factories, but more and more joint venture [np3, 1-] and foreign fund [cc1, 2-1] company [np3, s-] . As a result, school and college leavers are having more job opportunities and they no long feel satisfied about the old methods. Now they have a double-track [fm2, 1-] methods. They can either find a job themselves in the job market or choose to be appointed by the government according to their own will. But it's not easy to find a good job because more people having recieved [fm1,-]high education, which makes job-hunting full of competetion [fm1,-]. [sn7,s]Moreover, many jobs require working experience . So things are hard for them.	In a word , the situation in China and Britain are more or less the same. Now we have just 2 years to prepare for this competetion [fm1,-] and we must try hard so that we can find a good job in the future.																Yours,Yuonne

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ?1/21eDear Mary,	I'm glad to have received your letter of 5th, July. Since I'm not well informed of the situation of the job market, I just tell you what I know as much as possible.	In China, the situation of job market is not so good. Nowadays, Chinese school and college leavers are not all automatically allocated jobs by the government. After graduation, most of the leavers must find jobs themselves. Even before graduation, a lot of students go to the job market and try to "sell" themselves. Since there are a lot of competition, it is not easy to find a job. Young people in China do have problems in finding work [wd3, 1-].	Comparing [vp2, 1-] the situation in Britain, ours is not optimistic. There is a recession in some fields of the economic [wd2, 1-], and many workers lose their job. This puts much more pressure on the graduates. Like the graduates in Britain, Chinese university leavers worry about their future.	I do hope your brother can find a suitable job before long.																	Yours, Meilisa

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ???	Since China has a large population, she also encounters a problem of unemployment. Every year, a number of undergraduates are pushed to the job markets to compete for their positions. Nowadays the system of allocating jobs has been out of date since the number of applicants greatly outstrips that of the vacancy [np6, s-] for [wd5, 1-1]jobs. So those who lose the competition will have to change their direction.	Some superior [wd7, 1-] may be given posts to choose in accordance with his own will. Others need to find their jobs by themselves. Many chances are provided as long as you are competent. If you couldn't [vp6,s-] seek a job in a year, your case will be transferred to your local personnel Department which will arrange job [np6, 1-] for you. Or if you consider that you need to receive another kind of study so as to suit the situation, you can look for some nightschools or career schools. 	Finding a job is not so easy today. Our government is trying hard to provide more jobs. I think things would [vp6,s-] be better in future.

From it I know your younger brother has just left schools [np6, s-] and is looking for a job, please say good luck to him for me. 	In China, I think finding a job is much easier than in England [fm1, -1] cause China is developing quickly these years and it needs lots of personels [wd3, 1-]. You said that Chinese school and college leavers are [vp6,s-]automatically allocated jobs by the government. This is [vp6,s-] true in the past, but things have changed a lot nowadays. After several years [np4,1-1] reforming, the government now recommends jobs for college leavers and the students decide whether to get the job [np3, 1-] themselves. More students find jobs themselves, they may visit the university, they may advertise or something else. [sn8,s]When both sides are satisfied, college leavers get a job [np3, 1-]. But here are still some problems. More and more jobs need high education and skills, this cause [vp3, 1-] some young people difficult to find a job [np3, 1-] although it [pr1, 1-] is not serious. And this is what I know of China's work situation.	I hope your brother will find a good job soon.	Yours Jack.

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, o????															 July 9,1997Dear Peter,	After reading your letter, I do worry about your brother.	Here in China, the situation is not much the same as that in Britain. There are also some factories and companies which have to close because of their bad management. But because of our open-door policy, many new factories and joint-venture companies have been set up, so the unemployment here is not so serious as [sn4, s] yours.	You also mentioned in your letter that our government allocated jobs for schools and college levers. This was true in the past few years. Nowadays, there more and more people with high quality than before.[sn8,s] And most companies, of course, want to select some excellent people to work for them. So people have to compete with others in order to enter a good company. If you want to find a good job, you must have not only high quality, but top quality. Otherwise, you will have to find a job inferior to others [np4, 1-]. On the other hand, governments do allocate jobs for people. There are so many poor area [np3, 3-] in our country. They need to be constructed. If people are willing to work in these areas, the government can arrange work of [wd3, 3-] them.	I think you have had some brief knowledge of the job situation in China, and I hope that your brother will find a job soon.																 Yours,												         He Yupeng

I feel sorry about your brother's problem. I fact, nowaday [fm1,-] we Chinese school and college leavers have to look for their [pr1, 1-] own jobs too. The government will provide information and necessary services to help. But it depends on ourselves to find a satisfactory job. Just like your brother, Chinese young man also faces the threat of unemployment. That may be a side-effect of our country's reform. But on the other hand, we now have much more freedom to choose and have more choices. I would suggest that unemployment is a common problem to all the youth all around the world. What we could [vp6,s-] do is to try and wait, till we find a proper job. At the same time, develope [fm1,-]our own ability. When we are qualificated [fm1,-] to a job, the opportunity will come.	Please take [cc3,1-4] my best wish to your brother. Surely he will get a job, sooner or later. Best wishes to you, too. 												Yours, peter[fm3,-]

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ?1/21/4Dear friend,	The employment situation in China is also serious. As you may know, China has the largest population in the world, so it is impossible that everyone can find a job. China is still a developing country, and there are not so many factories or companies to meet the employment requirement. So there is also quite a few people idling on the street and have no job at all. [sn8,s]	In the past, the Chinese school and college leavers are [vp6,s-] all allocated jobs by the government. But now things have changed. Job-seeking have alternative choices. [sn8,s] They can find jobs through school job-finding agencies or get jobs by going to the labor market or even some make bosses themselves. [sn8,s]	Young people nowadays have some problems finding work [wd3, 1-] in China. As for as I know, some graduates are still out of work, they must wait for an unknown time to find jobs. They make the best use of their efforts to fight with each other in order to earn jobs. Some get jobs through their relatives or friends , some even go to the "back door" . So there are still some problems finding jobs in China, we keep in our minds that to get jobs we must use various means as we can.	I hope this information above can be helpful for you.

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ?3/4y															July 9, 1997 Dear Billy,	I am glad that I have the chance to tell you something about how the graduates from university and school find jobs in China.	As you mentioned, it was true that school and college leavers are [vp6,s-] all automatically allocated jobs by the government in the past. In China, the intuition [wd7, 1-1] fee was paid by government, therefore, the government has [vp6,s-] the right to assign jobs to the graduates. You may find out the drawback of the system, that was [vp6,s-], the graduates always were not assigned the suitable jobs according to their situation. Things are changed by educational reform [wd4, s] recent year [np6, 3-]. Now, students pay for their study themselves and they determine their jobs themselves. Graduates enter the job market to find jobs according to their qualification and situation. Since more and more people can offer the intuition [wd7, 1-1] fee, graduates have heavier social pressure, one is that they face fiece [fm1,-] competition for finding a job, the other is that the jobs are not adequate. Finding a decent job is more difficult than [sn4, s]usual. And this forces students work harder to meet the need to [pp1, 1-] society and win in the job-hunting competition. I think it is a good tendency.	I hope what I say above can help you understand the situation in China. And if you have any question, do write back to ask me . Best Wishes [fm3, 1-2] to You.															Yours Sincerely Scarlett

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ?aD??t															July, 9, '97Dear X ,	So glad to hear form you and I am pleased to answer your questions.	You've heard that Chinese school and college leavers are all automatically allocated by the government. It used to be true. But it belongs to the past now. In order to meet the market's actual need, the Chinese government now let [vp3, 4-] the students choose their favorite jobs and accordingly, give the comanies [fm1,-] a chance to select suitable pannels [wd7, 1-] they need. Though this policy enable [vp3, 1-] job hunters and companies to be satisfied with each other, the more and more competitive job market makes the situation harder and harder. There are too many job hunters while too few chances. [sn7,s]If you are a college undergraduates [np6, 2-], it will not be too hard to find a relative satisfying job as long as you try your best. But if you are an unskilled person, or have not received much education, it will become very hard to find a good job. And the situation seems to get harder and harder in recent years.	Owing to the harder situation, we , Chinese college students, have to study very hard in order to have a higher [aj1, 1-1] chance to get a good job after graduation.	Well, have to stop now. Looking forward to hearing from you.															Yours Morley

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ?a?3/4Dear friend,													July, 9, 1997	In reply to your questions mentioned in your last letter, I would put them [pr1, 1-] this way.	Talking about the situation of employment in China, I would have to say it is no better than [wd6, -1] than in Britain. Workers in state-owned enterprises used to be regarded to have the most secure jobs in the world. But with the opening up policy and economic reforms going on, Many unprofitable state-run factories were included in the closing-down list. Few of their workers can go elsewhere but home. My mother used to an accountant in a state-run factory, [sn8,s] but now she is employed at home as full time housewife because the factory came to the an end. Generally speaking, workers are aboundant [fm1,-] now in the job market.	With such big climate, the opportunity to find a job, especially good job is not [wd3, -1] optimistic. It is even worse for a college leaver. It is true that college leavers used to be allocated a job by the government. But it is a thing of the past. Nowadays the college can only give recommedation [fm1,-] to certain companies, whether you can get it depends on your competitive capital [wd7, 1-]. Without excellent qualification, it is hard to find a good job. It is not uncommon that what you have learned will not fit in your future job. It is also not uncommon that you have to wander around the job market for some time before you find a suitable job.	Dispite [fm1,-] this situation, it is true that if you have attractive qualities, a lot of good jobs are waiting for you .

I'm sorry to hear about the difficult situation of your younger brother. In China, the situation is [wd4, s] difficult.	You know, China is a populous country, so the state give [vp3, 1-] many oppotunities [fm1,-] of work. However, some inexperienced and uneducated people still have difficulty in finding a job. For school and college leavers, the situation is better . These years, the government do [vp3, 1-] not allocate jobs for school leavers but they are optimistic, because they have knowledge in a certain field. Especially colledge [fm1,-] students, [sn8,s]they will usually be fit for their jobs in the future after four or five years study in the universities . Nowadays, college students are popular with many companies and they have a lot of choice [np3, 3-]. For example, English learners can work in a bank, factory and school. So they can choose the job they like. Now, you can see that it's easier to look for a job in China. 	I hope your younger brother will find a job soon and I look forward to hearing from you. 																Yours, Mai Gang

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, oT															July 9th, 1997Dear Rose, 	I am so happy to hear from you. Thank you for telling me all about the employment situation in Britain.	[sn2,s] Compared to [pp1, 1-] Britain, [sn4, s]the unemployemnt [fm1,-] rate in China is lower. Every year, all kinds of companies and factories badly need the graduates. So they went [vp6,s-] to the universities to select the excellent graduates that they need at the moment. It is no longer the case the college leavers are automatically allocated jobs by the government. If a student has good marks and he is good at dealing with people, his opportunity to be chosen by a good company is much [wd3, -1]higher than any other ordinary one. In a whole, the chance of looking for a job is equal to everyone, and everyone can have equal choice about the job they do. In fact, however, some of the graduates can't find a job after they leave school. So they have to resolve this problem by themselves.	I hope your younger brother can find a job at last. Good luck to him!															Yours sincerely, Liang Wei

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ?D?o																																			9,7, 1997.Dear Mary,	I'm glad to answer your questions in your last letter.	In China, the government takes many measures to decrease [vp2, 1-] the unemployment. After the open-door policy, the government courage [wd2, 1-] the foreign and domestic investment to develop in China. They build up many new factories and companies, and provide many positions to people. But some of the positions need a lot of skills and experiences, so it is true that the unexperienced [fm2, -] young people are difficult to find jobs. However, in order to get the kills [fm1,-] and experiences, many young people go to the professional schools and take some courses, part of them go to university after high school to get higher education.[sn1,s] After they get the skills and knowledge, it is easier to take a position. Some years ago the college leavers even could automatically allocat [fm1,-] jobs by the government but in [wd5, 1-] nowadays, it is not the fact. [sn8,s]Because the old system was not effective, many students could not get a job connected with what they learned. Now, the situation is changed. After the students graduate, they must depend on themselves to find a job. There are many ways, for instance, they can go to the job market, or they can read the ads on the newspaper, some even can find a job through relation net . [sn1,s]However, it is still a bit hard for students to get a position they real like.	 I hope that my letter could [vp6,s-] help you to know about the jobs [cc1, 1-1] situation in China and get some ideas about it.																Angel

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, 23t"a																July 9,1997Dear Penfriend,	I am sorry to hear about the difficult employment situation in Britain. But I have to admit that the employment situation in China is also not optimistic in recent years.	Oweing [fm1,-] to China's open-up policy, things have changed a lot since 1978. School and college leavers are not automatically allocated jobs by the government generally [ad1, 1-] as they used to be. They can choose their own jobs on their own wills. Some would rather stay in their hometowns, Others [fm3, 1-] would swarm to the coastal areas or some economically rapidly developed areas for higher salaries and brighten [wd2, 1-] promotion opportunity, still others would like to set up their own business.	Work units have also their choices for recruiting personnels [np5, 1-]. They require graduates with skill, high technology or even all-round knowledge. This employment system, that is, graduates choosing work units and work units choosing graduates [sn9, s] is called double-choose [fm2, 1-] system. School and college leavers have more choices than they used to have and work units have more choices and higher demand as well. It will stimulate the leavers to improve themselves by consolidating and widening their knowledge and the work units to improve themselves by providing better working condition and welfare.	Those school leavers who are not qualifed [fm1,-] enough are in a tough position to find a job and those who have got a job are still in danger of being rejected by their work units . So only strongers [fm2, 1-] surviving in modern society still takes effect. [sn8,s]Though the situation in Britain might be different from that in China, there are still some similarities I think you can learn from. [sn2, s]	I look forward to hearing good news that your brother gets a good job.																Yours sincerely Flowe J

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, 2?																9th, JulyDear X X,	 I received your letter yesterday, in which you talked about the working situation in Britain. I think the situation in China is better than it is in Britain. Most of the school and college leavers can find a job. 	It was true that school and college leavers were automatically allocated jobs by the government. But the case is changed. Nowadays, after graduation, students will not be given a job by the government. They have to find a job by themselves. They will look a [wd5, 1-] at ads on the newspaper or billboard and apply for a job he [pr1, 1-] desires. Then there will be a [np7, 1-] interview if he is considered. And of course he will be given the job if he is competent for it. So students have free options for their job. They can choose their job according to their own interesting [wd2, 1-] and ability. And finding a job like a competition. [sn8,s] If they want to get a good job they have to enrich their ability and have some special skill. I can't deny that some students can't find a job in a long time. But I think, general [wd2, 1-] speaking, if you are good enough, there will be no problem for you to find a job.	I hope you can get a brief idea of the situation in China and I hope your brother can find a job soon.																Yours sincerely Winly

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, 1/2-?t?1/4Dear X X,	When I heard that your younger brother was quite hard to find a job in British [wd2, 1-], [sn8,s]I was sorry about that. In China, the situation for finding a job is also [wd7, -1] critic. Because now our country are [vp3, 1-] developing market economy, and a number of companies close down, so that will cause quite a lot of unemployments [np5, 1-]. Even these [pr1, 1-] who have a job do not feel safe about their work, because now the world is developing too fast (for example, the usage of computer), and all the people must keep learning and studying so as to make them qualified to [wd3,2-2] the job. If they are not qualified to [wd3,3-2] the job, they will lose their work. 	You said that Chinese school and college leavers are all automatically allocated jobs by the government. That was the situation of 10 years ago. Nowadays, Guduated [fm1,-] students have to find jobs themselves. They read newspapers, go to jobmarket or [sn6, s] through other mediums to find jobs. For them, maybe it's good to have more choice [np6, 1-] for a job. But some of them can not find a job immediately and have to stay at home and have nothing to do.	Nowadays, young people to find a good job depends on their abilities and certificates. [sn8,s] But experiences are quite a problem for young people, especially those students who just graduate. But in general most of them can find a chance to show their abilities.	Above are [vp3,-2] the situation of finding a job in China that I know. What do you think of that ? I hope to hear from you soon.														  Yours truly

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ???T1/4																July 9, 1997Dear Joan,	I am glad to have received your letter! From the letter I know that your brother has been looking for a job and you also want to know the job situation in China. I am interested in talking about this to you.	In the past, it was true that most Chinese school and college leavers were automatically allocated jobs by the government. But the situation has changed nowadays. It is as difficult for the Chinese people to find jobs as the people in Britain do. Especially for the young people without experience. [sn2,s] In China, usually there are two ways for the young people to look for jobs. One is to depend on the recommondations [fm1,-] of schools or colleges, the other is to find jobs by themselves. To the recommondations [fm1,-], if they like they can have these recommodations [fm1,-]; [sn8,s] if not, they can have their own free choice. That is to say, they can choose the jobs they like. But to have free choice, they have to make their best efforts to get employed by themselves. 	I am looking forward to your letter next time! And I also I hope that your brother can find a good job soon!															yours [fm3, 1-], Lancy

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ? ? 	When college students in China graduate, they used to get their jobs assigned to them by a certain official department. And so students could avoid the trouble of finding a job. But they also had their troubles. Chances were that they might not like the jobs they were assigned to and sometimes they might even be assigned to a job which was not suitable for their expertacy [fm2, 1-]. It sometimes could happen that a student majored in chemistry was alloted [fm1,-] to a trade company to do business! This kind of assignments, of course would not satisfy either the students or the employers.	But things have changed now. Students nowadays will not be alloted [fm1,-] a job when they leave schools. Instead, they will go into the job market and apply for the jobs which they like . In this way of 'Mutual [fm3, 1-] selection", both students and employers can freely have their choices and both can be satisfied.

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ??D July 9, 1997Dear Mary, 	I am very glad to hear from you. In your letter, I know something about the situation of employment in Britain. I think, the issue of unemployment in the world exists nowadays. Now I will tell you the situation in China.	Up to few years ago, Chinese school and college leavers are [vp6,s-] automatically allocated jobs by the governments. In [pp1, 1-] that time this method to an extend [wd2, 1-] actually do [vp6,s-]good to our society. And students do [vp6,s-] not need to worry about their jobs. However, with the development of economy, this policy is not suitable now. Students have to find their jobs themselves. They find jobs which they like or be suitable for them. [sn8,s]In this case, on one hand, students will have good qualifities [fm1,-] for jobs. On the other hand, they have to compete with others. There are, inevitably, some people can not find a job. [sn8,s]According to what I have seen in recent years, most of college students are able to find jobs. Some students will even quit the jobs they just find and to [wd5, 1-] seek another. They are not just like somebodies [fm2,-] who just what to hold down a job. [sn8,s]In all, I think college students in China mostly can find a job without problems if they have knowledge and qualities. Young people who have not good education will have problems finding work.	Above is a brief description about employment, I hope you can know a few [pr6, 1-] from it.

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, o?"aDear Peter,	I am very glad to receive your letter. In your letter, you introduced some information of finding jobs in Britain, [sn9, s]and the condition of your younger brother.	Compare with your country, China also has the problem--unemployment. [sn8,s] Nowadays, more and more peasants come into the cities, while the factories only need a certain number of workers. So definitely, there will be a lot of people who have difficulties to find jobs. Furthermore, the modern society needs the workers who have skills and knowledges [np5, 1-]. As a result, the people who have less [wd3, 1-1]technology will have the difficulties to find suitable jobs. Finally, it is not true that Chinese school and college leavers are all automatically allocated jobs by the government. Now, Most [fm3, 1-] of the colleges have reforms. The students basically find jobs by themselves. But the government can help them to find jobs when the students have some difficulties.	So there are a lot of differences between Chinese and British to find jobs. The people must depend on themselves, use their skills and knowledge to find suitable jobs.	I wish your brother to find a good job.	Best wishes to you.																Yours sincerely Angela

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, D"3/43/4																																			July, 9th, 1997Dear Joan:	I am very glad to hear from you again. But I'm not sure if I can give satisfactory answers to your questions. I will try my best.	Comparing with Britain, there is no such serious unemployment in China. As you know, China is developing quite quickly in recent years. There are always new enterprises [cc1,-] set, so there are always chances for work. The problem that many youth [wd2, 1-] people have to face while finding a job, is to get a good job rather ran just a job. It needs to have certifications, experiences and sometimes to go to "back doors" to get a good job. [sn8,s]	Our government did arrange jobs for college leavers before. But there has been a big revolution in college systems these years. The government set a new job choosing system, we call it a "bi-sides [fm2, 1-] choosing system". That means the enterprises can choose their employees and the college leavers can choose their bosses. The contract will be signed only when the two sides are both satisfied.																Yours faithfully Christina

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, D ?Dear friend:	I'm very pleased to hear from you and I would like to tell you about the situation in China.	Nowadays the competition in China's markets is very keen and school and college leavers do have difficulties finding a job. You see, even a person who has got a job will probably lose his job, if he is found to not [ad1, 1-] qualified [fm1,-] the job any more or the company he belongs to fails in the competition. So he has to find a [wd5, 1-] another job to making a living. [sn8,s]In that case, school and college leavers find it harder to work, because they have more competitions now and they are lack of experience.	In fact, less than ten years ago, I seldom heard such problems in China. Just as you said, school and college leavers were all automatically allocated jobs by goverment [fm1,-]. But all this has passed. at [fm3, 1-]the present, our college students know the hardship of finding a job [np3, 1-] and study extremely hard. However, this change is a very good thing since we can have more flexible choice of jobs according to our own interests and expertise.														  Yours sincerely, Helen

China July, 9, 1997Dear Tom, 	I am sorry to hear that your younger brother has difficulty in finding a job. Compared to Britain [sn4, 1-], the situation in China is a little better. Our country is developing very fast, and there are great needs for all kinds of skillful workers and learned techicians [fm1,-]. in [fm3, s-]the past, the development of economy is [vp6,s-] planned by the government. So Chinese school and college leavers are [vp6,s-] all automatically allocated jobs by the government. But nowadays, such way of distributing worforce [fm1,-] is old fashioned and not practical. After graduation from school, students have to find jobs for themselves, just like in the western world.	However, young people in China also have problems finding jobs. Many factors----employers' demands, appliants' [fm1,-] qualifications, competition etc [sn9, s], lead to unemployment. In order to find a good job, a young man should be learned, skillful and experienced. 	I hope your brother will find a good job soon and have a merry Christmas.															Yours faithfully, Alex

In your letter, you talked about a serious problem--unemployment. As you may know, China is an agricultural country with a majority of peasants. [sn8,s] Managing to make a balance of agriculture, industry and commercial in recent years, China has made a great success. With the development of economy, many peasants discard their own work and turn to commercial [wd2, 1-] in the belief that it can bring them larger sums of money. It's rather a problem. Compared [sn4, s] with Britain, unemployment is also a serious problem in China. Because of the economic reforms in China, many state-owned enterprises have to lay off many workers or reduce their salary. As there are not so many jobs available, many people have to go into business or join the private-run companies.	It's true that the school and college leavers are [vp6,s-] automatically allocated by the government in the past, but it's not the case today with the reform of two-way choice system. The companies can choose the suitable personnel and at the same time, students can also choose what companies they interested in, which makes the job-hunting more compititive [fm1,-] .[sn7,s] Only those who are really capable of the job would be chosen. But I think it's a good thing because it can stimulate the students to study harder.	Could you give me some ideas of the job-hunting in Britain, especially the young people?															Yours truthly [fm1,-], Chenliqiang

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ??	China has its own difficulties in its job markets. First of all, due to its large population, people nowaday [fm2,-] usually can not easily find a good job; you have to excel in many aspects. The government, however, is trying its best to solve this problem. Job is always available, although it may not be a good one.	It was true that jobs were assigned to school and college leavers years ago and in some special schools, at present, students are still not allowed to choose jobs they want. But most graduates from other colleges surely can choose their own careers. There are many job-hunting fairs for graduats [fm1,-] organised [fm1,-] by colleges and other communities. it [fm3, 1-] is still not easy to find a good job in such kind of activities; many students begin to worry and try to find a job by themselves or by help of their relatives or other social relation, far before they actually leave colleges.	Young people nowaday [fm1,-], have come to realize that they must work hard in school in order to avoid embarrassment of being rejected in personal [wd3, 1-] market.

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, 1/2-??																July 9, 1997Dear Tom, 	I'm very happy to receive your letter. Though I don't know much about the job market, I'd like to tell you what I know.	Every nation's situation is different, so is the job market. Nowadays, our economy is developing rapidly. As a result, the opportunities for people to find jobs are more than [sn4, s] yours. Similarly, our heavy industry is also facing obstacles. Because of the reform policy, some workers will lose their jobs. But here are thousands of newly emerged enterprises which can offer works [wd3, 1-] . So, the unemployment rate is very low.	What you heard about the graduates are [vp3, 6-] not wrong. But things have changed a lot. Now a new method called "bilateral-selected [fm2, 1-]" is in force, which means not only the employees can choice [wd2, 1-] our graduate [np6, s-], but also our graduate [np6, s-] can choice [wd2, 1-] employees. Through [pp1, 1-] this way, most graduates can find ideal work and the enterprises can also find ideal graduates.	In conclusion, as far as you do have capability, finding a [np7, 1-2] idea job in China is not a problem at all.	I'm not sure whether you are satisfied with my answers. Looking forward to hearing from you again.																Yours David Wang

You said it was not easy in Britain to find a job, the situation in China now is as grim as that in Britain.	China has the largest population in the world. The over population brings about a lot of problems . Unemployment is a very serious one. Lots of people can't find jobs now, including the student [np6, s-] graduated from school.	Before, in 1980's, the students graduating were all automatically allocated jobs by goverment [fm1,-] according to the polictics [fm1,-] then. Now, the govermnet [fm1,-] does not act in that way; it just provides suggestions to the graduaters [fm2, 1-] and help [vp3, 1-] them to find jobs. As to what kind job the students want to get, it is up to themselves, up to what their professions are, and what kind of skills they learn in colleges. It is more often now that students go out to find jobs themselves. [sn8,s] The enterprices [fm1,-] have rights to select them, they also have rights to choose the factories or departments. So, you can see that the situation is very different now from that in China before. The situation I can give you more it you have any other doubts in following letter.

[sn1,s]Now that most of the current graduates from my university have virtually obtained jobs by far, I think the situation in China is fairly optimistic now. And I believe I have to make it clear that things have changed in China. Nowadays Chinese school and college leavers are not necessarily automatically allocated jobs by the goverment [fm1,-]. In another [wd3, 1-] word, people have their own choice about the jobs and actually they may visit the personnel market, "sell" themselves and get suitable jobs. All in all, with the development of Chinese economy there are more and more jobs available for young people who have received propriate [fm1,-] training and education.	I hope your brother will be lucky to find a good job. I'm expecting your further letter telling me the good news. 													Yours ever, Shen Yanmin

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, o?TDear  ,	I'm glad to get your letter. What you said in your letter cause [vp3, 1-] me to think a lot about the situation in China.	Compared with Britain, [sn4, s]the situation in China is the same grim. [sn8,s] As you know, China has a big population, so it is impossible for everyone to have a job. And the thing becomes more and more [aj3, 1-1]worse today. In some places, because a lot of factories close down, a large amount [wd3, 1-] of people can't find a job. The situation as you said, that Chinese school and college leaver are [vp6,s-] all automatically allocated jobs by the government was really existed in the past. [sn8,s] Our government used to arrange jobs for the leavers, according to the need of our country's development. Usually the students would take the arranged jobs, but they did have choice [np3, 1-] to get a job [np3, 1-] as [wd5, 1-] they liked.	Nowaday [fm2,-], however, this policy has [vp7, -1] be abolished. The government won't arrange any job for you. You have to find a job by yourself. And many students find that it become harder and harder to get a good job. I think , in the future, we will meet the same problem.

From your letter, I know something about the job situation in your country, that [pr5, 1-] is not optimistic. Now, I'll give you some information about our job opportunities.	You know China has the largest poputalion [fm1,-] in the world, but its economic [wd2, 1-] is not very developed. Like many countries in the world, many people in China are not easy to find a job. [sn8,s] It is right that before the college reforms [vp6,s-], we colleges students never worried to have a job, [sn8,s] because the colleges would allocate jobs for us . Nowadays, with the development of the society, many reforms put forward in the universities. [sn8,s]The government will not arranged jobs for you when you graduate. We have to compete with other people in the society to get a job. With so many graduates in recent years, young people face a lot of problems in finding a job since they are lack of experiences or their majors are not fit for the company. So sometimes, they have no choice but do everything they can do, even they are reluctant to do that.	I'm expecting for your letter again. YoursLydia Zhu

As you mentioned the unemployment in your country, I would like to say something about employment in China.	In the past, most of the university students, as you had mentioned in your letter, were automatically allocated jobs by the government. But with the development of economy and competition introducing [aj4, 1-] in every company and factory, more and more companies would like to choose employees on their own will. Likewise, students are free to select jobs which are suitable for their capability. Now, most personnel fair presents the principal of "Selet [fm1,-] the better' as their criteria to find a [np7, 1-] adapted [wd7, 1-] employee. Of course, under this principal, some students are dropped out because of insufficient skill and knowledge. However, in general, I think it is good for both society and students. First, the society can have talent [wd2, 1-] people to serve it. In turn, it helps to develop the economy of a country. Second, it brings competitive ideas into the youth's mind and promotes them to bring their initiative into full play. In order not to be left out, they have to [wd4, s] the upmost [fm1,-]to qualify their knowledge and skills.

E95 Class2 The English Department Guangdong University of Foreign Studies Huangshi Road The People's Republic of China July 9, 1997Dear Lily:	I'm glad to receive your letter, [sn9, s] today.  You asked me about the employment situation in China, and I must tell you that although we have some problems here, generally speaking, unemployment is not very serious.	Different from the situation in Britain, most unemployed people age 40--50 in China. [sn8,s] Because [wd6, 1-] due to the open-and-reform policy, China has developed extremly [fm1,-] fast recently. Many old factories had to close down because of the lack of advanced techology [fm1,-] and well-educated workers. So the old people without special knowledge had to be fired. But it was [vp6,s-] not the case in young people.	Compared with the college students in Britain, China [wd2, 1-] college leavers are luckier. Nowadays, not all the students are automatically allocated jobs by the government [sn9, s] just some of them, such as students at normal school, are allocated by the government. We ourselves have many choices depended on our own will. [sn8,s] The system which we undertake now is called "bi-choose [fm2, 1-]" system. That means we can choose the companies, and the companies can come to school to choose students as well. If a student was [vp6,s-] not chosen by a state-owned enterprise, he could [vp6,s-] go to find a job in a private-owned enterprise.	Of course, we do have some problems, for example, there are more and more graduates now. [sn1,s]But I'm sure after the government's reform policy is put forward, and if I really have quality, finding a job after graduation is not so difficult.	I do hope your brother can find a satisfactory job in the coming future. I'm looking forward to his good news. Good Luck!															Yours, Daphne

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ?o	As far as I know, young people in our country are facing no lesser [aj3, 1-] problems in finding jobs than those in Britain. Nowadays jobs are not easy to come by because of the large number of college graduates and the comparatively small number of vacant positions.	Here in China job assignment for college leavers is arranged in a mutual-choice way. It is hoped that students themselves can find suitable jobs of their own choices in the first place. Either they go to job markets to hunt work they see fit, or they go through connection to secure a lucrative job. Therefore, jobs acquired this way usually agree with the wills and interests of the college leavers. Then if a college graduate fails to get a job on his own, the government will be responsible for allocating a job for him. More often than not the student is assigned back to where he has come from, and it's not up to him to decide which work unit to go into in this case. Such is the job-seeking situation in China. I hope it can be of some help to you.

July 9, 1997Dear friend, 	I received your letter recently, and I would like to tell [vp1, 1-] as much as possible what I know of the present employment situation in China.	In the past there was indeed a period of time when students were all automatically allocated jobs by the government. However, the situation is different now. College leavers have to find jobs on their own, while at the same time companies can choose potential employees freely. This results in two extremely different feelings, because some students can find jobs whereas others have great difficulty. As a matter of fact, since nowadays the economic development isn't so fast as in the past few decades, it has been more uneasy for a young job-seeker without work experience to find a desirable job.	Anyway, things are looking up gradually. We are all looking forward to a brighter future when more posts will be available to college graduates.														Yours sincerely, Chen Yue Min

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, "?oo	Comparing [vp7, 1-]with your country , [sn4, s]the situation in China is no better than yours in recent years. Because of cultivation and renewal in factories and comanies [fm1,-], more and more workers lose their job and it's harder of young people to find a job. [sn8,s]Several years [wd4, s], it's [vp6,s-] true that graduates from colleges or vocational schools were all automatically allocated jobs by the government. At that time, unemployment was not a big problem of society. But nowadays, since the requirement for employees is much higher and the so-called 'iron bowl' has been broken, even some college leavers have problems finding a proper job [np3, 1-], not to say others who didn't receive such high-educations [np5, 1-].	On the other hand, people can choose the job they like instead of being assigned by government. That means you have more options. In the competitive job markets, a job hunter must depend on himself [wd5, 1-] his knowledge and social capacity.	In the future, we believe, with the development of our country's economy, there will be more eccess [fm1,-] and opportunity [np6, 1-] in job markets.

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ?T															July 9, 1997Dear friend,	I'm glad to receive your letter. I'm sorry to hear that your younger brother has not managed to find a job.	With reference of your questions, I'd like to give you some brief idea about the situation in China. In the past, the Chinese school and college graduates were automatically allocated jobs by the government. The students were not worried if they could find a job after their graduation. [sn8,s] Nowadays, things have changed. The government carries out a policy that is called "two-sides [fm2, 1-]" choice. It means that the companies or enterprises can choose employees while graduates also have right to choose their bosses. Of course, this policy cause [vp3, 2-] some problems for young people. If you are good-educated and capatable [fm1,-], you can find a good job. But if you just pass the time during school-life, looking for work will be more difficult. Generally speaking, in today's developed society, finding a good job and obtaining a bright prosperity depend on people's higher education and capability.	I look forward to hearing from you soon.														 Yours sincerely, Vera, Long

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>,?a??															9th,	July, 1997Dear Joan,	I'm glad to receive your letter. As regards the questions you put to me I will tell you what I've known about the situation in China.	It has become a thing of the past that Chinese college leavers are [vp6,s-] automatically allocated jobs by the government. Nowadays they face almost the same situation as the most college leavers in Western countries. They have to seek their ideal jobs in the personnel market, directly contact the companies they would like to work in and go into several interviews before they are actually accepted by the companies. So they have more freedom in choosing the jobs they do, but also have to outshine their opponents in the competition with a view to obtaining the satisfactory jobs. Therefore, presently most college students try to develop themselves in a variety of aspects in the college to survive the future [wd1, 1-] keen competition.	If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to ask me. Yours sincerely,Wu xianchen [fm3, 1-]

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ??o?T	I'm sorry to know that you are anxious with your brother's job searching and I hope things in your country will become better.	Things have changed greatly in China. As a result, most Chinese school and college leavers must find jobs by themselves, according to their own wills . As you know, China's economy is developing very quickly and many jobs are available. So to find a job for living is comparably easy. The problem is whether you can find a job to fully realize your self-value. [sn8,s]If you cannot, it is called semi-unemployment in our country.	With the return of Hongkong to China, it is supposed that more cooperations [np5, 1-] will be made between Hongkong and mainland. And I think the situation will be better when I graduate in 1999. Perhaps you may recommend your brother to find a job in China, which is becoming a more and more popular way for foreign youths to find jobs.

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ?	For many years, when China was still applying planning economic system, most of the school and college leavers were automatically allocated jobs by the government. At that time, the students needn't worry about their future at all. But at the same time, people had no chance to choose the job they were interested in, they had to take the job they were offered. Most of them were sent to the state-run factories or companies and sticked [wd7, 1-] to their positions for the whole life.	However, things have changed a lot when China began to carry out marketing economic system .The government release [vp6,s-] the responsibility of finding jobs for graduates. Since more and more private companies and joint-ventures are established, people have more opportunities to choose the jobs they like. Even reforms have taken place in state-run factories, people can not stay for all his [pr1, 1-] life due to this abilities [wd7, 1-]. So more and more young people find difficulties in job-hunting , especially those who have low-education and no experience. Even those who have found a job have to worry about how long they can keep their work.

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ?T??Y															July 9, 1997Dear Peter,I'm sorry to hear that your brother in facing a problem of getting a job. [sn8,s] But don't worry too much, things surely will go up .Actually, unemployment is also a big problem in my country. Of course, the situation here is a little different from yours. On one hand, a number of state-owned enterprises closed down since they failed in competition after open economic policy being carried out, many workers have to find a job elsewhere;[sn7,s] on the other hand, the job market has a great potential of seeking artificial [wd7, 1-] labor forces as my country develops. So , chances of getting a job or losing it exist a [fm1,-] the same time. The way as you called it "automatically allocated jobs by the government" has been the past. [sn8,s]Nowadays students have free choice [np6, 1-] and in fact it mainly depends on themselves to make a choice and get a job in high competition though the universities may recommend them to the society according to their abilities. Of course, the latter only lays [fm1,-] a minor role. Jobs are really hard to come by for the graduates with no experience, so a lot of young people here are facing the same problem as your brother is in Britain.I wish all the best to you and your brother.Yours faithfully, Luo Liuni

From your letter I know that your younger brother has [vp6, -1] graduate and started to look for a job. I wish him good luck.	As for the employment situation in China, I think it is a little bit difficult subject. Yes, Chinese graduates are [vp6,s-] all automatically allocated jobs by the government before. But now China's educational system , especially the high [aj3, 1-] educational system , is changing. The graduates have more and more freedom to make their own choice. It is also difficult for Chinese young people to find a job. In recent years government has been enforcing the renovation project in state-owned enterprises. Many workers were [vp6,s-]laid off. And also China wants to control the inflation and cool of [fm1,-] slightly [ad1, 1-] the economic development. All this make [vp3, 2-] our graduates more difficult to find a job as soon as they leave school.	Let's wish your brother and all graduates both in China and Britain good luck.	Yours sincerely	Zheng Hua

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ?3D?3/4														July 9, 1997Dear John,	I'm glad to hear from you, but I'm sorry to hear that you have something to worry about.	Compared with Britain, [sn4, s] Chinese youths have a similar situation in finding a job. Also, quite a few [pr6, 1-] percent of Chinese graduates are unemployed. Similarly, many [wd1, 1-1]our national heavy industry factories are facing problems and difficulties. Many workers have lost their jobs.	For the college leavers, in the old days, the government allocate [vp6,s-] jobs to them indeed. However, they often find [vp6,s-] themselves doing an unsuitable job assigned to them. For example, a student who graduates [vp6,s-] from a machinery college sometimes will [vp9, 1-] be assigned to be a teacher because there is [vp6,s-] no machinery factory in his hometown. So he has [vp6,s-]to quit and runs [vp6,s-] everywhere to find a suitable job. Nowadays, innovations have taken place in the educational system. Most of the graduates look for their jobs themselves. Though it is still not easy for them to get to work, it has [vp6, -1] save much of the government's efforts.	Anyway, I hope your brother can find a job soon and both of you will have a happy Christmas.															Yours sincerely David

July, 9 , 1997Dear Tom,	I'm glad to receive your letter, and it's my pleasure to tell you something about the situation of looking for jobs in China.	In 1980s the college leavers were all automatically allocated jobs by the government. But nowadays, under the open-door policy, the situation is changed. The college leavers look for jobs by themselves. But sometimes the college will recommend some top students to some companies. Every year the college will hold a meeting between companies and college leavers, creat [fm1,-] a choice for college leavers to find a job. Most of the college leavers will go to job market to look for a job, or get a job through relationship [sn6, s] and relatives.	Nowadays, it is more and more difficult to find a job. As you know, China has a large population, so many people want to have a job. Moreover, the company's demand is strict. They require that the employee must have many kinds of skill [np6, 3-]. So they [sn9, s] the college students must study hard.	But if you have the willingness to work and do not mind what kind of job it is, I think, it is not very difficult to find a job. [sn8,s]	Above is what I know about the situation of looking for jobs in China, I hope it can help you to compare the situation with [sn4, s]Britain.

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ?o																July 9th,1997 Dear Jacky,	I was very glad to get your letter yesterday. I read it very anxiously. And I thought about your questions. Now I'll try to give some answers to you.	In China, unemployment is not a very surprising thing. Since ten years of economic system revolution.[sn2,s] Chinese people have known their job is no longer fixed at all. Everybody might be fired. To find a job nowadays is really difficult, especially a job with high salary and good contition [fm1,-].	And it is true that Chinese school and college leavers can get jobs automatically. But this is arranged by the government. Every student should obey government's arrangement, or he will lose his job. But recently, the situation is [vp6,s-] changed. The students can also find job [np6, 1-] themselves if there is some company want you. [sn8,s]If you can not find a job, government can provide you one, but you have no choice then.	Even though, [sn7,s] there are many students who cannot find a job every year or be arranged with a job out of his specialism [wd7, 1-]. what [fm3, 1-] a pity.	Two years later, it will be my turn to face these problems. So from [pp1, 1-] last years [np6, 3-], I've been ready to negotiate with some companies. I did some part-time jobs with them in the summer and winter vocations. I hope I can get job in one of these companies.	I wish your brother can find his job early.	Yours faithfully,													Daniel

Now I'll try to answer your questions in the letter.	About young people's finding jobs after they've left school, I think China does not have the same situation as Britain. [sn8,s] I think in general, they are not so difficult in finding a job if they have received education especially if they have gone to high school. [sn8,s] Because of the economic reform in China, more chances for people's finding a job have been created. [sn8,s]	It's the fact that Chinese school and college leavers used to be allocated jobs by the government. But now that is not the case. Now school and college leavers can find jobs by themselves according to their won interests and the subjects they've concerned about in school and college. Of course, some problems exist in some youth's finding jobs. Because of some reasons they can not find a satisfied [aj4, 1-] job for themselves immediately. Generally, the situation in China is quite good.	I quite understand your feelings. And I hope your younger brother can find a perfect job soon.															Yours sincerely, Lena

I am sorry to know that your younger brother does [vp6,s-]not find a job, yet. Yes, nowadays it's difficult to find a good job.	In China the situation is bad, too . Unemployment is still a problem in our country. In the past years, the school and college leavers were automatically allocated jobs by the government. But the policy caused a lot of bad effects . For example, some university graduates were sent to some enterprises where they could not use their relevant knowledge completely. The policy need to be changed. Now some of the graduates can be allocated jobs by the school or government. But most of them should find their jobs themselves. So in China, many people , such as the graduates have to try their best to find jobs.	In China finding a job is as difficult as in Britain. Especially the graduates who just leave the schools and universities find that it is more difficult, because many companies and enterprises want some employees who have special skill [np6, 2-] or have experience. In society there are many choice [np6, 1-] for people to get their jobs. But you must make yourself good enough. And if you get some citification [fm1, 1-] of your education. you find more [aj3, 1-1] easier to find a good job.	That's the situation in our country. I hope your brother can find a good job soon.

I can understand your feeling very well, because in China the students leaving schools have to face the same problems as your brother.	In the past few years, people have less trouble in finding job [np6, 1-] because the school is responsible to allocate jobs. But things changed now.	Firstly, the work opportunities become more and more, and you have more chance [np6, 1-] the choose a job you like. When the graduation reason [wd7, 1-] comes, advertisements are around the campus. Even in the street, the job Ads [fm3, 1-], post [sn9, s-], cards are spread everywhere. To find a job is easy, but to find a good job is more difficult. Secondly, in order to get a satisfactory job, first of all, you should have more competent ability to compete with others, which can be achieved in two ways. One is [vp5,-] study hard, the other is [vp5,-] work hard. Of course the mark is important, but the practice [wd5, 1-] experience is also necessary. So nowadays students try their best to find a part-time job to enrich their working experience. Lastly, if the students can find a job by themselves, the schools can still recommend so [wd5, 1-] job [np6, 1-] to them, these are their last choice. If the student find themselves unfit the jobs they are offered, when the contract is expired, they can find another job.	Generally speaking, students who are still studying should be preparing to enforce their ability in order to find a good job in the future. I hope you brother can also find a good job. I'm looking forward to recieving [fm1,-] your good news.																Yours Catherine

Now I would like to introduce [wd3, 1-] the situation in China to you.	In the past, school and college leavers were all allocated jobs by the government. But things change [vp6,s-] nowadays. There are several other means. The first important one is to go to the job market and have a [np6, 1-2] continuous interviews. The second possibility is to look into some advertisement [np3, 1-] in the newspaper, billboard. And if you are interested, you can write to contact. Another possibility is the so-called "back door". If your parents or relatives are in high position [np6, 1-], they can certainly offer you a good job in their working office. The last but not the least is that you can be recommended by the school if you are an exellent [fm1,-] students [np6,3-].	Young people have problems finding job [np6, 1-] in China as well for many reasons. I just want to mention the most important one, that is, they suffer from a great competition pressure. Due to the population burden, there are many graduators [fm2, 1-] every year. But the chance of employment is limited. Only students who are good at many aspects can be more likely to find jobs they are satisfied. [sn7,s]	However, since the reform and open policy. [sn2,s]China is enjoying an economic boom. Moreover, since Hongkong has reverted to the motherland, we can foresee a bright future. I believe people will find it easier to have a job in the next decade. If your brother is interested in working in China, maybe he can come to have a try. Wish best regards.														Yours truly. Erica

I'm very happy to receive your letter. You asked me about the job opportunities and situation in China. I hope I can be of some help to you.	In the past, Chinese school leavers were all automatically allocated jobs by the goverment [fm1,-]. But it's not the case nowadays. Automatically allocating jobs has caused a lot of problems. On the one hand, students are allocated to the position they are not suitable to. Their ability can't be fully reflected [wd3, 1-]. On the other hand, companies can't get the people they really need. So, since 1980s, the government changed the way. Students can have two ways to find their job. The government and schools will recommend some suitable students to the companies. At the same time, students can go out to look for job themselves. The students can have their own choice on what kind of job they want to do.	In this way, both companies and students are satisfied. But you know, with the development of the economic situation and education level, there are more competitions in the society. Some university students can't find jobs and have to stay at home. Therefore, it is still true in China [wd4, s]you can earn a living if you are qualified. Job applicants are encouraged to improve both knowledge and practical ability.	In general, the unemployment for young people is not so serious in China. If you have more questions, you can write to me. I'd be glad to help you.																Yours, Card, Shan

The graduates now must find jobs by themselves. After the Reform [fm3, 1-1]and Open Policy [fm3, 1-], the society needs more and more comprehensive [wd7, 1-] students.

Only several years before, almost all the school and college leavers are [vp6,s-] automatically allocated jobs by the government. Nowadays, with the awake [wd7, 1-]of the development of the "market economy" in our state, most of the graduats [fm1,-] have more choices to find jobs.

Some special professions such as those study in teachers' training school or agriculture and planting school, police training school etc [sn9, s] will still [vp9, -1] allocated jobs by government according [pp2, 1-]what they study. Then, most of them also have to find jobs by themselves. They can go to the job market or go to knock door by door to "sell" themselves.	In general, al long as you have real knowledge, real expertise, you will find a job after you graduat [fm1,-] from school. It also reflected [vp6,s-]that the competition is very severe and exciting too. Thus, everyone have [vp3, 1-] to work hard at their job [np6, s-] and try to do best, and continue studying, even when they are working.

I don't have any experience about job-seeking [sn9, s]so I have to answer your question according to what I read in magazine or what I learned from my friends.	In 1980s, nearly all the graduates were all automatically allocated jobs by the goverment [fm1,-], no matter whether they liked or not. The choice for them were [vp3, 1-] very rare. As a result, more and more youngsters complained about their jobs and this policy. To solve this big problem, in 1990s, many job markets appear [vp6,s-] in our countries [np6, 1-] . Graduates can take their chance in these job markets. Some top students can be recommended by their school directly to some big companies or govenmental [fm1,-] branches. While I have to say nowadays Chinese young people are facing increasingly serious problem [np6, s-] on job-seeking because of big population and less [np8, 1-] post [np6, s-]. A large number of skilled or middle-aged workers lost their jobs for economic depression or self disadvantages. They become the contesters [fm2, 1-] of young people. Our society can not offer more post [np6, s-] to both workers and young people. Although I am still two years away from graduation, I begin to worry about my future.	Ok! If you have any questions please write to me and I'm pleased to answer them. Please remember me to your brother and wish him good luck.

July 8th, 97Dear Mary,	I am very sorry to hear that your brother has some difficulties to find a job. However, the situation is even worse in China. A lot of school and college leavers can not find a job nowadays.	Government does no longer allocate jobs for the graduates, [sn8,s]because such automatically [wd2, 1-] assignment causes a lot of problems. For example, most of the graduates may not be appointed a job that is matched by his speciality [fm1,-]. As a result, the government encourages the school leavers to go directly to the company and have a face-to-face talk with the manger. Then both sides can find their satisfied [wd3, 1-] option.	As for the situation to find a job in China, there are a lot of difficulties. First of all, there are not enough jobs for the large population of graduates. This means few jobs and too many people. Moreover, the enterprises, especially the state-own enterprises are continuous to lose [wd3, -1] profit. [sn8,s] So, it can't not [ad1, 1-1] only recruit workers, but also [sn6, s] lay off a lot of works [wd3, 1-]. So, finding a job is a big problem that Chinese face today.

July 9th, 97Dear Betty,	I'm glad to receive your letter.	Since you're interested in employment situation in China, I'm going to tell you something abut [fm1,-] it.	In the past, the graduates from universities and colleges were usually allocated jobs by government. Actually, most of the graduates were quite satisfied with their future jobs. However, there were still some of them not satisfied who would rather not go to the units but look for another [wd3, 1-] ones.	Now, things has [vp3, 1-] changed. In accordance with the market access system, graduates have to hunt jobs themselves. Thus, competition arises [sn9, s] people are supposed to show their ability to be employed. This is sure to do good to our country's economic development. [sn8,s]	Generally speaking, young people do not have many problems finding work [wd3, 1-] in China. China is carrying out the open policy, which cause [vp3, s-] a lot of joint-venture companies appear. Both domestic companies and joint-venture companies need more labours [np5, 1-] and capable people. These factors [wd3,ss-] provide graduates with more job opportunity [np6, s-].	Still, some young men find it hard to get a job, because they have a lot of demands towards jobs. They want to find a high-salaryed [fm2, 1-] and good-welfared [fm2, 1-] job, which of course is a bit difficult for them to achieve success. [sn8,s]This kind of job is very popular and everyone wants to get it.	Well, do you have some idea now? I'm ready to answer your question if you are still not very clear about it.	With my best wishes.																Yours, Jocelyn

Class 4, Grade 95 English Department Guangdong University of Foreign Studies Guangzhou, China July 9th, 97Dear Lisa, 	I'm glad to hear from you. In your letter, you talked about the situation of finding jobs in Britain. Now, I'd like to recount the situation in China.	Years ago, Chinese school and college leavers are [vp6,s-] mostly automatically allocated jobs by the government. Things have moved quickly in recent years. The situation is not the same as before. It tends to become more and more difficult to find a good job for the school and college leavers. Why is it so? Every year, a large number of students graduated [vp6,s-] from schools and found jobs, but the retirement rate can not reach the fast increasing employment rate. [sn8,s]Most companies or authorities are fully flocked with people. The competition of finding a job hits every graduates [np3, 1-].	Nowadays, it's more popular for graduates to find a job themselves through all kinds of channels rather than wait to be assigned a job by governments. In order to get a satisfactory job, they have to train themselves. In their mind [np6, 1-], they define a new successful [wd7, 1-] formula, that is, self-quality pluses [wd2, 1-3] chances and pluses relationship. According to the formula, they pay attention to not only their knowledge training, but also catching every golden chance and establishing a good relationship in their commune. In doing so, they would have better chance of finding a good job.	All in all, in the present situation, it's not easy for young people finding work [wd3, 1-]. In order to find a job, you have to "sell" yourselves--- show your ability. That's the advice I get from the people who find good jobs. I hope you may have some idea of the job situation in China.	May your brother find a job!															Yours Vicky

July, 9, 1997Dear Leona,	I've received your letter of May 24th. It is really not an easy thing to find a job nowadays. Now I'd like to give you some ideas of job-hunting in China.	First of all, I should answer you that it is not an automatical [fm1,-] thing for the college leavers to be allocated jobs by the government. In the past it's [vp6,s-] really the case that once the students entered the univerity [fm1,-], they were sured [wd2, 1-] to receive a good job after their graduation. But nowadays, under the market economics [wd3, 1-], the principle for graduates to find jobs is that they have "face-to-face" talks with employers and both sides have right to choose their satisfactorying [fm2, 1-] partners.	It is the same case as in Britain that young people have problems in finding works [wd3, 1-] in China. On the one hand, current allocation system is based on students' comprehensive ability. Only those who are good at studying and social communications can satisfy the employers and get a good job. On the other hand, people's education level has increase a lot, being a college students [np3, 1-] is not longer an advantage.	In one word, it is not as easily [wd2, 1-] as before to find a job in China. It needs us to study harder and harder. [sn8,s] Anyway, wish you all good luck !															Yours Yvetle

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ???T													English Department Guangdong University of Foreign Studies Guangzhou, China January 4, 1996Dear Jack.	I'm glad to have received your letter. Now I'd like to introduce [wd3, 1-] the situation of finding jobs in our country to you.	The situation in our country has undergone a great change. Before informs [wd3, 1-], as you've mentioned, it's [vp6,s-4]the government that allocate school and college leavers. Gradually, there arouse [wd3, 1-] serious problems. For China is so big a country, the government can't arrange every school and college leaver's career properly. It's usual that students can't find a job and there're a lot of posts left empty in enterprises. So, the government put forward a series of reforms, who degenerate [wd3, 1-] the power of the [wd4, s] government to local governments and every school and college . On the one hand, governments and schools provide jobs for students. On the other hand, it also provides chances for enterprises and students themselves to choose each other. Thus, the demand and offer for jobs are basically balanced.	Even so, it become [vp3, 1-] more difficult nowadays for young people to find jobs because of the increasing numbers [np6, s-] of graduates. Every young people [np3, 1-] faces strong competition. Even college graduates will have difficulty in finding jobs. So I wonder if I will find a suitable job once I graduate.	Nevertheless, I hope your brother can find a god job soon.													 Yours sicnerely [fm1,-], Sun Yan

I'm sorry to hear that it is difficult for your brother to find a job after graduated [wd2, 1-] . I hope he will [sn8,s]be good luck. [sn8,s]	Compared with Britain, [sn4, s] the situation in China is not so serious. Most students can find a job after they graduated [vp6,s-]. In the past, it is [vp6,s-] the government who assign [vp6,s-] the job to the student when they [pr3, 1-] graduate. but now [fm1,-1] days, it is not the case any more. Most students should find job [np6, 1-] by themselves. They can find their job through many ways. Some student [np3, 1-] can find a job according [wd7, 1-1] to the advertisement. Some students go to the job market to sell themselves to the enterprise. There are [vp3,-s] a large amount [wd3, 1-] of people go to the company for a face-to-face interview. Now, China is implementing its reform and open policy. The economic [wd2, 1-] is developing very fast. The competition is [fm1,-] the job market is heavy. A good and high salary job often require [vp3, s-] the employee with good quality. So, most student [np3, 1-] are working hard to enrich themselves when they are at school. This system is beneficial to both enterprise and the students. Because through this system, the employees can choose the enteprise [fm1,-] and the company can also choose the employee at the same time.	I hope your brother will find a job soon. And I'm looking forward to hearing from you again.															Yours sincerely Stella

There are side effects despite China's progress in economy. Unemployment rate is rising and some college students can not find jobs. You mentioned in the letter that Chinese college leavers' allocation system. I think it's the case in the past. To some extend [wd2, 1-], this system is [vp6,s-] rigid. Nowadays Chinese college leavers have their right to choose jobs. At the same time, the companies also have right to choose people who they think are qualified. [sn8,s] All this is due to the state's reform on education system. The policy became more flexible and more effective. There are other ways for young applicants to get their jobs. They may go to the job-markets to present themselves. And of couse [fm1,-] when there is chance, surely there is competition. Some young people always have problems find work because they are unqualified. [sn8,s] That's the way things are.	On the whole, the situation of job-hunting in China, is getting better. Do I make myself clear, [[sn9,-] if [fm3,-]not, do write to me. I hope to hear from you soon.															Yours sincerely Yuan Tao

But the unemployment is also a big problem in China. What you heard about in Britain is only partially true in China. Usually after [sn3, s] graduating from schools or colleges, there are three ways to find a job in China. First, you may go direct to the job market or companies with you [pr4, 1-] resume to apply for a job. The higher the education you received [vp6,s-], the easier you can find a good job there. Second, government may allocate jobs for some graduates according to your [pr1, 1-] majors, but often these jobs are not very good. Last of all, you may find a job through some other ways, such as the introduction from your relatives or your friends. However, since there are too many people, especially young people in China, it will be very difficult for them to find a satisfactory job, and even a college student must face the chanllenge [fm1,-] from many others. 	So don't be so pessimistic. I hope your younger brother will find a job soon.	With my best wishes.															Yours, Zhou Hua

There are some young school and college leavers are unemployed, [sn8,s] but they only account for a small percentage of the population. Most young people have a job, for China is developing its economy and there are a lot of positions available in the job market.	Chinese school and college leavers used to be all automatically allocated jobs by the government, but it is not true now. Nowadays most school and college leavers find their jobs themselves, and of course, sometimes schools and colleges help their graduates to do so. As a result, these young people have choice about the jobs they do. But there are problems. Some young people's major subjects are popular and some not, so you may see in China some young people have several positions to choose while some cannot even get only one choice. Besides these young people, there are some school and college leavers who study certain subjects, such as geography, agriculture, automatically allocated jobs by the government. [sn8,s]	I look forward to hearing from you soon.															Yours, Zhukai

China also faces a problem of unemployment. But as China is developing fast, the situation is not as serious as you have mentioned. Though a large number of workers in textile factories have been layed [fm1,-] off, new factories and companies have been set up, which will provide enough posts for the people. Moreover, there are many join-venture companies in China, which need lots of workers and services. As a result, people don't have much problem in finding work, especially those well-educated. There is a variety of jobs for them to choose from.	As to the Chinese school and college leavers, they are no longer allocated jobs by the government. The companies would go to the college to ask for graduates themselves. As long as both the student and the company are contented, there will be a deal. So the students are employed through an interview with the company representatives. 	Best wishes.														 Yours Horatio

Considering job-hunting, is about the same situation in China, [sn8,s]compared with the one in Britain: factories are closing down, many people are out of the work, and it is difficult for newly-graduates [wd5, -1] men to find jobs.	Years ago, college leavers did not worry about their jobs, as you have talked about in your letter. The government would find jobs for them because China at that moment was lack [pp1, 1-1]in well educated people. Now, however, things have already changed. Because of the high unemployment, college leavers have to go around the city for quite a long time and find his [pr3, 1-] job with all his [pr3, 1-] efforts. Now government will help this time. Of course, some of them are able to find good jobs because of their good skills and knowledge as well as the help from relatives. But others are not. They have to search all the time. So tell your brother [sn9, s]don't worry about the job-hunting . Just be patient please.	I hope that he will be successful at last. 	Wish him good luck	and wish you good luck.

As for the situation in my country, the unemployment is not as severe as that in Britain [sn9, 1-] but recently the problem has got worse. Because of the reforms I have mentioned before, especially the restructuring of our state-own enterprices [fm1,-], more and more people are being laid off. However, the government is trying every means to create jobs for these people and so far has made some progress. Speaking of school and college leavers, they used to be all automatically allocated jobs by the government but along with the reform of our education system, most of them now have their own choices. Luckily, most college leavers don't have problems finding work. At least, I won't worry about finding myself in the street. The problem for most undergraduates now how to find a decent job in this prosperous economy.[sn8,s]	With regards.															Yours sincerely Stenphen

I can see that you are very curious about the situations for college leavers in China. I will give you a brief introduction below.	In the past, especially the early 80's , school and college leavers were mostly automatically allocated jobs by the government in China. The students didn't have other choices. When a person [vp7, -s] allocated a job, he or she must [vp6,s-] accept the job, whether willingly or unwillingly.	But nowadays things have changed a lot. Now we also have serious unemployment problems, especially to those who have just graduated from schools or colleges. The government no longer allocate [vp3, 1-] jobs for students. Most of the college leavers have to find jobs by themselves. Students can be recommended to the employers by the school authority, but the chances to get good jobs are rather small.	We also have many districts in which located a lot of the older heavy industry.[sn7,s] And the situation there is equally serious with that in Britain.	I sincerely hope that your younger brother will find a good job.	Hope to hear from you soon.															Yours, Qin

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, o?3/4																July 8thDear John, 	I'm sorry to hear about your brother's difficulty in finding a job. Situations nowadays in China is graduates becoming more and more difficult to find a job. [sn8,s]	After graduation, regular students are recommended to working posts. If they're not satisfied with the recommendation, they would have to find jobs for themselves. They might have choices, but this depends on their capability. Take it for example, a student might have chances to go to several job interviews. But whether she's employed or not depends on the boss because she might have many qualified competants [fm1,-]. Some universities will still remain jobless [wd7, 1-] because the need of personel [fm1,-] is not unlimited. For the students graduated not from universities [wd5, -1]colleges, chances of [wd3, -1]unemployed is much higher. Because of the wide use of machinery and computer, jobs needs [vp3, 1-] less [aj3, 1-] people but more professional knowledge. The good jobs are mostly taken by universities student [np6] and those without university qualification could hardly find a good job or even a job. Amongst ten of the non-university graduate [np6, 4-], six are jobless. On the whole, with the development of society, more and more youngsters have the opportunity to study in universities and competitions for jobs are more rigid. So more and more people will have problems in finding jobs.													   Yours He Jing

July 9th, 1997Dear Tom, 	From your letter, I know something about the employment situation in Britain. As far as I know, it's not so satisfactory in China, either. For example, many factories in my hometown have gone bankrupt and consequently, many people have lost their jobs. They are most adult women less accomplished [wd7, 1-] than those who remain at work.	As far as young people with high education are concerned, finding a good job is in fact, not very difficult, especially in some big cities such as Guangzhou. In two or three years, all graduates will have to find a job themselves, while at present, they are all automatically allocated with job [np6, 1-] by the government. But most of them find a job by themselves. Because in this way, they can find a much more satisfactory one, which coincides with their own intests[fm1,-]  and qualification, and with a better pay. With these choices, it's more flexible for them. [sn8,s]	So all in all, the employment situation in China is better than that in Britain. China is developing and her economy is improving. Opportunity is available to everyone who is highly qualified.																Yours, Helen

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ??																July, 9th , 1997Dear Mary,	I think college graduates in China more or less have to face the same problem as your brother in the last couple of years. but I think the situation in China is quite different with [pp1, 1-] that of Britain. China began to develop its economy at a relatively rapid pace only two decades ago, and it has more vigor than the old developed countries like Britain. However, owing to the depession [fm1,-] in the economic cycle and the large population in China, unemployment remains a problem in some periods. But in the years to come, as China's economy begins to recover, he [pr1, 1-] can expect a higher employment rate.	College leavers used to be automatically allocated jobs by the government. But some reforms took place in the past several years and now most college graduates find their own jobs in the job market. Of course this will result in more violent competition in getting a job. Sometimes the colleges will recommend a job for you, and there are still a fraction [wd3, 1-] of graduates on some special majors are assigned their jobs by the goverment [fm1,-]. [sn8,s]	Have I answer [vp9,s-] your questions clearly? Anyway, I hope your brother will find a job soon.																 Yours Jane

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ?ta	Talking about the problem of unemployment in China, I think it is generally less serious because of the prosperity of our economy. What young people are concerning here is not usually whether they can find a job or not, instead, whether the job will be good enough or not. You know, the rapid economic development has brought about competition, thus, more and more highly educated young people are needed in the job market. Therefore, if a schoolleaver has a degree in hand, he stands [vp1, 1-] much better chance for a good job. But for the less educated young people, finding a well-paid job with good prospect is much more difficult.	However, this doesn't mean any university graduate is guarrenteed [fm1,-] for [wd5, 1-] a good job. Since reform has [vp6,s-1] been carried out, most graduates have to look for jobs by themselves instead of waiting for the government [np4, 1-1] allocation. I think this is a good change really. In this way, we are going to have more choices and can make our own decision. We are also urged to work harder in the university so that one day we can be singled out in the competition for a good job.

July 9, 1997Dear Monica,	I was very glad to receive your letter, in which you asked me something about employment situation in China. Now I just tell you what I know about.	It is true that Chinese school and college leavers used to be automatically allocated jobs by the government. In those days student [np6, s-] didn't need to worry about that they couldn't find a job but they had no freedom to choose a job they wanted. Nowadays this policy has changed. After graduation students find jobs by themselves. Some of them go to job market and apply for any jobs they want to have. Some of them take jobs that are recommended by colleges. Some of them just find jobs through their parents or relatives. Under the changed policy, students have much more freedom to choose a job which they think is suitable to themselves. But there are some students who can not find a proper job immediately. They are also faced with the same situation as your younger brother is. But on the whole most student [np3, 1-] can gradually find a job as long as they don't always ask for high salaries.	That's what I know about China's situation on students' applying for jobs. I hope your brother will find a job soon and I am looking forward to hearing from you.                           Yours,                            Cen Runtao

As to the job-hunting situation in China at the [wd5, 1-] present, I'm afraid it's no longer what you have heard. It used to be true when the country was in great need of intellectuals. Nowadays, most school and college leavers look for jobs all by themselves. However, most colleges will provide opportunities for the students to meet with some companies.	Usually young people have problems finding work at first. But most of them do get a job. Two weeks ago some friends in Shenzhen University complaint [wd2, 1-] about how hard it was to get a job, but as far as I know, all of them have a job now, and they are quite satisfied with it [pr3, 1-]. After all, our country is undergoing a rapid developing period, which naturally provides a lot of opportunities. So long as you are educated, fast-learning and willing to work, you'll have a job and often a good one.	I wish your brother'll [fm2, 1-] get a job soon. Best regards.

Although we have unemployment, it only amounts to very little [np8, 1-] percentage.	What you've heard is a thing of the past already. Since such system often caused mismatching, the government has made some improvements. As a result, those school and college leavers are no more automatically allocated jobs. Some may get advice from the school, but whether to accept the job or not will be according to their own will. [sn8,s]Arrangements are made for companies and graduates to meet so that the choice can be made towards both directions. If the company is satisfied with the student's performance and the student is willing to enter that company, then he or she successfully gets the job. As for others, they go to the market themselves to look for jobs.	So, you see how we young people find jobs in China. Generally, the school and college leavers just meet the market's demand, and problems do not occur very often.

You might [vp9, 1-] worry about your brother. I hope he will soon get a job.	Compared [vp2, 1-1] to the situation in Britain, [sn4, s] China is not much better than it.[sn8,s] With the bankcrupcies [fm1,-] of factories and some enterprises, there are more and more people unemployed and there are less [aj3, 1-] job opportunies [fm1,-]. So school and college leavers, as well as other people, find it more difficult to get a job.	Though there are chances for them to be allocated by schools and universities, most of them have to find a job by themselves. Since the goverment [fm1,-] and schools are no longer responsible for the allocation of all graduates, they have to do so. Sometimes they have to compete with four or five or even more applicants for a single job. It can be seen that Chinese school and college leavers face some difficulties in abtaining [fm1,-] a job. And so do the other young people.	I hope I will get a job easily after graduation.	Best wishes.                         Yours,                          Zhang Junhua

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ???3/4y																July,9Dear Linda,	I'm sorry to hear that your brother has difficulty in finding a job. But the situation here in China is not good, either.	In the past, the college leavers were allocated jobs by the governments. So many students' jobs didn't suit them at all though everyone could get one. Things have changed a lot in recent years. Nowadays, students can find jobs by themselves. At the same time, of course, they are selected by employers. Colleges and governments will help in case students can't find one.	Because many big state-owned enterprise are in crisis at the moment, many people have been laid off. As the economic situation is not good, other companies like joint-ventures, don't want to add [wd3, 1-] people. So the competition for job is very stiff.

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ???																July 9th, 1997Dear Jack,	I was happy to receive your letter yesterday. As to the problems of finding work, I'd like to give you some idea about how things going on here in China.	In the past few years, the government did allocate jobs for school and college leavers and they didn't have to worry about their jobs after graduation. But this sort of system had many defects as the factories couldn't get suitable talents they wanted while the graduates didn't have any choice about the jobs they were interested in.	Things have changed recently. Nowadays graduates should find jobs themselves and the factories can choose these graduates as long as this is going on under the government's direction. Naturally, this has lead [fm1,-] to a problem that some people can't find a satisfactory job immediately after graduation because of the heated competition. The situation here, however, is not that serious as in Britain. Usually these young people can go to work with the help of the district office.	Hope these [pr3, 1-] information will be of some help to you. Also hope your brother can find a job soon. Look forward to hearing from you.																																  Yours Jill

Comparing [aj4, 1-] with that of Britain's, I think, the employment situation in China is much better, at least in my part of the country. In recent years, many new areas of industry are developing rapidly, such as electronics telecommunication, etc. Thus, Many new companies have opened, and there are more and more job opportunities. For example, The graduates this year in my university claim that it's much easier to find a job this year than last year. Nearly 90% of them had already located a job before the graduation ceremony.	However, considering the ever larger number of job-finders, proper managing is very important. In China, we used to have a system of job allocation. But nowadays, it is replaced by a system of mutual choice. In this system., The schools or the government act only as a media. they arrange meetings where the prospective employers and employees may have a chance to contact with each other. The employers are than [wd5, 1-] free to select the graduates, and the graduates also have the freedom to accept or reject the job. That's why call this system "mutual choice".[sn8,s]

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ????a														Class 1 Grade 95 English Department Guangdong University of Foreign Studies 7/8/97Dear John,	I was glad to receive your letter.	As to the situation in China, I think, on the whole it is not so difficult. Because of the rapid development in economy, more and more factories, enterprises as well as joint ventures have been established. These require a large number of people. So school leavers, especially college graduates find it not difficult to find a job. However, it is not easy to find a descent one. Some people have to take up a job which has nothing to do with his major. Some even complain that they should do as a labour after graduating in a college. [sn8,s] So generally you can find a job, but it may not satisfy you. Nowadays, we apply for the [wd5, 1-] job by ourselves.	The companies, factories and enterprises, are also free to choose by themselves. So this helps both sides to get their needed choice. 	I hope I have given you some useful information and I hope your brother will find a descent job soon.														  Yours Lin Yuan Yuan

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ?1/4?1/4?															July, 9th 1997Dear Alice,	I was very glad to get your letter of June 19th. With reference to your questions in the letter, I'd now like to tell you something about how the Chinese graduates get a job.	In the past, the school leavers were automatically allocated jobs by the government. They didn't have to spare much effort to find one. However, they had not right to choose a satisfactory job on their own. Nowadays things have changed a lot. Instead of being allocated jobs by the school and the government, the students are free to find a suitable job for themselves. Anyhow, it is not easy at all. Most of the job seekings [fm2, 1-] begin a year earlier before graduation. They write applications to the companies they are interested in and have interviews with them. If each side is satisfied [sn9, s] they sign a contract. The schools are no longer responsible for finding a job for each student, but they do make recommendations. 	This is how a Chinese student find a job nowaday [fm1,-]. If you have further questions, please write to me. Do hope your brother will get a good job soon.	With best wishes														Yours Sarah

Children play with them [pr1, 1-] around home for fun.	It is believed that the moon at [pp1, 1-] that night is [wd4,1-3] brightest and roundest, and people admire it. There is a beautiful legend too. It is about a [np7, 1-] ancient lady named changer, who ate the elixir and became a fair lady flied to the moon. Then she felt lonely and missed home much. So poets in ancient China usually wrote poems about her and the homesick.	Nowadays, more and more people send thire [fm1,-] greeting to overseas Chinese with moon cakes and let them feel people here also miss them much.	Up to now, the Mid-Autumn Festival is more a time for reunions than a celebration for harvest.

Chinese people also observes the festival as a romantic story that a beautiful fairy flies [sn8,s] after the moon.

In my town, people, especially old people, make all kinds of lanterns, they're beautiful and colourful. After dinner, we go out to admire the full moon and watch lanterns. We exchange moon cakes and visit relations and friends as well. To moon cake, here's a tale of it. It's said that in Tang Dynasty ( ancient China ), the King was saved in trouble of the Civil War.

At last he committed suicide by jumping into a river called Miluo Jiang on 5th, 5th in the lunar [fm1, -1] calledar.	Appreciating his loving motherland, people make the day of his death a festival and on that day, people make a lot of dumplings and throw them into the river in order to prevent the fish from eating Qu yuan. And of course, people themselves eat the dumplings, too. People also have races of running dragon boat in the river. At that time, a lot of people gather along the river to see the performance. The [wd6, 1-] race is very exciting. And it is also the reason that we call the festival " Dragon Boat Day".	But Nowadays [fm3,-], people celebrate the Dragon Boat Day more for exciting than for memorizing Qu yuan's death.

And we also burn incenses and plunge them into a kind of rounded [wd2, 1-] fruit. We are very happy at [pp1, 1-] that night. We sing, dance, play games and let off firecrackers.

I'd like to tell you, but this time, I would first tell you one of them- [wd4, s]Dragon Boat's [fm2, 1-] Day, which is celebrated on April 1st in lunar calendar.	Dragon Boat's [fm2, 1-] Day originates from the ancient China. It honores [fm1,-] a very famous person in China--Qu Yuan who loved his country very much and died for it. The first celebration of the festival was to drop the dumplings made of sticky rice. It means they were the food for Qu Yuan who dived into [wd4, s] Milou River and died. Later, [fm3, -1]Since people did this by boat and the form of commemoration changed. Now, there will be Boat Match on the day everywhere in our country. The Boat is so called "Dragon Boat".	There's a river ( the pearl river ) runs across Guangzhou. [sn8,s]We used to hold "Dragon Boat Match in the river every year by individual. In recent years, the match has been held by the government establishments of the city and the match is becoming international. The government will invite boat teams of many countries to take part. Maybe you have heard of this, however, the teams of our countries will just keep the Chinese traditional style. They wore the clothes of national style, that is a cloth surrounded the head. A white clothes without sleeves and a clothe belt circling the waist. They are boating as some of them playing Chinese style instruments. The scene is very interesting and stimulating.	I think I have told you the main details of the festival. I hope you'll come to see the celebration next year.

We celebrate this [fm3, -1] Festival on Autumn 15th in lunar calender [fm1,-]. This traditional festival comes from an old story. It's said that Change, a very beautiful fairy, came to live on the moon, together with a rabit [fm1,-]. She always appears on Autumn [fm3,-] 15th. So the Chinese people set [wd3, 1-1]aside Autumn 15th to remember her.	But nowadays, [wd4, s] Mid-Autumn Festival is more a day for people to gather together to have a meal than a day to remember the fairy. In my hometown, people who work out of the city always come back in [pp1, 1-] that day to meet their families. They gather together, having a large meal and eat the famous moon cakes. Some of them hold a fruit party, in which many kinds of fruit [np3, 3-] are shown to be eaten. There are some old people who believe that Change lives on the moon, so they prepare some food, including mooncakes, for the fairy, hoping she will bring good luck to them. In these ways, people spend a very happy day.

The Lantern Festival	The Lantern Festival, which is also known as Yuan Xiao Jie, is an important traditional Chinese festival. It is said that the ancient Chinese observed the festival to pray for good harvest in the coming year. Nowadays, it becomes a holiday for family reunion and people just enjoy themselves on the day. Most similar with people in other parts of China, people in Zhejiang province observe this festival in an exciting way.	Lion dances and lanterns are the most important symbols of the festival, when the dark of Jan. 15th of Chinese lunar calender [fm1,-] comes, every house lights their lanterns and highly [wd2, 1-] hangs them in the front of the door. Then people in groups go to see the lion dances, which played by the young man. The lions are made of colourful silks and they're supposed to catch a big red ball lifted by a tall young man.	People also eat Tang yuan on this festival. Tang yuan is a kind of dumpling made of gloutinous [fm1,-]rice with sweet fillings. As you can guess, Tang yuan sombolizes [fm1,-] good luck for the whole family. Another program of the festival is gussing [fm1,-] rieddors [fm1,-] sticking on the lanterns.

In the past, it's the government's responsibility to allocat [fm1,-] the college leavers jobs, the leavers should absolutely obeyed the allocation. But, in recent years, things have changed greatly. School and college leavers can look for jobs by themselves, that is to say, they can have their own choices about the jobs they do.

And I'm also surprised by [sn8,s] such situation in Britain. As far as I know, the situation in China is not so serious as that in Britain. Though it is more difficult for young persons to get a good job recently, it is not difficult to get a job if you don't mind what kind of job it is. Because the reform and opening policy of our country give us more chances to work. It is the case [wd7, 1-] that Chinese college leavers are [vp6,s-]all automatically allocated  jobs several years ago, but it is not true in recent years. Several years ago, our government pays [vp6,s-] for the education of college students. So the government has [vp6,s-] the right to send them to the place where they are [vp6,s-] needed. As for my case, I pay for my education, so I have the freedom to choose my job. This new educational policy make [vp3, 1-] college students have more choices about the jobs they do, but it also challenges them. The young people have to look for a job by themselves. Some young people have problems finding work because of competition. I look forward to [pp1, 1-1]hear from you if you have any questions. Yours sincerely, Aceberg.

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, D ?												Class 5																    English Department Guangdong University of Foreign Studies Guangzhou, China Dear Lily,	Learning your brother's present situation, I'd like to give you some idea of Chinese school leavers' situation in nowadays.	In the past, all the school and college leavers in China were automatically allocated jobs by the goverment [fm1,-]. But it is not exactly the case now. Most of us, except those who major in education, are supposed to find jobs by ourselves. The schools are only responsible for recommending you to some work units and it is up to the work units to decide whether we are employed or not. We ourselves [sn9, s]unlike in those days when students were bound to follow the schools' distribution order [wd5, 1-] to the appoited [sn9, s] work unit, are also free to choose the job as we like. A work relation can be established only when both sides, the employer and the employee [sn9, s] are satisfied with each other. The compitition [fm1,-] is very sharp in China. It is also not easy to find a job in the job market. However, as college students, we are assured that if we study hard and really grasp the useful skills , finding a job is no problem.Don't be so worried about your brother's job. Let's hope for the best.                           Yours faithful,                               Leslie

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ????Dear Joan,	Comparing with Britain, [sn4, s] the situation in China is much better. China develop [vp3, 1-] quite fast now and its economy growth rate is above 6% in recent years. So a large number of people can hold their job down. Although some state-run enterprises go into liquidation and subsequently a few workers were laid off, that doesn't affect young people very much. Because they are young, they are quick at learning their skills, which is to the delight of many companies.	Nowadays school and college leavers in China are no longer automatically allocated jobs by the government although it was true a few years ago. People can have many choices about the job they do. They can either contact the factories, companies and enterprises throught [fm1,-] the school management or go directly to the job market to apply for a job.	Usually young people don't have problem in finding a job when they leaves [vp3, 1-] school or college as long as they get the certification. Chances will be more if their marks are high and [sn8,s] their capability in dealing with practical problems.															Yours truthly [fm1,-],                             Lun Lichan

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ?3/4yDear Lisa:	I was glad to hear form you and sorry for your brother's situation. I hope things will change better [sn8,s] in near future.	In 60's and 70's, China adopted the policy of automatically allocation for school and college leavers, but it's not so nowadays. School and college leavers have to find a job [np3, s-] themselves. Usually, they will begin this project [wd7, 1-] in the last year of college. There are several ways, such as personal relations, school' recommendation, to get a job. There are also some need-and-supple [fm1,-] meetings for graduates, which are sponsored by school, in order to pave the way for them to get jobs.	Thanks to China's rapid economic development, lots of knowledgeable people are needed in the job market. Thus it's not so difficult to find a job especially in GuangDong, where all kinds of joint-ventures, companies and firms exist. If a person is willing to work hard, it will be quite ease to get a job. However, nowadays many graduates expect to own comfortable and high-paid job [np6, 1-]. For such people, there is undoubtable [fm2, 1-] to be some struggle ahead. As to the choice of jobs, it falls in to 2 catalogues [wd3, 1-]. For the so-called "heated-field" majors, such as trade, interpretation, computer, etc, there is a great range of jobs for them; while for the "cold-field" majors, such as biology, chemistry, the manpower is either in short supply or can't find a good job, which is rather strange. So much is what I know about China's situation. I hope my answer could satisfy you. Best wishes!                          Yours sincerely                            ?3/4y

July, 9, 1997 Dear Mary,	I am very sorry to know that your brother have difficulty to [sn8,s]find a job. But don't worry about [sn8,s] too much. Things will be all right soon.	As far as I know, young people in China also have problems finding work. It is not true that the school and college leavers are all automatically allocated jobs by the government. That was an old practice. Nowadays, most of the college leavers also have to find the jobs by themselves and the college will help [wd5, 1-1]to give some suggestions. All these changes are due to the paying tuition system. So the college leaver has his own choice about the job. But in some normal school [np3, 1-3] and agricultural school, they still have to accept the job assigned by the government. Since the development of the society, it needs more high skill [sn8,s]personnel and management. So people do not have high education have great trouble to find the job, especially in the well-developed place [np6, s-]. On the other hand, even if you have received high education, the company will take the experiences into great consideration. The college leavers without pratical [fm1,-] skill or experiences will also be rejected by the job market. Another markable [fm2, 1-] problem is that the college leavers gather to the well-develop [wd4, s] to find jobs and are unwilling to go to some poorer places. That makes unbalance for the job market. I think, on the whole, the situation of employment for young people in China is not much better that than [wd1, s]of Britain. 	I hope your brother can find a good job soon and both of you can enjoy the Christmas. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.																	Yours,                               Helen

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ???t															July, 9, 1997Dear Mary,	Glad to hear from you. I would like to answer the questions concerning jobs in your letter first.	Generally speaking, compared to Britain, the employment situation in China is much better. According to recent data in China Daily, the unemployment rate among young people is only about 3% in China. Most of the young people have many job opportunities available. 	Well, in the past, all college graduates were allocated jobs automatically by the government in China. However, things have changed a lot now. When college students graduate, usually their colleges will offer some job opportunities to them and recommend some excellent graduates to a certain profitable companies as well. But the choice lies in the graduates themselves. They have free will to choose whatever companies to enter. Besides the offering by their colleges, the graduates can also go to the job markets on talent services in the society. There are lots and [wd5, 1-1]lots of such services in many cities in China, especially along coastal cities. All graduates have various choices there. 	Of course, for some people it seems the future is not as promising as before. Therefore, most young people regard it more challenging and interesting to find jobs themselves through competition. 	Well, above is some of my understanding of the employment situation in China. Hope it has answered your questions. 	With best wishes.

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, 1/2"?"a																July, 9,1997Dear Ann,	Generally speaking, to find a job after graduation in China seems comparatively easy than in Britain owning [fm1,-] to the distribution system. Based on this distribution system, it is true that Chinese school and college leavers are all automatically allocated jobs by the government. Although this system can solve the problem of serious unemployments [np5, 1-] , it brings about other problems at the same time. As you mentioned in your letter, under this uninflexisible [fm2, 1-] system, people have less [np8, 1-] choice about the jobs they do. Sometimes it is the reason for inefficiency on some positions because of people's lack of interest in their distributed jobs. In other words, people lose the spirit which can encourge [fm1,-] them to make great achievements on their [np6, -1] position.	In order to overcome the weakness of this system and solve the problem of low efficiency, some reforms are carrying out. For instance, nowadays most of the graduates can have more opportunities on the job market according to the "Double-Choice Principle". That is to say, graduates not only can find their favourite jobs freely on the job market by their own, but also can consider to accept the job which their school or government offer [vp3, 1-]. In this way, both needs are met.	As a result, the problems leave [sn8,s] to ourselves. As long as we qualify ourselves [sn8,s] compatitive [fm1,-] enough at university, we have less [np8, 1-] difficulties in finding a satisfatory [fm1,-] job.

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ??o?	I feel so sorry for the situation in Britain. I think the employment here is much more [wd5, 1-] better.	Two years ago, all the Chinese college leavers are autonatically [fm1,-] allocated jobs by the government. But the situation has changed now. The government no longer pays for our tuition fees, and we can choose where we would be like to go to. 	As we all know, China is developing rapidly. The economic situation is in a very good shape. Thousands of factories and companies are formed every day. The well trained people are needed and the unemployment rate decreases. Being an English undergraduate, I almost have no problem in finding a job, because there are more and more foreigners starting investment in China and my language skill helps me a lot. I think It [fm3, 1-] is the same case to other young people. They have a lot of opportunities to improve themselves and they can get jobs if they want to. However, as the result of the competition, some workers of the poor-managed enterprises loss [wd2, 1-] their jobs. The government attach [vp3, 1-] importance to them. Most of them are retrained so that they can be comprehensive [wd7, 1-] to another work. I have once read from a newspaper that a middle-age [fm1,-] woman worker began to run her own bussiness [fm1,-] after lossing the job and now she even earn [vp3, 1-] more money than before. Finally, I hope that your brother can find a job soon.

As for your questions, [sn9, s] about things in China, I'd say I am no expert on this issue. Nevertheness [fm1,-], I'll try my best. Several years ago, Chinese school and college leavers did have the privilege to be allocated jobs automatically. But things have changed, since the implementation of the open door policy. More and more competitions [sn8,s]occur on the market. People are free from the previous assignment scheme and they have the right to choose their careers out of their own accord. This, obviously, stimulates people and breathes new vigor to the society. However, despite its [fm1, -] overwhemingly [wd2, 1-] advantage, it also cause [vp3, 1-] problems. People find it more and more difficult to find a job, and job-hunting has become headaches of job-lossers [fm2, 1-]. Unemployment rate rises, especially in slack seasons. Hopefully, our government has taken various measures to guide the job market and managed to strike a ballance [fm1,-] of the society.	Well, in 2 years, I will be facing the job-hunting., I somwhat [fm1,-] worry about it. When will you graduat [fm1,-] from the college? If you have any further questions, feel free to write to me, ok?

Although as the open policy the reforming policy [vp7, s] are carrying out, which [vp3, -1] have created many more jobs in many cities, the situation has [sn8,s] little improvement, because many farmers move into the cities to find job [np6, 1-], and their payments are much lower. However, there are more chance [np6, 1-] to find a good job in Guangzhou, because it is a coastal city, and it is the neighbor of HongKong and Macau [fm1,-].	Nowadays, many Chinese school and college leavers are not automatically allocated jobs by the government, but by themselves. Thus, they have free choice about the jobs they do as long as the [fm1,-] can find them. Consquently [fm1,-], there are many competitions and chanllenges [fm1,-] between young people. It requirs [fm1,-] them more academic trainings [np5, 1-] and abilities. Nevertheless, if you are capable, you don't have to worry about you future. Of course, if you are not, you will have problems finding work..	In our university this year, the graduates have [vp6,s-] all found their job [np3, 1-] before July, when they left school. Although some of them are satisfied with their jobs while some [wd3, 1-] are not, the overall situation is quite good. I believe that with the economic developing, we will eventually solve the unemployment problem in the future.

English Department Guangdong Foreign Studies University, PRC. 9, July, 97Dear Lucy,	I'm very glad to receive your letter. And I'll try my best to tell you what I know about China's situation of finding a job.	You mentioned that Chinese school leavers may all automatically be given a job by the government. In fact, because of the educational reforms, things have already changed. Students have to pay their tuation [fm1,-] fees [wd5, 1-] themselves. And our government are [vp3, 1-] no longer responsible for allocating jobs for students. As a result, students have to find jobs themselves after graduation. These reforms have brought about great changes in students' lives. They do not need to worry [vp1,1-] whether they will be allocated for [wd5, 1-] a [np7, 1-] unsatisfatory [fm1,-] job [wd4, s]not. On the other hand, they have to face the job market and be chosen by it. So they have to work hard and try their best to learn more skills. Otherwise, they will not be able to find a job.	The reforms have also changed the society. The companies and enterprises feel more [aj3, 1-1]free to choose their employees. More and more "job market" advertisements can be seen on newspapers. However, it's not easy to find a job at all, especially for the graduates. Experience, as you said, becomes very important. Of course, for those talented students who have comprehensive capability, there is always a position waiting for [pr1, -1] him.	At present, many young people came to realize that finding a job is not easy at all. The one who has already adjust [vp6,-] himself to the market may find it easier. Though unemployment rate is not that high in China, nearly every graduates [np3, 1-] can feel the great pressure of finding a job.	As far as I myself are concerned, I think I welcome this change. It makes China more active. And I'll try my best to make myself a good applicant.	I hope this information may be helpful . I'm looking forward to hearing from you again.

I'm sorry for your younger brother's condition.	I'd like to tell you the situation about jobs in China in reply to the questions in your letter. It is true that there is a period when Chinese government allocate jobs to school and college leavers. However, this period will end from [pp1, 1-] the year when I graduate from university. In other words, the old job allocated system will be abandoned in 2 years. The new system can only recommend students to the enterprises, but whether go or not [sn8,s] is up to the graduates themselves. Unlike the leavers under the old system, the graduates under the new one can choose the jobs on their will without paying any fee to the college. On the other hand, this new system causes a competition between graduates. Nowadays, Chinese economic development is facing a challenge [sn8,s]whether it can keep going in a steady fast speed. And it's also the challenge for the graduates. If you want to win the competition and get your ideal position, you must have excellent skills. In general, there is also a difficult condition in Chinese job market.	I hope your brother will find his favourate [fm1,-] job soon. And I'm looking forward to your good news. Yours sincerely, Amanda.

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ?aD??(c)																July,9,1997Dear Jack, 	Glad to receive your letter and learn that your younger brother has just graduated and began [fm1,-] to look for a job. But I'm afraid the situation of getting a job in your country is not so good as that in China.	In the past few decades, Chinese school and college leavers were all automatically allocated jobs by the government. Because at that time, there was [vp3, 1-] not so much highly educated people and eventually they had become precious. Nowadays, more and more people can go to schools and colleges, it seems impossible for China to appoint jobs to those leavers. As you can see, with the open-door policy being carried out, China has developed a lot and the job market is now much more competitive than before. So the Chinese school and college leavers have more chances to find jobs for themselves. They can go where they can find a good job and most of them can find one. However, there are still some problems for them to get a job, such as lacking experience, [sn6, s] impractical ideas that make them lose good jobs and so forth.	On the whole, the situation for school and college leavers to get a job is quite pleasing in China although there are still some problems. I'm sure with the development of economy, the situation will be better both in your country and China.															Yours Sincerely																Wu Xiuwen

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ?Y??Dear Jack, 	In your last letter, you asked me what the situation is for young people to find a job in China. Actually, the situation isn't very good for us nowadays, either.	In the past, every college leavers [np3, 2-] were [vp3, 1-] all automatically allocated jobs by the goverment [fm1,-]. But now, when we enter the college, we are informed that the goverment [fm1,-] and school won't be responsible for finding a job for us. We have to find jobs by ourselves and the job market isn't so good as before. I know that some graduates in our college this year can't find jobs. They have to wait, just like your brother. But I think they can soon find a job if they are willing to enter some small companys [fm2,-].	In the past few years, China's economy developed rapidly. And now, it seems to cool off. Many companys [fm2,-2] and factorys [fm2,-] set up in the 1980s, are closing down now. So less [np8, 1-] people are required in the market and most of us have to find other ways. But I think it will be better in the next few years. After a time to [sn8,s]cool off, I believe the economy in China will develop smoothly again.															Yours sincerely,																	Helena. 

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, 3??1/2??	In your last letter, you asked about the situation of job finding in China. I should say things were not so [sn8,s] as you imagined. Nowadays, Chinese school and college leavers mostly choose work [wd3, 1-] themselves. Usually, before their graduation, companies, enterprises who [pr5,-] are either state-run or private arrive at schools to find if there are graduates they need. At the same time, it is also the time for students to decide which unit they prefer to work for. By this means, by the end of the last semestor [fm1,-] on campus, most of students will have obtained a satisfatory [fm1,-]post. However, as for those who do not secure [wd7, 1-1]work, the local government of their birthplace is to arrange a job for them. Commonly, the graduates are unable to make any choice of it.	So far, searching for [wd5, 1-] a job in China is not as terrifing [wd7, 1-] as in Britain, though a certain number of problems do occur recently. Along with the development of China's economy, more and more competent and high qualified employees are needed. School leavers are supposed to face more competition and challenges. Particularly, those servcing [wd7, 1-] for private companies will be laid off, if their work [sn8,s]is ineffecient. On [pp1, 1-1] the pressure of competition, people currently are forced to enhance their skills of work. I hope I have conveyed [sn8,s] you what you want to know and it has helped somehow.

July 9, 1997Dear Beth,	I'm [vp6,s-]very glad to receive your letter two days ago and I'm writing to inform you [vp1, 2-] situation in China.	I have a friend who is going to graduate from university this year. Yesterday she went to downtown for a job interview. She failed to get the job because of lack of experience. Nowadays, things in China have changed a lot. Although there're still some positions provided by the state for school leavers, most of them can not meet the need and satisfaction [wd7, 1-3] of the applicants. People in China tend to look for jobs themselves. However, things are not as easy as what they expected. Since the opening policy [sn8,s]being brought into effect in China, the fundamental construction of job market has changed. The new development of economy requires more modern technical and productive skills. In addition, more efficient, high-level, experienced personnels [wd3, 1-] are also required.	On the whole, as the development of modern society, the standard of qualities of job hunters becomes much higher than before. As a result, it become [vp3, 1-] more difficult for college leavers to find a good job after graduate [wd2, 1-]. On the other hand, lack of experience is also another problem they have when they're looking for a job.	I hope this letter will give you a rough graph of situation in China. If you have any question, write to me as you like. I'll try to give you a satisfactory answer.															Yours sincerely,																Catherine

I hope he can find a satisfactory one soon.	From your introduction, the unemployment rate among the youth in Britain is really very high. Comparatively speaking, China's situation is not so serious. But still, job hunting is China is becoming more and more difficult.	Years ago there seemed to be no problem for a young man to find a job. Everybody who graduated from colleges or techinical [fm1,-] schools was automatically allocated jobs by the government. This full-employment actually caused many problems. For example, the graduated students may be reluctantant [fm1,-] to apply for the job he was allocated to, and the company's side [sn8,s] may also get the unnecessary labour.	After China began to reform, things changed a lot. The Government was no longer responsible for the school leavers [np4, 1-] employment. The individuals have the freedom to choose their bosses and the companies can find the suitable persons by themselves. Many job markets came into being. It is now quite common for the school leavers, or even university graduates to hunt for jobs for a long time. Some of them are not necessarily having difficulty in finding jobs; they are just waiting for better ones. But after all, this way of job hunting is much more competitive than the formar [fm1,-]one, so it is much more difficult for us to find a job, especially in some hot fields, like in the bank and foreign trade companies, the compition [fm1,-] is very serious.	I wish I have given you a brief idea of the China's empolyment [fm1,-] situation. Best wishes to you and your family.															Yours ever																	Ann

In China, nowadays, the condision [fm1,-] is something like [sn4,s] Britain. Jobs are not enough for young people. There is a common feeling in students' mind. That is [sn9, s] graduation means losing their jobs. Because after graduation, many young people can [wd7, 1-] find jobs and have to stay at home. [sn2,s] In the past, it was true that school and college leavers were all automatically allocated jobs by the government. And students had no [wd6, -1] little choice, because their [np5, -1] tuitions were paid by the government. [sn2,s] It led to many problems. For example, some didn't like their jobs, and some had to leave their hometown to work outside. Since the reformation of education, things have changed greatly. Nowadays, the government is paying less and less tuition for students and they can choose their jobs. So after the graduation, many young people will have to visit companies, factories or job agencies. But some important majors, such as teacher, police, and so on are still supported by the government because our countries [np6, 1-] needs more qualified teachers and police. But as more and more college students graduate, jobs become less [aj3, 1-2] and less correspondingly. As you know [sn9, s] it is because of our large population. It is a great effect [sn8,s] to our country.	Please let me know what kind of job your brother find [vp3, 1-] at last. I am sure he can find a job that fixs [fm2,-] himself.

You need not worry too much about him.	As regard to your questions, I think I can just give you some general ideas as our country's policies and ensuing situation is [vp3, 1-] changing. Firstly, as far as I can observe, our situation is less serious than that of Britain. Those who have got certificates of senior high school or of college are not difficult to find jobs if their requirement of payment is not too [wd5, -1] much high. Secondary [sn6, s], I should let you know that the policy the Chinese school and college leavers are all automatically allocated jobs by the goverment [fm1,-] has been over. Everybody has to go into the job market. People can choose their jobs at their own will. As China is a developing country, there are certainly many posts in many fields. People can choose freely according to their qualities.	Please forgive me if there are any false information [sn9, s]as I am not an expert. 																	Yours,																		Adam

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, D?3/4??Dear Don,	I am very sorry to hear that your son is unemployed.	In general, the situation of unemployment is not so serious in China for the time being. The developement [fm1,-] of new areas of science and technology provides a coniderable [fm1,-] number of labors [wd3, 1-]. But the problem becomes serious in some aspects in society when an increasing number of nation-owned factories close down, which leaves many workers laid off. While college graduates are automatically allocated or easily find a job by [fm1, -1] themself, access to a new job. [sn8,s]This is a very serious problem in China.	It is true that Chinese college graduates are assigned by the government. But as a result of rapid growth in population and less corresponding developement [fm1,-] in economy, the number of assignment is decreasing every years [np3, 1-] and an increasing number of graduates find no jobs. So people don't expect to get jobs on their will. Unemployement [fm1,-] is becoming serious now. People have to refresh [wd3, 1-] to a new job to meet the requirement of the society. We expect to see the resolution of this issue. 	Best wishes to you!															Yours sincerely,																Alex Xu

I hope that things will [sn8,s]looking up after some time. Compared to Britain, actually [ad1, 1-] China also has unemployment problem. It is true that a few years ago school and college leavers were all automatically allocated jobs by the government. Nowadays, however, it is not the case.	People have choice about the jobs they do, but it is controlled in some extent. Students have to look for jobs in the job market after graduation, and of course they have flexibility in choosing their careers. Usually the students who have the ability of speaking foreign language and operating computer are more [aj3, 1-1] easy to get a job, especially those who have working [wd3, 1-] experience. Meanwhile, some young people without a [np7, 1-] acedemic [fm1,-] certificate or professional skills find that to get a job in this competitive modern society is a real headache of them.	Remember me to your younger brother and wish you lucky.														 Yours sincerely,																Howard

English Department, Guangdong University of Foreign Studies, Guangzhou China													July 9th, 1997Dear Jack, 	I am so glad to receive your letter and very interested on the topic about employment situations between China and Britain.	As [cj2, 1-] I know, Chinese school and college leavers are not automatically allocated jobs by the government, although it was prevalent in the past. But nowadays, the government's policy has changed and all graduates must find his [pr1, 1-3] job by his own effort. This stimulates the competitions in the job market and help companies to choose the most promising applicants. And I think it takes [wd7, 1-] a great advantage to economic development.	However, since school and college leavers have to look for jobs by themselves, the difficulties to find a suitable position increase. In China, the work-force is large and there are too many labors. In addition, like Britain, with the closedown of old factories, the number of laid-off [fm2, 1-]is also rising. Quite amout [wd3, 1-] of people face the unemployment problems. On the other hand, with development of our country, the society is in great need of fully-educated trainer [wd7, 1-] and advanced experts. In that case, if you want to be employed and has a good status, you [vp9, -1] may be qualified and have real capacity. On the whole, I am optimistic about China's employment conditions. And I believe we can solve the problems with the advancement of our society. Do you satisfy [sn8,s] with my answer? Hope your brother find a good job soon.

In fact, nowadays, more and more Chinese school leavers have the same problem as your younger brother had. It's difficult to find a suitable job in China too. The situation that school leavers will [vp6,s-] be all automatically allocated jobs by the government has changed a lot. Most schools and colleges leavers have to find jobs by themselves. They have their own choices. And at the same time they are choosen [fm1,-] by the companies. Only some special professional students are allocated jobs by the government. Such as soldiers, teachers.[sn2,s]	Because of the overpopulation problem in China, the young have problems finding work.. A lot of people compete together [wd5, 1-] for one job, of course some of them will lose. And since the whole world economic situation became [vp6,s-] worse, some Chinese state-owned or private enterprises are closing down, less and [aj3, 2-1]less opportunities can be offered to young people .The unemployment rate is increasing. In [wd5, 1-] thus, Chinese young people have to worry about their jobs in the future.	But I really hope this situation will be changed in the following years.																Yours,

The educational level have [vp3, 1-] increased rapidly. Many school leaver [np3, 1-] with high education and skill training come into the society.

The school leavers did not worry about the employment. While nowadays, the school and college leavers have many choices. They can find job [np6, 1-] themselves or [sn8,s] by government. The opportunity of employment is not as many as before. It also appear [vp3, 1-] the difficulty [sn8,s] of finding a good job like in Britain.

July 9th, 1997Dear Peter,	I'm sorry to hear that your younger brother can't get a job now. Since you are interested in the job market in China, I'd like to tell you something about it.	Compared with Britain, the situation in China is better. Take Guangzhou for instance. Guanghou is the South Gate of China, and it has a booming business owing to the opening-door policy in which inflows many foreign enterprises to invest.[sn7,s] Actually, the overall situation of China will follow it.	Regarding Chinese school and college graduates, they usually find jobs by themselves rather than [sn6, s] government nowadays. The government believes that mutural [fm1,-] choice will lead to mutural [fm1,-] benefit between the employers and employees. People who are capable and have comprehensive knowledge always have many choices. In this case, the job market becomes more and more competitive. But, some young people do have some problems in finding work [wd3, 1-] if they are little enducated [fm1,-] and lack of relevant experience. Thus, most of the youth have to study hard in order to be competitive enough after graduation.															Yours sincerely,																	Linda

That's not true that Chinese school and college leavers are all automatically allocated jobs by the government. A few years ago, the policy had [vp6,s-] changed. Now, the school leavers have to find jobs themselves. The problem of unemployment in China is grim. A lot of companies have reduced the number of staff [wd3, 1-].

I will leave school in two years. Most of my classmates are worring [fm1,-] about the problem of finding work [wd3, 1-]. As college leavers, we hope to find a good job--high salary and good promoting chances. But this is not a easy thing because of the competition.

Not allocating jobs automatically by the government like years ago [sn8,s], graduates are hunting their jobs before graduation. Whether they can apply for a prosperous jobs [np3, 3-] depends on their college knowledge and skills. I think this is the same [wd7, 1-1] demands in Britain.	With China's open policy, more and more foreigners invest in China. As a result, these companies provide great opportunities for people. They can choose their jobs according to their likeness [wd3, 1-]. As we all know that China is a large country and has a prosperous future, most investors are confident about the expansion of their companies and promote [sn8,s] a lot of cooperation.

Many young people find it difficult to get a job, including those college students. Since the assignment system has changed, the school and college leavers would not be automatically allocated jobs by the goverment [fm1,-]. They have to look for jobs themselves through advertisment [fm1,-], relations and so on. The new system is up to date because both side [np3, 1-] can have the right to chose [fm1,-] and decide. Once a person choose [vp3, 1-] his job, he will do it for his life, especially mid-age [fm1,-] people, they don't have many choices to find anther job.	Considering the reasons for the tough situation, I think overpopulation is one fator [fm1,-], the other is that many old state-owned factories are in bad condition, they can't afford any more employors [wd7, 1-]. However, I believe situation will [vp7, 1-1] changed. I wish your brother will find a good job sooner [aj3, 1-].														Yours sincerely															Dengjian

There are many students graduating from high schools and universities. They are eager to find jobs. But it is difficult for the state to provide so many positions for them. Many of them become redundant [wd7, 1-] in the job market. And the competition between people at work and people looking for jobs is drastic. People live in [pp1, 1-] high pressure.	Though the situation in China is not so good, students graduating from colleges still have choice about the jobs they do. The schools where they study give them [sn8,s] recommendation to companies. The manager of the companies can arrange a [np7, 1-] interview between them. Both of them have right to choose.	Now, Hongkong has reverted [wd3, 1-] to China.

Several years ago, college leavers are [vp6,s-] mostly automatically allocated jobs by the government, including office jobs, factory jobs, etc. They have [vp6,s-] rather good welfare, but not high salary. And they have [vp6,s-] to summit [wd7, 1-] to the decision of the government.	Nowadays, things have changed. College leavers may find the jobs they like [wd3, -1] first. If they succeed in finding one, the college will not meddle in, nor will the government. While if they fail, the college will help them .I am delighted to say that most college leavers would [vp6,s-] get a job.	However, not many youths can enter college, for China has a large population. They graduate from technical schools or high [aj1, 1-1] middle schools. So they will have troubles in finding a good job. Luckily, as the economy develops, [sn8,s] using foreign capitals by joint-vetures [fm1,-], most of them manage to have a job. So, the unemployment problem is less serious than before.

They are [vp6,s-] required to obey the allocation of their schools whether they like [vp6,s-] or not. and the companies were also required to accept them as their employees.	About two years ago, the policy had [vp6,s-] began to change under the requirement of both the graduates and the companies. Now, the rights to find a job and to refuse a graduate are granted to the graduates and the companies. This is a progress, I think. Graduates can do the job they like, and companies need not accept graduates who they consider unnecessary.	Certainly, it will be much more competitive to find a job now in China. But with a good capability, it is not very difficult to find a job yet. There are a lot of opportunities in my country, that's what I think.

John Major The North East Lilk Company U.K.												 July 8th, 1997Dear John, 	I'm glad to hear from you but I feel sorry about the situation you brother is facing because there's nothing I can do about it.	Comparing the situation here with that in Britain, I should say, the situation is much more [aj3, 1-] better. Most of the school and college leavers can get a job after graduation. Since the policy of allocating jobs automatically by the government has changed in some way, the situation is different now. As to the vocational school graduates, the goverment [fm1,-] will still assign jobs to them. While the college leavers have to go to interview [wd3, 1-] with some companies to find jobs themselves, just as people in Britain do. Of course, the new policy will provide more choices of job to people, but, on the other hand, people are compelled to decide their own fate. Also, this policy is good for the proper distribution of manpower. The main problem among people is that the gap between their relatively high standard of promising job [sn8,s]and their inadequate ability to that job. But in the end, they will make a choice. That's just a brief introduction of the present situation.	I hope your brother will sort out some way himself soon.																	Yours,																	 Chen Mei

July 9, 1997Dear Jack,	I'm glad to hear from you before I have the summer holiday. It's my pleasure for me to give you some information concerning your questions.	As far as I know, our government's policy towards graduates have [vp3, s-] been changed since 1995. Yes, Chinese school and college leavers were automatically allocated jobs by the government then. And graduates had little choice about the jobs they did. They had to accept the jobs even they were not interested in them. But things changed. Nowadays graduates must find jobs by themselves and the colleges just give some suggestions. The graduates have the right to choose their jobs and also, the companies or the enterprises could [vp6,s-] choose their [wd3, -1] employers. You know our China is a very big developing country, it is a populous country, too. Each year there are a great number of graduates looking for job. So it is important for the job-hunters that they must make sure they are fit for the job.	I hope my information will be of some help for you. Please give my best regards to your family and I will be pleased to hear that your brother get [vp3, 1-] a job soon.																	Yours,																		Jean

About what you asked, I'll give you some idea below.	Compared with Britain, I think, China has [vp1, 1-2] less unemployment. But it is not the truth that Chinese school and college leavers are all automatically allocated jobs by the government. The fact is, for most Chinese college leavers, they must hunt a job by themselves. And also, they have a free choice about the jobs they do. They try their best to seek a most suitable job and at any time, if they don't like, they can change their work freely. Nowadays, it is also not easy to find a suitable job for college leavers in China. Too much [aj1, 1-1] population and great competition make job-hunting difficult. And our government is always doing its best to set up a good condition for people of all walks of life to have a good job.	I hope your younger brother can find a good job in near future. Best wishes!																Yours,																	Helena

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>,o                          July 9th, 1997Dear, 	I'm glad to receive you letter.	Considering your questions, I would like to say the situation of jobs is not good. There are more job applicants, but fewer positions.	It was true that school and college leavers were all automatically allocated jobs by the government, but it is not the case nowadays. Allocating jobs had disadvantages. So with the development of economy and the enforcement of open door policy, China's government isn't responsible for allocating jobs. Leavers will have jobs in accordance with their own free wills. I think it is a great development.	But it is not easy to find a job. And people have not much choice about jobs. As you can see, China's [np4, 1-] has a large population. Overpopulation causes serious social problems. Unemployment is one . There are more leavers than job markets need every year, especially recently. Present leavers were born during the period of baby boom, that is from the foundation of New China to the enforcement of "one family, one child" policy. Too much workforce in job market causes unemployment, because most companies are full of employees.	So I think after graduation, I also have to spend much time finding a job.	I hope your younger brother can find a job.															Yours.																Hu Ying

As for the situation in China, I am afraid nowadays it is a bit difficult for people without experiences to find a job, especially for those who graduate from middle schools. For college graduates, the situation is better, but hey [fm1,-] will not have the privilege to be automatically allocated jobs any more. They have to find jobs themselves. In the past the number of college students was small, so they had the privilege. But nowadays with the increasing number of college graduates, even the college graduates cannot find a good job easily. In the past because college graduates were allocated jobs by the government, they ahd [fm1,-] almost no choice about their jobs. The government would consider their willingnesses [wd3, 1-], but they must [vp6,s-] obey the allocation. Now according to the new allocation system, graduates can choose their favourite companies and the companies can choose graduates freely.	I think the present situation in China is better for young people than old people, but wherever you are, a certification of education is a necessisity [fm1,-] for a job.	Hope my answers will be useful for you and your brother will find a good job soon.																Yours,																 Luo Ya-fang

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, 3???Dear Johns,	After reading your letter, I share the same feeling as yours. In the past few years, it was true that Chinese school and college leavers were automatically allocated jobs by the government. But now this polocy [fm1,-] has changed. We university students get no guerantee [fm1,-] that we can surely have a job after graduation. And those high-school leavers find even more difficulties in find [fm1,-] a job, just because that [wd5, 1-] they are not well educated [wd5, -1]enough. China now is one [fm1,-] the way of realising [fm1,-] her modernation [fm1,-]. More and more people of high quality are require [vp7, 1-] in the job market. That's why the situation has changed. And our concept of job has changed, too. We no longer expect to find a job where we stay for decades. If people can find a job with more opportunities, they will resign their present job. Losing jobs and changing jobs are common in China now.	Although the situation is not [wd3, -1] easy, we need not worry if we have high qualities. So many people are willing to receive high education and some working people go to evening school [np6, s-]. Several years ago, no one was willing to receive post-graduate education because it wouldn't be of much use in the job market. But now many graduates attend the exam for post-graduate educations [np5, 1-]. I think the trend is leading our society to cultivate more high-quality people and this is partially contributable [fm2, 1-] to the job market which is providing more and more jobs requiring high skills.																Yours																	Michael

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ?Dear friend,	Just to the opposite, the situation in China is far from optimistic. The concept that Chinese school and college leaver [np6, 1-] are all automatically allocated jobs by the government, is inappropriate. Nowadays, a lot of college leavers have to find their jobs by themselves.	These years, China does have [vp6,s-] had a great economic achivements [fm1,-]. But, the competition in the job market become [vp3, 1-] so keen as well. There are many people in the list waiting [vp2, 1-] the job opportunaty [fm1,-]. Those who don't have [sn8,s] well-educated would in a worse situation. 	As you know, China is famous for its large population. And this year the economic development seems to be a bit slow. Furthermore, the market-oriented economy spurs great competitions between enterprizes [fm1,-]. Those which are ineffeciently [fm1,-] managed or lacking of fresh information are closing down. [sn7,s]A lot of factories, especially whose [sn8,s] are called "state-own light industry", are in a dangrous [fm1,-] situation. Anyway, our situation is no better than yours. Only have we got very excellent records in college and social experience, we can be competitive in the job market.															Yours sincerely,																	John

I have to say we are faced with the same situation. According to statistics, there are 12 million people, rural and urban, who are out of work. Mostly they are from failing state-owned enterprises where fresh skills are needed. Some are vocational school leavers due to the surplus of labor for the same industry.	Graduates used to have jobs allocated by the government. However, things have changed since market-oriented economy was introduced. There is a double-direction [fm2, 1-] process of getting a job. That is, you can choose a company to work for, or you can be chosen by a company. In spite of the alarming situation, I am still optimistic about the employment outlook. With Hong Kong's return to Chinese administration, which is followed by Macao in 2 years, more money will be invested in mailand [fm1,-] and more enterprises will be set up , thus more jobs are to be created. Young people, especially college graduates are supposed not [ad1, 1-] to have difficulty finding jobs.	I hope your bother can get a good job very soon.																Yours																	Ken

I know that unemployment ratio is rather high in many countries, so finding a job is of course critical thing for the graduates.	In China, our situation is relatively [wd5, 1-] better. Graduates from colleges are needed by many joint-ventures and new companies. It is not the story that Chinese school and college leavers are all automatically allocated jobs by the government. Every May or June, a lot of company [np3, 4-] go into the colleges to meet the applicants. Many graduates can find their favorite job by that way. But that is also depended much on the deputy [wd7, 1-] of the college and [sn6, s] which department you studied [vp6,s-] in .Many young people have problems finding work [wd3, 1-] in China, that is true. I heard that the profitable companies often choose the applicant very [wd7, -1] throughly [fm1,-]. They consider not only the academic degree but also the work experience. So it is very hard to enter this kind of company [np6, 1-]. 	I hope that your brother can find a good job soon. 															Yours Russell

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, 1??Dear friend, I'm glad on the receipt of your letter. In it you described the serious job situation in your country. In my opinion, the situation in China is a bit better. The first thing I want to tell you is that, our Chinese school and college leavers are NOT "all automatically allocated jobs". As to us college students nowadays, after graduation the chance to find a job mostly depends on our efforts and, what's more, on the qualities of ourselves. Several years ago, the government did help the graduats [fm1,-] to get a job. But now things have changed. The government adopted another method to help to solve the problem, that is, to organize meeting between the job applicants and the companies or factories. Thus it provides the graduates a way to seek a job. On the other hand, with the increasing number of college graduats [fm1,-], the way is not so smooth as before. Those who are only high school leavers or who have no experience often find it not easy to be hired. Without the cirtificate [fm1,-] of high qualification or some skills and experience, you will be refused by the employers. That's something like what you said. All in one, in anywhere and at anytime, the qualities and skills you own is vital element [np6, 1-]. Yours, Green.

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ??1/4?                            August, 9thDear Mike,	I'm glad to hear from you and hope your younger brother will get a satisfactory job soon.	The problem of employment is also serious in China. With the reform [wd7, 1-] of marketing [wd3, 1-1] economy, many employees in state-run enterprises have lost their jobs. For our college kids, even with a degree, there is no guaranttee [fm1,-] of a job. Hopefully, the government will resolve the problem in the coming 15th conference. The coastal cities in the southeast are of better condition. The reform and open-up policy provides quite a lot [np2,-] job vacancies, which attracts millions of workers to work there.	As to the "automatically allocated jobs" you mentioned, the system still exist [vp3, 4-], but can not meet the need of all the students. More and more graduates prefer to go to the job market, where they can compete with others for better jobs. I think every student can have a job if he follows the state allocation, because many remote areas in China, such as Tibet or Ganshu [fm1,-], are in great need of teachers, workers and medical staff. But nor [fm1,-] many people are willing to go there due to poor circumstances. Youngsters like to have free choice in job hunting. We are still young, and must try out best to get a job which will give us pleasure and challenge. Ask you brother not to worry. I'm sure he will get a decent job in the near future.

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, "??Dear Peter:	Hello. I am glad to hear from you again.	I am sorry to know that the situation in your country is so bad. While in China, with the open-door reform policy, the economic [wd2, 1-] is booming [wd5, -1] fast. Since the early 1980's, our country has attracked [fm1,-] a great deal of foreign investments and introduced the most advanced techology [fm1,-] and management method in the world.	The undergraduates in the university are all confident with their future. Actually, the method of automatically allocated jobs by the government is no longer in operation. Nowadays, all the college leavers go directly to the job market to hunt jobs according [pp2,1-] their special talent and own will. They could compete fairly in the job market where the "back-door" no longer exist [vp3, s-]. This, at the same time, encourage [vp3,5-] the university students to keep an eye on the society's need when they are studying hard on the campus. It seems there is no difficulty for these young people to get a job. Since they are all well educated, which are correctly what the society needs.	Now, in order to get a good job with decent pay in the future. [sn9, s] I'm [vp6,s-1] study hard and try to make myself fit for the society. Write to me if you still get [wd3, 1-] any question about China. I hope that your brother would [vp6,s-] soon find his job.	Yours															Huang Xiang

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, "?D???	I'm very sorry to know what happened to your younger brother and hope that he will find a good job as soon as possible.	In China there is a quite different situation in the job market compared with Britain. Young people do not worry much about finding jobs actually [sn9, s] although unemployment has occured [fm1,-] in China gradually. Many factories and companies [vp7, -1] set up nowadays as China's economy is developing rapidly. How to find a good job, rather than how to find a job, become [vp3, 1-] the main concern of Chinese school and college leavers. Having a lot of choices after graduation, they are not necessarily allocated jobs by the government. Many of them prefer to apply for a more suitable job by themselves.	However, the situation is not always satisfatory [fm1,-]. One problem in China's job market is that for those without a good education background, it is not so easy to find a job. Because physical works are not widely needed in China nowadays. [sn2,s]

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ???	The situation in China is probably better than [sn4, s] Britain. It is true that the college leaveres [fm1,-] would get jobs allocated by the government years ago. But nowadays this regulation has already abandoned for it brought many bad effects on the students themselves and the enterprises as well.	Young people in China also have great difficulties finding jobs. It is reported that only 50% of students who graduated from vocational schools this year can find work [wd3, 1-]. But chances for college graduates to be employed are much greater [wd3, 1-]. For example, all the 4th year students in our English department were able to find their statisfied [aj4, 1-] jobs 2 months before they end their college course. And most students in other universities managed to find jobs through their hard jobs-huntings [fm2, 1-].	I believe the situation of finding jobs in China are [vp3, 1-] largely depended on the economy. If the economy is on the stump, less [aj3, 1-] graduates are needed, while the economy is gradually recovered, students have less [aj3, 1-] problems finds [sn8,s] work. And China is exactly in the latter situation. And I predict that this recovering process will continue for at least 4 years, and the total number of unemployment will be decreased considerably.	Nowadays Tony Blare is in office, I hope he will make his promise that no Britain school and college leavers should be unemployed come true. And your younger brother will surely find a job.

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, YD??1/4	In China, the problem of unemployment is getting worse and worse. In recent years, our country's economic [wd2, 1-] does [vp6,s-1] advance greatly, but the side effect of it is that with the replacement of new machines and new manage [wd2, 1-] system, a large number of dated [wd7, 1-] workers are removed from factories. As you know, China is a country with a large population. Each year, there are so [sn8,s] new faces appearing in job market that it is difficult to deal with them in a satisfatory [fm1,-] way.	As far as students are concerned, allocation by government has been an old stories [np3,1-]. Of course, we have many choices of jobs as long as you [pr1, s-] have all-round abilities. It is a rather hard time to many school leavers after graduation, but some people who have good relation with the big fish of some companies or personnel office are much more relexed [fm1,-] to find a job. You know, one of my classmate can't get a steady job in two years after leaving school. This year, there are still many graduates wandering in the job market nervously.

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ?																July, 9thDear XX:	I have heard from you that finding jobs in Britain is difficult. Similarly, I must say, hunting jobs in China is not as easy as before either.	In recent years, most of college leavers have to find a job themselves. There are two main reasons: firstly, the population of China becomes too large, and the government can not allocate everyone a job. As our country's economy develops, various new jobs have appeared. School and college graduates want to choose a more suitable job themselves.	As more and more competitors involves [vp3, 1-] in the job market, finding a job become difficult. Many students have to start hunting jobs even a year before their graduation. To prevent from being unemployed, students use every mean [wd3,s-] to made [vp5,1-] themselves competitive. They try to learn more from books and at the same time gain more experiences form some part-time jobs.	Nowadays, young people in China do have many problems in finding work [wd3, 1-]. But if you study and work harder, you'll get a better result.															Yous [fm1,-] ever XX

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ??	Compared with Britain [sn4, s], the situation in China is much better. Unemployed rate of young people is lower than that in your country. The government seldom allocates jobs to [sn8,s]the graduates jobs to the graduates from colleges or universities. But they can find jobs by themselves in the job market. The school leavers can act as blue collar workers. You know in recent years there are a lot of join-venture companies and foreign investment companies established in China, and they are in great need of workers. It is not difficult to have to job, if you do not mind what kind of job it is.	If your aim is to find a well-paid and suitable job, unless you are really top ones, it will be heard [fm1,-]. Now in our country, men outnumbers women in getting better jobs, and graduates of hot-majors get high-paid jobs easier than those of cold-majors. Some people have to accept the jobs which have nothing in common with what they have learned in schools or colleges. Fortunately, this phenomenon is not common.

I hope he can get a job soon.	As I see it, such situation also exists in China. Especially in these recent years, it's not as easy as before to get a job. Yes, in the past, all school and college leavers are [vp6,s-] automatically allocated jobs by the government. But not now. Graduated students are entitiled [fm1,-]the chance to choose their jobs and at the same time, they are selected by the companies or enterprices [fm1,-] etc [sn9, s] according to their courses majored at school. Furthermore, it's becoming to [sn8,s] have more employees than needed that the opportunity of gaining a job is lessening. In addition, many employers require those who apply for a job should have certain working experience . So this adds to the difficulty for the young people to be employed.However, since China is concerned about her modernization construction, and with the further implementation of the reform policy, I think a potential job market will be created and this problem will be solved.	All the best.														Yours ...

<ST 5>, <SEX ?>, <Y ?>, <SCH GIFL>, <AGE ?>, <WAY 1>, <DIC 2>, <TYP ?>, ?"Y??	Actually, China shares the same situation with Britain. Nowadays, not only school and college leavers, but those who are lacking in skills and [wd7, -1] methods, find it difficult to [sn8,s] hunt a job. In the last two decades, China's education has [vp6,s-] developed dramatically. A great number of college students emerge [vp6,s-] in all walks of life, with technical skill and knowledge. They can [vp6,s-] be easily enrolled at that time by work units and companies. But now, things have been changed a lot. With more and more college students swarm into society, especially in tapped areas such as the coastal area in South-east China, skillful workmen with college certification are abundant. While in north-west of China, which still remains unexploited [fm2, 1-], few students are willing to go to work there. This causes inbalance [fm2, 1-] in distribution of labour in China.	In the past, it was true that Chinese college and school students were all automatically allocated jobs by the government . But now, the situation has been changed. Most of the college leavers of my generation have to find a job themselves. Though some people think it always brings about many traumatic experience, I think it offers us more choices about the jobs we do. In other words, it is more flexible for the employees to find a satisfactory job.	I will graduate in the [wd5, 1-1]next two years. I feel optimistic about my future though the society is full of so [wd5, 1-1] much severe compition [fm1,-] because I think more compition [fm1,-] means more progress.

But it's the very time that I have my final test. Afterward, I'll be a junior college student. However, I begin [sn8,s] worry about my future.	Like in Britain, it become [vp3,1-] more and more difficult for some school leavers to find a job. It's quite competitive here. A lot of companies and factories present tough and [fm1, -1] strick requirement to the applicants. It used to be the school's responsibility to help the student [np6, s-] find a job. But nowadays, it's not the case anymore. It's up to the students themselves to apply for a job. With the great development in the education, there is an increasing number of colledge [fm1,-3] students. So colledge students have no advantage in finding a job because all the other components are just at the same level. Therefore, academic record and working experience become extremely important. All the students must focus on studying and try every means to get a part-time job during the holiday with a view to getting some working experience.	The situation in China may be better than in Britain. At least we do not have such a high rate of unemployment . But it surely stuns you as it's quite contrary to what you imagined before. Anymore, I do hope your brother can find a job soon.													Yours faithfully,													wen [fm3, 1-] Tianqing

As school and college leavers in China are increasing dramatically, it's really a tough task for them to find a suitable job in the job market. Nowadays, graduates are not likely allocated jobs by the government as they were in the past. Most of them prefer to hunt jobs through other channels. For example, they will probably manage to find jobs by applying for a post in companies or, in other cases, through recommendations of friends and relatives. As for those who want to gain experience before embarking on the society, they usually look for part-time jobs either on vocation or during school period thus [sn8,s]make things much easier. In general, nobody would get a job without any difficulty for [sn8,s]the heated competition among the college leavers.

As you have mentioned about the unemployment situation in China, I'm afraid I haven't any available statistics at hand for you, but, as far as I know, Chinese unemployment situation is as grim as [sn4, s] Britain.	In China, there are several elements [sn8,s] lead to unemployment . One of them is the economic recession. More and more factories and industries couldn't [vp6,s-] earn enough money for running . Consequently, they have no way to do but close down themselves. Another one is the technology development. because [fm3, 1-] of the invention and development of computers , more and more automatic work can be done by machines. In addition, computers are much more efficient than workforce. On [pp1, 1-] this condition, more and more people begin to lose their jobs and have to find a new one. Certification of the applicants is also an important element. The higher educational level you have, the easylier [fm1,-] you could [vp6,s-] find a comfortable job. On [pp1, 1-] that case, certification is more important than experience, [sn9, s] Maybe there is a slight different between China and Britain at the point.

 Patriotism      Patriotism means the love of one's country.  It makes one ready to sacrifice his life for his country, and to do many other deeds which can bring benefits to his people.  It makes a country strong and her history glorious.  It also improves a man's character and secures for him widespread fame.     To love our country means the fulfilment of one's  [pr1,8-] duty and obligations.  To maintain the stability and unity of our country, one [pr1,9-]  should work hard so as to make her strong and rich, support her government, obey her laws, pay taxes -- this is to be a real Chinese patriot.     If the people of a country are not patriotic, the country must be very weak.  History tells us how some countries of ancient times were, owing to lack of patriotism, conquered by other peoples and how the people of the conquered countries were made slaves under the yoke of thier [fm1,-]  victorious masters.

However, as I am now doing some translation and compilation work in London, I am afraid that the work will not be finished until August,  1997.  therefore,  I would like to suggest that the appointment be made from 1 September. 1997 to 31 August, 1999.

To a city as highly-developed and commercialised as Guangzhou, transportation is most important.  To most people's joy, transportation in Guangzhou is not bad.     Among the various means of transportation in Guangzhou, the most common one is the bicycle.  Bicycles play an important role in the life [np5,-3]  of the Cantonese.  It is estimated that millions of bicycles are in use in Guangzhou, forming a magnificent picture. A lot of people go to work by bicycle.  alternatively, some people make use of buses, which are also an important means of transportation. [sn7,7-]   Countless buses, like huge insects, crawl on the wide roads in Guangzhou, providing its citizens with great conveniences [np5,5-] .  It is more convenient to take a taxi, though, [sn9,-]  it is more costly.  There are numerous taxi companies in Guangzhou; they do their contribution [vp2,2-1]  to the city's transportation.  Recently, the underground has been built in Guangzhou, this undoubtedly enhance the citizens' conveniences greatly. [sn1,s]  There are also other means of transportation, such as motorcycles and tricycles. They, too, with other means of transportation, make Guangzhou a more attractive and admirable city.   Although there are various means of transportation in Guangzhou, this [pr1,9-]  is not enough.  Other modernised and advanced means of transportation should still be introduced to Guangzhou. Thus, Guangzhou can live up to its title -- a Modernised [fm3,-]  International [fm3,-]  City [fm3,-] .

<ST 5><SEX 2><Y 8><SCH Zhongda><AGE 21><WAY 1><DIC ><TYP 1>                             Study Problems    Students are constantly encounting [fm1,-]  study problems.  today I am going to focus on one point -- how to adjust one's motion to study and learn efficiently.     As a student, I share the common attitude towards study with most fellows.  I find study boring on the whole.  Sometimes I am too lazy to touch the books; sometimes I am in depression [pr3, 4-3]  and just want to sit and do nothing; sometimes such attractive things as wonderful TV programs or going shopping are of greater lure to me.  However, if I let these personal factors bother me and take mastery of me [sn9,-]  I will absolutely learn nothing at all.  Therefore, it is necessary and vital to find a good solution.  I find that a person need [vp3,2-]  some relaxation periodically. When in depression, just stop to relax the mind completely by listening to the music, seeing a movie or having other entertainment.  After that, draw up a new plan and devote to [vp2,1-3]  a new task.  If bothered by things like wanting to go shopping instead of study, make sure to finish the work required as quickly as possible and properly as well, then grant yourself freedom as a [np7,-1]  incentive. [sn8,s] I always find it [pr1,-8]  effective when I am studying under an encouragement.  Otherwise, if I keep studying regardless of my emotions, it proves to be futile.        As to this same study problem, solutions varies [vp3,1-]  from person to person.  The most important thing is to adjust oneself to study effectivley [fm1,-] .

These problems exit [wd3,2-]  in every aspects [np5,1-]  of studies, especially in listening and speaking.     We can not understand what speakers say while listening, mainly because we can not follow the speakers.  Since our vocabulary is limited, we have to guess the meaning [np5,-3]  of some words, and this takes time.  At the meanwhile [pp2,2-] , the speakers, usually native speakers, are [wd5,5-2]  generally speak at a normal speed, which seems a bit fast to non-native speakers.  Thus, we may neglect [wd3,2-6]  some main points in the lecture. Therefore, we will not catch the meaning of the speaker.  We can not follow the speakers also because we do not understand the ascents [fm1,-] , which cause [vp3,1-6]  the same word sounds [vp4,5-2]  almost different.  Speaking problems occur also because of our small vocabulary.  We often use words repeatedly, which makes our conversation dull and simple.  We can not express exactly  and clearly what we think, since we seldom practise and are too shy to speak.  After class, we hardly speak English in our daily life.  Being afraid of making mistakes and being laughed at are also the troubles.     If we can not solve the speaking and listening problems, we may have a hard time in further studies.  In my opoin [fm1,-] , speaking and listening should be put on the same level with writing and reading.

But here, I just only discuss [vp6,3-]it from two points: study what and how to study.    As students of university, what should we study?  Of course, we should study our textbooks at[wd4,-] above all.  In  order to make a living and build our country, we must have some skills and maste [fm1,-]  some major knowledge [cc3,3-] .  We learn all of these [pr1,7-]  from textbooks.  But that is not enough.  We should broaden our horizons in many different directions [wd3,-] , so we must read all kinds of books, such as the [np7,9-1]  novels, the [np7,10-2]  scientific books, newspapers, and so on. Thus we'll become a wit person [cc1,-1] , but not a bookswarm [fm1,-] .   Then, the second question: how to study.  To[wd3,-] the major knowledge, we can listen to the teacher in the class and study it in our spare-time [fm2,-] .  We have no problems about studying textbooks.  But how to learn the other knowledge [cc3,3-] ? In my pinion [fm1,-] , first, we should know what kind of knowledge we are interested in most, and then, we can  read the books about it or learn from the others who are good at it.  Or we feel what kind of knowledge we lack and then learn it more.[sn8,s]     In a word, studying is one's own business.  We should learn knowledge [cc3,1-]  as much as we can and as active [ad2,11-3]  as we can.  Knowledge is not limited, and we should study, study and study until we die.

Among those problems, I think there are mainly three important problems [wd6,s-] .     First, how to master what we have learned. [sn8,s] The purpose of us students to come to the school is to abtain [fm1,-]  knowledge, so it's important to master the knowledge [cc3,2-] .  Even [cj1,-7]  we read through the text-book several times, listen to the teacher attentively, take all kinds of exams, sometimes we still learn nothing.  For example, I learned chemistry for 3 years and I passed all the exams in middle school, I can't remember a thing about it now.  While [wd3,-s]  I learned to count when I was three, I still can count.  I think the reason of the different results of my learning lie [vp3,9-]  in whether I master the skill. When I learned chemistry, I didn't master it, I just memorized it. [sn1,s]     Second, how to use what we have learned. [sn8,s]  Using [wd3,-5]  is more important than studying.  As a forieg [fm1,-]  language student, the most essential thing for me is to use my second  language to communicate with others.  There are many people can read difficult essays in English but can't write or speak themselves [wd5,3-2]  in English. [sn8,s]   If we can't use what we learn, studying is meaningless.  I think the only way to use our knowledge is to practice it in daily life.    Third, the least important one but necessary for a student, how to get high marks. [sn8,s] Though high marks do not stand for our ability, they do give us more chance [np6,1-]  when we having [vp4,2-2]  an interview and showing our certifications [wd3,2-] .     I think to get high marks, we need to digest the textbook thoroughly and do more relevant exercise [np6,3-] .       Though these three study problems are quite different, but [cj1,8-4]  they have some connection.  If we want to get high marks, we need to digest what we learned [vp4,13-] ; and it will help us to master the essence of the knowledge [cc3,5-] ; [sn9,-] therefore, we can use our knowledge more easily and freely.

A patriotic person will do anything for his motherland, even to die. In the history of our nation, there are numerous patriotic persons, such as Yuefei, Zhen cheng gong and Li zhe qu. The general meaning of patriotism is the same, however, the definition of it in different eras varies.     In acient [fm1,-]  China, the definition of patriotism was to devote oneself to the emperor and to the fudal [fm1,-]  society. You can compare what Yuefei had done with what Li zhe qu had done. Even though they fought against the foreign invaders and they defended our nation, their aim was to maintain the fudal [fm1,-]  society. On the other hand, the patriotism of the revolutionary period is quite different. The patriotic persons armed themselves and fought against foreign invaders, strifing [wd2,-4]  with the antirevolutionary army. What they have done was to liberate the working class, to liberate our whole nation, not for a man, but for every Chinese. The definition of patriotism had been developed and advanced.     Now we've been [vp6,2-7]  in the new era of socialist construction, therefore the definition of patriotism is different from others. To make our country better and stronger is the exact definition of patriotism at [pp2,-2]  present  time.

I would like to accept it, but would it be possible to do [cc3,-3]  a little change: the appointment to be [vp4,6-1]  made instead from 1st September, 1997, to 31st August, 1999? Because I have to complete work in translation and compilation already in progress in London [sn2, s-] .    I am honored and appreciated [wd2,4-5]  to be offered this appointment, and hope my work in London  will be of great benefit to you and to the institute in any teaching, translation, interpretation, or compilation work I may be called upon to do.     Looking forward to hearing from you.  Yours sincerely,                                                           Robert Lee     

<ST 5><SEX 2><Y 8><SCH Zhongda><AGE 21><WAY 1><DIC 1><TYP 1>                            Study Problems      "What about the result of your final exam?" Often, parents would ask such question when they try to show their care to their children's study. However, they don't, actually, understand those study problems lying before [wd3,4-2] their children, so they don't know how to care or help them efficiently. The four problems listed as following [pr1,1-]  may be helpful to such parents.    Firstly, as the old saying goes: "Interest is the best teacher." ,lack of interests [np5,2-4]  is the biggest problem. [sn1,s] Usually, that children get low marks in school is not only due to children themselves or teachers, but also parents.[sn8,s] Because, they failed to help to [wd5,1-1]  form their child's interests in their childhood [sn2,s-] .  Secondly, lack of aims also is [wd1,4-3]  a big problem, which leads to the third problem -- lack of persistance [fm1,-] . To set up an aim can stimulate children's desire to study, and to keep the aim will make them persist to [wd3,-]  the study. finally [fm3,-], lack of practice may be the last but not the least problem. Practice should be an important part of study, but often be [vp8,10-3]  neglected by people. For example, to learn English needs lots of practice, Nowadays, most parents realize the importance of English and try to teach their children at their early age [np5,3-] . They encourage their son or daughter to remember lots of words but forget to lead them [pr1,13-]  to use them. All these problems retard [vp1,3-6]  children from good results in study.     In a word, if parents have learned these study problems of their children, and try to care [vp1,-13]  more "What's the problem you recently met with?" than the marks and results, they will be more welcomed and helpful to their children.

There were so many things that made this trip a most pleasant one: the beautiful country scene, the soft [cc4,-1]  sunlight, the refreshing wind, and most of all, the dramatic reforms in my hometown.     My family house greatly surprised me by transforming itself from a shabby and grimmy [fm1,-]  "hut" into a two-floor, air-conditioned house, glistening under the sun.  On entering the spacious sitting-room, I was surrounded by warm greetings, happy laughters, and the exciting news about the reforms in the hometown.  Own [pp2,-s] to the good policies from the Communist Paty, my family bought the two little hills at the back of the house, and planted mango trees there.  "It's a lot of labour involved", said my grandfather, as his weathered face cracked a big smile, but it's well worth it!" "The little hills where I played when I was a little kid?"  my face lighted up and I ran out of the house to the hills.  The two little hills, once barren and full of rocks were covered by a carpet of mango trees, with heavy, yellow mangos dotted [vp5,4-6]  in a sea of green trees, I was excited and became move [vp5,5-]  so when grandfather told me that they newly [wd3,3-6]  had tap water in the hometown, a new power plant was built and the construction of 2 first-class inter-province highways was underway [fm2,-] . [sn1,s]    "What a great reform?"  I chanted, and believed this was just the beginning, as I saw a banch [fm1,-]  of kids, dressed neatly in uniforms, flooded [vp5,11-4]  into a modern school.

<ST 5><SEX 2><Y 8><SCH Zhongda><AGE 21><WAY 1><DIC 1><TYP 1>                 Modernization in China   Now China is still a developing country, and our country's great goal is to become a developed socialism [wd2,-1]  country. In order that the goal can become realie [fm1,-] , modernization in our country is very necessary.   Modernization includes many aspects, such as the modernization of agriculture, the modernization of industry and so on. The most apparent feature of the modernization of agriculture and industry is the increase of the number of their products. Therefore, the goods in markets become more and more, and people's various needs can also be met well.  People can live a steady life, so that our country has good atomasphare [fm1,-]  for development. To increase the number of products, we must make full use of our resources. In our country [sn9,-]  most resources are spread [wd3,3-1]  everywhere, including remote areas and some areas that [pr5,s-]  the trasportation [fm1,-]  is convenient. In order to use the rich resources in the remote areas, we must build many new roads and adopt many advanced traffic tools [wd3,1-] . These should mainly depend on our own forces, which request [wd2,9-]  that we should pay more attention to our education. In recent years, we have made great progress on this aspect.  With the development of modernzation [fm1,-] , some problems arise. Pollution is the most serious one among all those problems. Pollution includes air pollution and water pollution, which makes people live in a worse and worse enviorment [fm1,-] ,because of various pollution [np6,1-], people suffer from some strange diseases. [sn1,s]Now we have found some ways to solve the pollution problems, for example, the authority bans that factories let their useless water flow into  [np7, 2-3] sea or [np7,4-1]  river. Now our country's socientists [fm1,-]  have found many new methods and gradually all of them will be practised.   In a word, modernization plays a very important role in our building [np7,-2]  socialism [wd2, -1]  country. We must take the right steps to develop [cc3,-1]  modernization and make our country stronger and stronger.

Though we have learned English for almost 8 years, we find ourselves come across so many new words in our reading.  Most importantly, when we are writing, we will surprise [vp7,2-] to find that only a few words we can use frequently. Such problems are the common ones.   It seems that we have no choice but to practice more when we learn more. The problem here is that when we read we seem to be familiar with the words, but actually, we don't know what they really mean in the context, sometimes. "Look up in the dictionary," the teacher tell [vp3,2-1]  us. Is it good to us? While we write, we forget the words  [wd3,-2] correct spelling. Check in your dictionary."  All these problems result from our poor fundamental knowledge. It is necessary to read plenty of books to avoid  those embarrassments.  Books especially those concise, simplicated [fm1,-]  books benefit us of our sense of language.     Here a very easily misunderstanding [wd3,1-1]  way to learn English should be avoided. That is, to memorize the complicated, long, words on a large scale, before we have learned the common words well. It's not surprised [vp5,2-5]  that a student can't translate a simple text from English to Chinese well even though he has lots of "big" words in his mind. The most important thing we have to do is to read more and practise more.

<ST 5> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GUFSED> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC ? > TYP 2>??? Dear Sir, I feel very embarassed [fm1,-]  that I have to write this letter. However, it seems to be the only way to solve the problem resulting from our unmatching [fm1,-] living style. I regret to say that the great amount of noise coming from upstairs, where you are living, has caused much discomfort and inconvenience to my routine life. I feel sure you must be a very diligent musician for I could hear you practising clarinet at 6 ery [fm1,-] morning without fail. However, I'd like you to know that I am a free-lance writer and used to work till late in the night. I am afraid that I really need a sound sleep under a quiet enviroment [fm1,-] rather than enjoy your beautiful performance. I usually go around the city and gather materials, [sn9,-]  for writing in the afternoons. And I suppose you have a good nap during that period of time. When I come back from outside, sit down at my desk and begin to plot my story, there always seem [vp3,2-7]  to be a party going on upstairs. First there are pots, pans and kettles clashing against each other. Then there is an heated and loud conversation accompanied with the chiking [fm1,-]  of knives and forks. You and your friends seem to be very good singers for I find the Italian opera you performed is extremely well [ad2,7-] , especially the soprano part. I am sure you are great dancers too since the steps of the tap dance goes perfect with the rhythm of jazz music. If only I were participating instead of just listening. The truth is, under these circumstances not to mention those frequent screams and laughters, I can never concerntrate [fm1,-] on my work. Not until 12 o'clock, when all the sounds finally fade, could I find a peaceful time to deal with my work. But, what a pity, my mind has been so much exhausted and my brain begs for a rest. As [pp2,-1] the result, I have hardly write [vp9,3-4]  more than two paragraph [np6,1-]  during the whole week. At this rate, I am afraid I will never see the publication of my book. After all,I should be very grateful if you could do me a small favour. That is, would you mind postpone [vp5,3-3]  your practising time or do it in the park? Could you and your friend please make len [fm1,-]  noice [fm1,-]  or have the party somewhere else? Your attention and cooperation will be very much appreciated. Yours faithfully [sn9,-]  neighbour [fm3,-] . Friends I Have Had Two types of friends, the extrovert and the introvert, have played and [wd3,2-3]  exceedingly important role in my life hrough [fm1,-] the years. All of them have some influence on me and help me achieve a better understanding on life and its problems. I love t [fm1,-]  play with my extrovert friends because their open personality always seems to have a magic effect on me. They are frank. Their straightforward words [sn2,-s] . Please me rather than embarrass me for I prefer people telling me how they feel freely so that I won't feel being left out. They are vigorous. Together with them, I find numerous energetic activities to do and never get tired of them. We go picknicking [fm1,-], play tennis, visit amusment [fm1,-] park etc. Even just sitting down doesn't make us idle. We nudge, tickle each other and burst into uncontrollable laughter. Most importantly, they are the source of my gaiety. As long as they are around me, I know nothing but endless happiness.  For instance, once I did a bad job in a match [wd3,7-1]  exam and was depressed for a whole morning. One of my extrovert friends noticed and came over. He kept telling jokes and making faces and playing small tricks until the sad fog in my eyes turned into happy tears. However, my love for the extrovert friends doesn't mean I have less passion for my introvert friends, for they always give me a sense of safeness and reliability. Whenever I get into trouble, I resort to them, confide [vp2,-1] to them and have things done with the help of them. Besides being my counselors [fm1,-], they are also the best view-broaders [fm1,-] of mine since their ideas are almost always profound, comprehensive and far-reaching. Once one of them suddenly talked about the Indians' life circle theory, which not only broadened my view but also made me realized [vp5,2-]  another ysterious [fm1,-] aspect of human being. After all, both types of friends of mine also share something in common, such as generosity, kindness and consideration. I am grateful to them for their friendship, their trust and above all, the feeling of being important they grant to me. Two Schools I had entered I spent my adolescent years in two middle schools. One is No. 15 middle school, an ordinary junior middle school. Another is Guilin middle [fm3,-]  school [fm3,-] ,a key senior middle school. Both schools occupy a similar area of land [wd4,-] enroll students of almost the same number. However, the impression I have got from these two schools differs a great deal. First of all, their environments are quite different. There is an earth path leading into No.15 middle school, which is located on a dusty field bared of trees. Opposite to the school is chemical factory. Thick yellow ill-smelled smoke often carried into classrooms by wind. What impressed me most is a deep green pond covered with duckweeds and garbage. It is said once there was a child drowned in it. however [fm3,-] , Guilin middle [fm3,-]  school [fm3,-]  is a pleasant-looking school located in the center of downtown. It is accessible by a broad road lined with tall trees and wall newspaper [np6,1-3]  on both sides. The teaching buildings are farther inside, away from the noise of traffic. There is also a pond, but smaller and decorated with rockery [wd3,-s]  and fountain. Secondly, Their constructions are also in a great contrast. In No.15 iddle [fm3,-]  school [fm3,-] , the teaching buildings and the teacher' [sn9,1-1] s domitories are only divided by a narrow path. Both constructions look shabby and need rennovation. Laborotries [fm1,-]  are mixed among classrooms, all equiped with old desks carved with indistinguishable pictures and obscene words and tottering chairs. On the contrary, The [fm3,-]  teaching area and living area in Guilin middle [fm3,-]  school [fm3,-]  are clearly cut by a boader [fm1,-] of wall. It has an independent five- storey lab building and an auditorium. Most of the desks and chairs are new and the broken one [np6,2-2]  are mended at the beginning of each term. During the three years when I studied there, I often saw that some of the buildings were under rennovation. Thirdly, the looks of teachers and students and their relationship in these two schools are absolutely not the same. In No.15 middle school, the teachers always look stern and arroyed. [fm1,-]  The students are mischievious [fm1,-] and hate study. The teachers always try to discipline the students with strict rules and the students always try to escape from them. The atmosphere in classrooms is passive and rigid and stiff. On the other hand, he relationship between teachers and students can almost be alled [fm1,-] friendly. The teaches always encourage the students to teach themselves and most of the students are willing to learn. Therefore, an academic atmosphere is developed. Having been able to study in these two vastly different schools, I realize how important a school [sn9,-]  its enviroment [fm1,-] , facilities and atmosphere, it [wd7,-s]  to a student's well-being. CECL (Communicative English for Chinese Learners) is the chief course for the first and second year English majors in Guang zhou University of Foreign Languages. CECL is composed of many independent units, each dealing of [pp1,1-3]  a practical topic, such as "Festivals and Celebrations", "Enviroment [fm1,-] " "Education' etc. The following is a typical example of how a CECL unit is taught. We usually start with a warming-up exercise which could be a few questions concerning daily life or personal experience, a few blacks [wd3,2-3]  to fill in, or a brief discussion. Then, we are required to read a couple of written materials and to enhance our comprehension by answering questions and doing multiple choices. Afterwards, the teacher will ask us to put on our earphones and play us some tape-recording. We need to do some exercises while listening to see how well we could comprehend and how much we could remember. In CECL textbook, there is a special activity called " interaction". The textbook provides a certain "setting" for the students to "act". Usually four or five students form a group and each one will play a part. All groups perform the same mini-play at the same time, according to the instructions given both by the text-book and by the teacher. After that, the teacher may choose one group to perform before the class. At the end of each unit, we are required to hand in a piece of writing on a certain topic. The above said is usual practice of learning a CECL unit. Femininity Nowadays men often accuse women of lacking in femininity? What do they mean by femininity? Most probably, men tend to concern femininity with long hair, graceful dress [sn9,-]timid expression and coy behaviour. So no wonder the image of contemporary women not only disappoint them but seares [fm1,-] them to half death. Now there is not much difference in the appearance of men and women. Many women cut their hair short, wear men's shirts and trousers, and even smoke or drink heavily. However, what men hate most is the way today's women act. Ever since WWII, women have achieves [vp9,2-2]  great success through the Liberation Movement. They have taken up many important posts which used to be occupied by men only. They have made distinguished accomplishment in many fields which used to be only the men's dominion. They can acquire as much knowledge as men do. And sometimes they act even bolder [wd2,3-]  than men. These changes give men a feeling of insecurity and being deprived of hat they ought to have. Nevertheless, as far as I am concerned, the traditional oncept of femininity must be changed as time goes by. For women, there is more than being a good wife and mother. They need a areer [fm1,-] and an independent life of their own. Sometimes they have to be tough in order to win in competitions. But surely they are not encouraged to go to extremely [wd2,2-] . They are still women. Their femininity remains. What have to be rejected on them [sn2,-s] . Gentle but not weak, capable but not dominating, lovely but not flirtatious, strong but not overwhelming---- that is what a contemporary woman is expect  [vp9,7-2]  to be. When I worked as a temporary interpreter in the 14th China's Export Commodity Fair, a lot of interesting things happened around me through communicating with buyers coming from all over the world. One night, at about 12 o'clock, when we were ready to close the exhibition on the ground floor in Dong Fang Hotel, a foreigner walked in. "Hello," he said with a big smile, " I'd like to have a look at your items. I wish I were not too late." We told him that it was not late at all and assured [vp1,-4]  him out best ervice. [fm1,-] This Cyprian was in his middle fourties [fm1,-] . But he acted like a boy. He got [wd4,2-3]  with our boss immediately, despite the language barrier. After inquiring the prices for hundreds of items, he said he was hungry. So we made several bowls of instant noodles and ate together with him. The inquiries and quotations went on and on. t 3 o'clock, our boss was very tired. He went to [wd5,1-1]  upstairs to rest and left the Cyprian to his son. Certainly the Cyprian was not satisfied. Next morning, the Cyprian reappeared. The first thing he did was to get the boss. Then he asked me to interprete [fm1,-] every word he said to the boss. " This man who are supposed to be my friend,' he said intoningly [fm1,-], seizing the boss's arms, " left me to my own devices last night. I am very angry. Tell him that." Everybody knew that he was joking. But we still said some comforting words. In a second, he was cheerful again. "I'm going to the fair now. I'll be here tonight. And you [sn9,-] " he patted the boss's should [fm1,-] , " you must be right here waiting for me." Then he turned to us. " see [fm3,-]  you at 12 o'clock sharp." He threw that at us happily and walked away. I made a face behind him and said to the boss, "you [fm3,-] 'd better get some sleep now, boss." The boss nodded speechlessly, not knowing whether to laugh or to cry.

I'm a new comer of this apartment, just your downstairs. [sn8,s]At that time, I felt uncomfortable for the frequent noise when you moved he funitures [np5,0-]  and even, when you scolded your child in a high oice [fm1,-] etc. Once, I was suddenly woken up at noon by a large " Peng, peng." It turned out that you were then nailing your new frame on the wall.I even talked about the matter to Mrs Brown. To my surprise, the noice [fm1,-] was not only controlled a little but increased. Last night, the situation is really annoying. Of course, I have no right to prevent you from having a party with your friends for weeken [fm1,-]. So we kept silent during the night inspit [fm2,-]  of the cry, the music and the tapping on the floor only with the hope that maybe the noise would end soon. But the recorder continued to midnight. And you seemed not to stop dance [vp5,1-] till this morning. The sound made us tired and have no peace of mind at all. It's really too much. Again, I don't mean to disturb your life. But you know this building is insulated. So please think of your neighbours, think of us and make noise as light [wd2,-s] as possible. Thank you for your kindness. Your neighbour, Mrs. Qiu. Friends I Have Had [sn9,-] The words active and quiet can be used to group the friends I have had. Since I began to make friends at a young age. I have found that my friends act either actively, attending various ctivities [fm1,-] , or quietly, preferring to sitting down and talking rather than going out for a dance. I have more quiet friends in [wd4,-s]  Primary [fm3,-]  school, in [wd5,-s]  high school and even now in the college. I am not the girl who is very talkative or interested in seeking the limelight. That is why whenever I am in a new envronment [fm1,-] , I can easily become good friends with some quiet girls. These girls appear gentle and quiet, seeming to shut themselves in. But now and then, we'd like to sit side by side, talking about the study and daily life, exchanging viewpoints and encouraging each other. But that doesn't prevent me from making friends with the active guys. They are capable of enlivening the atmosphere. Being with them, I always have a happy mood even though I am frustrated just a little while before, [sn9,-]  of course, we seldom tough  [fm1,-]  the serious topic but chat in a loud voice in the gathering or go out till late into the night. Besides, I do not necessarily [wd4,-s]  much attention to my behaviour or the choice of my words. They do not bother about small matters. I learn a lot from my these friends with opposite characters. Getting on well with the active friends make [vp3, 7-5]  me come[wd5,-2] to be frank, generous and tolerant while eing [fm1,-] with the quiet ones, I learn to think more by myself and learn to look at the events around me in a calm way. Two Schools Our institute enjoys a comparatively more tranquil ampus [fm1,-] on the Sundays than Guang zhou Institute of Chinese Medicine. I have been to that institute twice on Sunday and every time I noticed that the campus was still full of people, which is not the case here on weekens [fm1,-] . Some students were sitting on the stonedesks [fm2,-]  by the campus path, studying or chatting in groups in a low voice nearby and some leisurely walking with their visiting friends [sn9,-]  some old feelows [fm1,-]  were doing Tai ji [fm2,-]  exercises. [sn1,s]But here, weeken [fm1,-]  is a time for us to go out doing shopping or visiting friends. So walking around the campus or [fm1,-]  Sundays morning, you seldom see students near you. And the stone desks along the so-called River of love [fm3,-]  sickness [fm3,-] " [sn9,-]  are empty despite the fact that these desks are occupied on week days [fm2,-]  by lovers in the evening or by students reading aloud on [wd3,-1] daytime. When it was time for lunch, I found the dining room in Guang zhou [fm2,-]  Institute of Chinese Medicine is very crowded, while here, the chefs in the dining room enjoy free time, not [,0-5]  so many students visiting here. Instead, you may happen to meet some students from the market with vegetables and meet [fm1,-]  on hand. They prefer to cook [wd4,-s]  themselves at this time. CECL is a teaching material designed and edited by experts and professions [wd3,-s]  by [wd5,0-4]  the experts and professions of GUFL and used exclusively by the English major [np6,2-2]  of GUFL. It is the abbreviation of Communicative English for Chinese Learners, whose aim is to provide [vp1,-5]  us the foundamental [fm1,-]  communicative skills. The CECL books include many units, each concerning itself with one certain type of specific topic such as Environment [fm3,-] . [sn9,-]  Chinese Food [fm3,-]  and sports [sn9,-]  etc. The whole set of 8 CECL books cover almost all the aspects we may come across in the society, and we are required to finish the course within the first two years. That is to say, we learn one book for half a term.Before every unit, we get a word list containing some new words and the important phrases and expressions appearing in the unit, which we are asked to look up in the dictionary and to be familiar with in advance. Usually, we are recommended not to prepare for the text. In class, we are not confined to one activity like grammar, listening or writing, but none of them are ruled out. We may begin with listening [wd4,-s]  a tap [wd3,-s]  and answering the questions, and then we step into the grammer [fm1,-] or the interplaying role on some as realistic question as what [,0-10]  is the preset [wd3,3-4]  situation of Chinese sports about. This discussion between every two or four students is always the most attractive for the participants. The teacher encourages us to speak out freely. It doesn't matter whither [fm1,-]  your opinion is right or not with the presupposition that you can make your argument consistent. Sometimes the teacher would like to divide the class into a [wd5,3-1]  groups to have an interesting debate. Reviewing is very essential for CECL. Besides the words and phrases, we are also encouraged to read some beautiful paragraphs, and if possible, to recite them. As to the exam for CECL, we have questions as various as dictionary [wd3,-s]  of a short paragraph, listening, writing. [sn9,-]  Translating [fm3,-]  and comprehensive reading, which are finished within about 3 hours. In general, CECL is a comprehensive course. Friend As for the terms [wd3,-s]  of friend, the dictionary has many definitions, one of which is that A [fm3,-]  friend is a person who shares the same feeling of natural liking and understanding, the same interest, etc. Yes, the girl sitting beside me is my friend because we are both crazy about Big Beat, sharing the common sense [wd3,3-5]  on Hei Bao Tang Dynasty [sn9,-]  etc. On the other hand, we have long been familiar with the old saying, [sn9,-]  a friend indeed is a friend in need. This sounds indisputable. I knew a true story. A pair of lovers, while crossing a forest in their trip, come [vp6,-s]  across a bear. They didn't think of themselves but struggled together with the bear. Though they were badly hurt, they were all alive, [sn9,-]  they are real friends. For me, the term friend always reminds me of my dairy book. Definitely, I look at it as my friend, a can-not-speaking [fm2, -]  friend. Whenever I meet with sorrow or frustration or the alike [wd3,9-] , the thought of it will inevitably come upon my mind. The result is that I get relieved. Thus, I come to the conclusion that a friend is actually a companion, which would be with you in need. A hundred [wd3,-s]  who just quarrelled with his wife at home called the young man next to him in a bar a friend because he knew the young man failed in getting an attractive girl as his girl-friend and they shared their experience. Equally, a hunter can cherish his faithful hound as his best friend because it accompanied him all long [wd5,1-1]  time, not only pursuing the hare and pheasant, but "hearing" him and communicating with him. The winter vocation [wd4,-s]  nearly over [sn2,-s] , en [fm3,-] I leant [fm1,-]  that students can enjoyed the 50 flying fee. I hurried to call my old classmate in Inquiring Office of the CSAC for one student ticket. As it was almost beyond the allocated time, she then asked me to give her my student cards [np6,5-]  as quickly as possible. The next day when I rode to her office, she had been off duty. So I asked her fellow to pass on the card to her. Two days later, I phoned her again for the result. As soon as knowing who I was, she burst out: " Qui, I am really very sorry. Your student card has been lost." Her calm voice plunged into eager one. She said that the day before, her fellow had given the card to her, when she was asked to the waiting room. And when she came back, she found the card in the counter disappear [vp3,1-]. " I'm so shameful for that." Her self-blame [fm2,-]  voice came from the other side. " I had JUST [fm3,-]  put it on the counter and it was not there." she added. " That doesn't matter," I had to comfort her. "In that case, would you buy me an ordinary ticket?" "Not [wd3,-s] ," she interpreted  [wd3,-s]  me, " listen to me, Qiu. Here are [vp3, -s]  one ticket. It will be OK if you pay yuan [wd1,-]168 for it." " Not [wd3,-s] , [sn9,-]  it's unfair..." I understood her meaning. " Not [wd3,-s] , [sn9,-]  don't say it again, [sn9,-] if you regard me as your friend, would you be so kindly be let me make up a little of [pp1,4-2]  my fault[sn8,s-]?" Though I expained [fm1,-]  that she didn't mean to lose the card and it's too much for her to do so, she just insisted on her apology and the half payment of the ticket. At last, I gave up. This, to some degree, is an embarrassing experience for me. 

<ST 5> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GUFSED> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC ? > <TYP 2>??? Mr. ~~, I'm the man living downstairs, [sn9,-]  it seems that my last complaining letter didn't work at least a little! The noice [fm1,-]  you make has not only continued, but increased! I have to admit that seldom people can make noise for 24 hours long every day like you. I wonder if you are a super man! How can you do it so successfully? In the whole day, you've kept the recorder on in the top volum [fm1,-] . The sounds of the music seems [vp3,5-5]  like [wd5, 5-4]  to shake the wall and all furniture in any apartment. I can even feel my feet shaking, as well as my body, my heart. I can't bear it! And you think yourself Mechael [fm1,-] Jackson? No! You know you are yelling like a buffalo, do you? On the other hand, you always throw dust down which is usually blown into my apartment. Now I have to shut the bedroom windows the whole day, in order to keep my bed clean. But [wd3,-s]  doing that, I've lost chances of getting the fresh air outside [wd3,-s] . The most ashamed [aj5,2-3]  thing you do is the terrible noice [fm1,-]  you give out at night. Please don't when making love in order to show me that you're a superman! I knew that at the very beginning. I can quite enough [cc5,3-3]  resist the tempertation [fm1,-]  how [wd7,-s] , but I can't stand the continuous clash of your bed and your sudden scream which have [vp3,4-5]  stopped me from falling asleep. Well, that's all. I hope you can give me at least one week's peace time for [pp1, 8-5]  me to finish  my graduation-essay [fm2,-] , if you don't want to be in trouble. The man downstairs. HOW CECL IS TAUGHT CECL ( Communicative English for Chinese Learners) is a main English course used in several foreign anguages [fm1,-] schools such as GUFL. If you're a starter, here I can give you a brief introduction how it's taught. First, we should know that CECL is taught unit by unit. It covers a wide range including FOOD AND DRINK, TOURISM, HISTORY, ENTERTAINMENT and RELIGION, etc. We cannot think that we learn it in depth, the same as the teaching. After preparing for it ahead of time, you study the unit. In the 2 hours, reading is usually done above all because it can help you understand the unit better so that you can come to discuss it and grasp what the book tends to teach you. Following the teaching, there are always some [fm1,-] uestions concerning with the context for you to answer. Usually they're multiple choices or true or false choices. In order to help you understand the unit better, the teacher always offers the students some topics to discuss. Through the practice, both then [fm1,-]  oral English and their understanding about [pp1,2-2]  the unit will be improved. Next are some listening practices. You listen to the tape and write down the exact words in your text-book so that you can learn to use the useful words or phrases that are new to you. Some party [wd3,-s] of the tape were recorded by the foreign experts. You'll again have chance to imitate the pure English or American pronunciation. Diction [wd3,-s]  is often added by the teacher so that your listening and your spelling of the new worlds [wd3,5-4]  can make much progress. At last, writing is headed. But it's seldom done in class. The teacher often demands you to do it after class and hand it in later. Generally, CECL lays stress on the four skills: listening, speaking, reading, and writing.  Cities I Have Visited. The cities I have visited can be divided into three kinds: industial [fm1,-] cities, tourist cities and evoloping [fm1,-] cities. First, the industrial cities I have been to, such as Beijing and Guangzhou are famous for their advanced economy and the advanced [fm1,-] iving standard of the people. The income of these cities mainly comes from their industrial products. In Beijing and Guangzhou, you can find markets everywhere. In the markets, almost all things connecting to the life car [wd3,-s]  be seen and bought. Once you have money, you can easily buy the thing you need. However the prices of something would be higher than those in other cities. Also the industrial cities are usually well organized, especially for Beijing. The streets and roads in Beijng [fm1,-] are so broard [fm1,-], smooth and clean that you'll feel very comfortable while walking, riding bicycles, or driving cars on them. Second, the tourist [fm1,-] ities including Guilin and Xi'an are famous for their beautiful cenes [fm1,-] and historical spots. In Xi'an, the 
teracota [fm1,-] is very famous and has attracted many travellers all over the world. Guilin's waters and mountain also help the city to make a lot of money. That's to say, the income of the tourist cites depends on tourism. Most of the cities I've even [fm1,-]  visited are developing cities, such as Jiangmen and Huizhou. They can hardly give you any impression because they themselves have few features. Anyway, they're devoloping [fm1,-] so fast that we couldn't look down upon them. Huizhou, the little city in Guang dong [fm2,-] , now has attracted many foreign funds capital funded enterprices. [sn8,s] All these are the cities [wd4,-s]  have visited in China. I hope that some day I can have chances to visit cities in the west [fm3,-] .  I've been to Zhong shan [fm2,-]  University for several times. When I contrasted it with GUFL, which I'm now studying at, it showed a great difference. At[pp2,-1] all, zhong [fm3,-]  shan [fm2,-]  Univerdity gave you a more comfortable feeling than GUFL did. In order to identify it completely we can try to make contrast about their fame, area, environment, teaching facilities and entertaining facilities. No doubt, Zhong shan [fm2,-]  University enjoys much greater fame than GUFL does. It's one of the most famous universities in south China, even a foreign [wd2,1-2]  knows it and shows great interest when mentioning it. I'm sure that GUFL couldn't be so attractive . some [fm3,-]  people in Guang zhou [fm2,-]  haven't heard of the name of GUFL before and some know, but they don't know where to find it. On the contrary, you can easily find Zhong shan [fm2,-] University in Xingang Road. In [wd4,-s]  area, GUFL is apparently much smaller than ZU. We don't have to know the exact number. You can just traveral [fm1,-]  around the two niversities [fm1,-] and contrast the time you use. Definitely it costs [cc3,-5]  you much time to traveral [fm1,-]  the whole ZU, while [wd4,-5]  GUFL, quite a little time. We can find that half of the area in GUFL is covered by teachers' buildings. That's quite different from the situation of ZU. With the help of Baiyun Hill, GUFL provides a beautiful scene to s --- trees and flowers are seen all around. But that's pure natural scene, not live[wd7,-] the scenes at ZU, such as the man-made lakes, which are very beautiful and clean. ZU does better in the pretection [fm1,-]  of environment. The roads in ZU are usually kept tidy, while we can often see dust on the roads in GUFL. definitely [fm3,-]  it needs improvement on the hand [wd7,2-] . The main reason why ZU can enjoy a good fame comes from its perfect teaching and entertaining facilities. Its library is the largest of all university libraries in Guangdong. Ying dong [fm2,-]  studuim [fm1,-] [fm3,-]  , which was built with Mr. Huo Ying dong [fm2, -] 's funds is also the most attractive and practical one in Guangdong. When turning back to GUFL's poor library and its football field, which is overed by high grass, we have to shake our heads with pity! We annot [fm1,-] even find a good playground here in GUFL to hold a sportsmeet! In general, ZU provides a more comfortable situation to its studens [fm1,-], and GUFL, still needs many improvements. A Friend is a person who shares the same feelings of natural liking and understanding, the same interests, etc. It can be divided into two: close friends and common friends. A close riend [fm1,-] can share many thoughts with you, even his/her ecrets [fm1,-]. In addition, they have the same or similar feeling on sth [fm1,-]. When your friend was sad or uncomfortable, you had no reason to be happy man. You should feel sad or uncomfortable too and more or ss [fm1,-], release your friend's sadness. But that's impossible for a common friend to do--- they even don't know when you're sad and hen you're happy. They just past [wd2,2-2]  their greetings while meeting with you. That's quite different from what a close friend shows. In addition, you see a friend more regularly or often than some one [fm2,-]  else, so that you have more time to exchange your feelings and you [pr4,5-3]  points of view, especially when you are close friends. so [fm3,-]  people we also can meet regularly or quite often, but they might not be our friends. [sn8,s]For example, we meet some of our teachers almost everyday, but not all of them can be our friends. Sometimes we even hate them. In this case we meet to have classes, not for the purpose of making friends. "A friend in need is a friend indeed." Those who cannot help you solve your problems aren't called " A FRIEND." A real friend will try his best to help you --- this kind of help is based on faithfulness, not on money or some other benefits. Generally, a friend will always support you and fight with the difficulties and your opponents together with you. But if necessary, he will fairly point out your mistakes to help you improve and make more progress. A real good friend can share bed with you without fearing that you will kill or hurt him at the [wd5,3-1]  midnight. One day I chatted with my close friend Denise in the institute. We sat side by side on a bench. Suddenly, she cried in joy " Look! Cat!" Then a loudly [fm1,-]  yellow cat with brown stripes on its body was seem [wd3,-s]  jumping down from the roof of a store beside us. " How fat and lovely it is!" Denise said, with her eyes twinkling. " Yes," I was surprised " Do you like cats too?" I thought that normally girls would like dogs better than cats. " Certainly, I loved them when I was still a little girl. We even fed a cat which resembles [vp6,-s]  that cat in appearance at that time, so that [wd5,s-]  it recalled [wd3,-s]  me of my cat when I saw that cat just now." She became more and more excited. " I know. But you haven't concerned [wd3,-s]  about your cat before. How is it now?" She turned her face and said in sadness: " She has been dead." " I'm sorry ... Because of illness?" I asked. " Maybe, [sn9,-]  She didn't eat anything although I fed her with much delicious food. And we had to see her growing thiner [fm1,-] and thiner [fm1,-]. Later, she got dead." Denise said in a nearly trembly [wd2,3-1]  voice. I know the mood that she was in. " So that you even didn't knew [vp9,3-]  hat she died of, right?" Denise slightly nodded her head. " She has gone." I noticed that she was staring at the cat which had the similar appearance of hers, and now ran away. No doubt, she was referring to it. " It's a pity that we don't wave [wd3,-s]  veterinnarians [fm1,-]  here." I continued." Yes. And I wish I were, but. .." she stopped and sighed. " Life is life. There is something we cannot espect [fm1,-] ," I was trying to comfort her." I asked [wd3,-s]  to feed 4 cats altogether [wd3,-s] . I loved them more and more, and, spent most of my spare time playing with them.But they were lost or killed by others. I hate the people who treat my cats so cruel [wd2,6-] ! You seem to be comparatively lucky, right?" " Yes," Denise sighed again and said. " Why can't the animals be treated as equally as us human-beings?" " Ha ha." I laughed, " That seems not possible yet. But let's wish that some day in the future it will come true. Well, I have something to do now. See you next time." " See you". Then we left. Describing A Person: When the sun was shining in the middle of the sky [sn2,-s] . Gary looper [fm3,-] , an American cop, appeared on the street again. Under the yellowish setting of the late nineteen [np9,2-1]  century constructions, his black uniform was very eye-catching. The shing [fm1,-]  silver medal was hung on the left of his waiste-coat [fm1,-], indicating his identity. Now and then he put his right hand upon the pistol tied on the belt. The gun was so heavy together with big hand that the belt sloped to the right a little. But at the moment he seemed totally unaware of the weight on his waist, heading to the police office. Under the smart velvet hat was his clear- cut feature: keen eyes, dark eye brows, straight nose and the firm and dignified jaw. His age was not a secret, for everal [fm1,-] white hair behind his ears and the wrinkles at the corner of his eyes revealed it. he looked serious. His eyebrow frowned and his mouth tightly shut. He had a well-built figure and a straight back, from which one could conclude he had used to be a handsome young man and popular among the community. Even though today his youth had faded with years, his popularity remained, not because of his apperance but because of his trust-worthiness. His pace was always steady and his hands mere [fm1,-]  always powerfully moving with rythmn [fm1,-] while he walked. His typical walking style had been so will-known [fm1,-]  that whenever the residents spoted [fm2,-]  a man with long leg walking in this way, even 50 feet away, they could assume that: [sn9,-]  Gary Cooper was coming. Nov. 8th. An early morning, a father with his two little girls has arrived at the gate of the hospital, waiting to visit his wife who has just given birth to a boy. It is still early; the locked iron with wire screen looks like a stern guard, resolved o separate the hospital and the outside world. A scarlet number 27 is printed on the wall, contrasting the grey pavement. In the chill [wd2,2-1]  breeze, the thickly-dressed family are all looking inside the hospital earnestly. A lovely girl, about two years old, is sitting on his father's shoulders. Her chabby [fm1,-] face is resting comfortably on her father's head. Her little hands are dragging the collar of her father's flannel overcoat. The father, like his little girls, looks wistful, firmly holding the girls little leg, with his sinecry big hands. Another little irl [fm1,-] is in red otted [fm1,-] blouse and short- skirt. Her hair looks like a mess of cabbage. Her hands are grasping the cold iron bar; it seems as if she wanted to squeeze her little head through the gate. Prossibly [fm1,-]  lack of the mother's care, they all look casually dressed, especially ten [wd7,-s]  father--- his mudelled [fm1,-] hair, his flare trousers creased, his shoes dusty. Describing What People Do I am one of those who are never able to sleep like a log, so I can tell exactly at what time the lights are turned on every morning. The biological clock in my body works so well that by the time the lights are on, that is at six o'clock, I have been turning over on the bed, fully aware the light will be on at any time in the next fifteen minutes. When jthe [fm1,-]  light turns on, I first try to hide in the shadow of the musquito-net [fm1,-], shunning the sudden bright light. But soon I find the white light just keeps peneatrating [fm1,-] my eye-lids; I suddenly opened my eyes, face the luminous ray, deeply inhaled the cool air and rise up. Putting aside the warm quilt, I get out of the bed [wd4,-s]  begin to put an [fm1,-]  the clothes on the chair, which I have usually prepared the last [wd3,-s]  night. At about 6:20, dressed, I take cup, tooth-brush, ooth-paste [fm1,-], towel and basin to the washing-room. Usually at this moment most girls are still struggling on their beds to get up, so I am always the first one to get there. The process usually begins with the meticulous teeth-brushing [fm1,-], because having suffered from some teeth disease, I am very conscious of teeth hygiene. Ten minutes later, going back to any room, I take out some necessary instruments and sterilizing liquid to wash my content-lens [fm1,-] . This requires even more meticulation [fm1,-]. I first remove the lid from the sterilized bottle, take out the fragile lenses and put them on my left palm. Then pour several drops of sterilizing liquid on them and use my right forefinger to gently rub the lenses. When they are dried up, I carefully put them into my eyes, as if I was holding a precious diamond on my finger-tips. During this time, my breakfast, a cup of yogurt sent [vp7,4-3]  onto my table; the loud speaker [fm2,-]  outside is broadcasting the news on central [fm3,-]  People's Broadcasting station [fm3,-] . At 6:45, I quickly comb my hair, pick up the necessary materials for the corses [fm1,-]  on that day and go out for morning reading at 7 o'clock. The above is just what I usually do in the morning of Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. For the nest [fm1,-] weekdays when morning exercises is required, that is another story. 

<ST 5> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GDUFS> <AGE ?> <WAY ?> <DIC ?> <TYP 2> ??? 22nd Feb. 1993 Dear Ruth, You just cannot imagine where I went to spend my Chinese New Year. A hydroelectric plant site--- a thousand miles away from my home. my [fm3,-]  father was too busy at work to come back to reunite with us. He should feel lonely at that happy hour without us. So we went. ( You see, it is quite fantastic for we [pr4,-s]  having [vp5,6-6]  the festival in a remote strange valley instead of our own home). There we had no store and no cooking utilizers [wd3,1-]  so we ate in the dining room. Furthermore, there was no enough room so my sister  and I had to sleep in the hotel. But regardless [wd4,-3]  all these uncomforts [fm2,-]  we were together again. It was really an emotional shock when I saw my dearest father at the first sight. How thin he was! He had to work ten hours a day. each [fm3,-]  day his return from work was my happiest moment. At night we went to dancing ball or watched TV together, chatting. At [pp1,-6]  the Eve of the Spring Festival,we had a big dinner and waited excitedly for the ring of the New Years bell. That memory will last forever. And how about your experience of the festival? I'd like to hear from you soon. Yours, Emma Huang. Class2, Grade2, English Department, Guangzhou Institute of Foreign Languages Guang zhou, 510421 P. R. China 8th, March 1993.   The Personnel Manager, Kent Travel association, Beare house, Sims Road, London, ZL90.9ST U. K. Dear Sir, In replying to your advertisement in the China Daily of 1st March 1993. I should like to apply for a guiding post in your centre in my town. I am now a sophomore in Guang zhou [fm2,-]  Institute of Foreign Languages. I major in Communictive [fm1,-] English and Oral English [sn9,-]  I am interested in meeting people, especially those come from different culture [np6,4-] , and will be very pleased to be able to show them our places of interest [sn9,-] I once guided my friend around my town, which I feel, would be very helpful if I could get a post in your association.

A Campaign Should Be launched [fm3,-]  Against Smoking The term of smoking's [np4,-] death is coming [wd7,-s] . Because people have [vp6,-s]  being realized, [sn9,-] what disadvantages they will be placed if they continue to let smoking go it' [np4,3-2] s own way. The first disadvantage, everyone knows, is the destruction smoking brings to our health. Though nowadays technology has been developed to make smoking more harmless, but what people can do is only to reduce the harm, not kill it [, -s] [cc3,4-1]  . the [fm3,-]  second drawback is the financial problem. Smoking wastes so much money that it tends to become a main cause of family fighting. Sometimes people divorce just because they cannot stand their spauses [fm1,-] ' smoking. The last shortcoming, but not the least mportant [fm1,-] one, is that we are used by some evil [cc6,-]capital [wd2,2-1]countries. Such as   American [wd2,-s] [sn4,-s], it has realized the disadvangtage [fm1,-] of smoking itself, and in it's [pr4,1-2] own country smoking is not popular anymore. So it turns it's [pr4,-1]  market from America to Asia, especially to china [fm3,-] . Haven't you noticed that the ads for " Marboroll [fm1,-]" [fm1,-]has become a familiar sights [np6,2-]  all over our country? [wd4,-2]  United States just want to make money, [sn9,-]  they wouldn't care about our health and our lives. I don't [wd4,-s]  we are stupid enough to spend money on smoking in return for poor health. We don't want to represent [cc3,4-6]  the history of 150 years ago, do we? So in short, for the sake of our own health, our nation's prosperity and our nation's self- respect, a campaign should be launched against smoking. Hearing an explosion, I looked up, finding a rock was bounding toward me. I made a leap while the men were shouting and gesticulating at me. Although the boulder changed direction slightly during the bumping, it still coming [vp4,2-3]  straightly for me. I must [vp6,-s]  find a cover [wd3,-s]  otherwise I couldn't survive. I glanced and noticed an opening between two rocks so I wedged in quickly, and just a few feet away the rock struck the ground and rested. Below are things you are to do on the first day. You will assemble at the school hall at 9 am. Then 15 minutes later you are to report to your class teacher for timetable. At 9:30 you will have a general knowledge test in the library. The Medical [fm3,-]  inspection will begin at 11:00 you can have milk and biscuits in the school hall as a break. From 11:25 to 12:45 you are to work according to your normal timetable. At 12:45, you will have your lunch in the school dining room or in the annexe [fm1,-]. The normal timetable for afternoon is from 2.pm to 4.pm. Then you will be dismissed. There are two additional requirements: first, you must wear your uniform at all time, [sn9,-] second, you will not talk in the corridor or smoke or eat in class. You can play football or asketball [fm1,-] on Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons. From the notice board in the hall you will see information about school clubs and activities. My dear ladies and gentlemen, I am your downstairs neighbour. I know you newly moved here from the countryside. Life there must be very free and relax [wd2,7-] , because I hear you keep complaining about life here day and night. But, are you aware of that this very complaint makes life even more difficult? Especially for your neighbours? I am working in P&G company [fm3,-], which is on the other side of the town. So I have to travel a lot before I get home every evening. But no matter how late I come back, I can hear the thundering music of your party. Your laughter, your dance and your song would be great pleasures to me if they were in the spring [fm3,-]  festival [fm3,-]. But not [wd5,-s]  to a person tired of long-time work and deadly [wd3,-5]  wants a sound sleep, they are really, excuse me, sufferings. Last night I came back at 9 o'clock. After I had my simple dinner, I sitted [fm2,-]  down to read TIMES. But Michael Jackson's DANGEROUS repeated again and again. At 11 o'clock when I went to bed, it ended, [sn9,-]  I was very glad. But five minutes latter [wd3,3-] , Whitney's I will [fm3,-]  Always love [fm3,-]  You pervaded the whole building. I love this song very much, but you don't know how terrible it sounded last night. I didn't know how and when I went to sleep at last. but [fm3,-]  today, I made quite a lot of mistakes in my work because of sleepy mind. You know I'm always awken [fm1,-] [vp7,3-]   every morning at 6 o'clock by you [pr4,1-2]  wooden slippers? I hear them [pr4,2- 4]  "Ca ta, Ca ta" from the bedroom to the washroom, then wait [vp1,-3]  them [pr4,1-3]  "Ca ta" back, I think I can sleep then .but [fm3,-]  another "Ca ta, ca ta" begins. I don't mean you shouldn't get up so early but, could you possibly put on another pairs [np6,1-3]  of cloth slippers ? I don't know what you'll do at day time, but I doubt that sleeping so late and getting up so early, how could you be energetic? Maybe you'll have snap at noon. But I haven't because of the busy work, actually I have to work 10 hours a day. So in the morning, even five minutes longer sleep is precious to me. I hope we all can get life easlier [fm1,-] . This letter is only a reminder. Yours sincerely [sn9,-] H. H. X. Friends I have had Friends, children or adult [np6,3-] , are equally important in my life. I happens [vp3,1-6]  to have a little boy friend called Bird, a sensitive four -your-old. From him I learn a lot. He told me a dragonfly had six legs, and never hid yourself because it's validless [fm1,-]. He is a genius( children are all geniuses [sn9,-]  they only degenerate to common people after they are fifteen, like us[sn1,s]) with his sensibity [fm1,-]. He notices grass grow higher,  moon becomes fuller, and tells me that, no, teaches me that. The same helpful are adult friends. besides [fm3,-]  boys and girls of my own age, I even have two friends [,-s]  nearly fifty years old, a sweet couple. With youth I exchange information, idea [np6,5-]  and love. We study together, play together, grow together, make mistakes together, laugh together and sing together. I can never imagine a world without them. But elder people can teach me a lot, as well as children. although they teach me different things in a different way. The sweet couple's optimism to life inspires my self- confidence. But they also tell me, " life [fm3,-]  has no meaning originally, [sn9,-]  it is only an accident." So I know I should never care too much about myself, thus I lead a [np7,-1]  easier and happier life than before. These are the friends I have in my life. I love them and respect them. They are indispensable in my life. One Sunday I went to Guang zhou [fm2,-]  Library to meet a friend. We had arranged to meet at the gate at 11 o'clock. But by a quarter past eleven I still did not find him. no [fm3,-]  sooner than [cj2,-s]  I decided to go I noticed many people gathered there between two flower urseries [fm1,-]. I approached them and was pleased to find they were alking [fm1,-] in English. I joined a group of three and talked with them about American accents for several minutes. It was not interesting so I turned to another side. A young man noticed me and smiled tome [fm2,-] . I smiled back. Then he smiled again. I was greatly pleased and thought he must be a little shy. So I said " it [fm3,-] 's always difficult to open a conversation." He said " Yes, [sn9,-]  Are you a student?" I nodded. But actually I didn't like people to know that I was a student becaused [fm1,-] I felt ashamed. Students, in my mind, tended to be foolish and frirolous [fm1,-]. He told me he went out of university just one year before and so was still amiliar [fm1,-] and interested in campus life. Then he described how he went out to find some part time tutor work when he was a sophomore and then set up a tutor work center and entitled hemself [fm1,-]  " head". I found him very talktive, [sn9,-]  in fact, he was talking all the time. And he smiled a lot because he like smile, not because he was shy. Time went on, I looked at my watch, it was 12 o'clock now, I looked around, still couldn't find my friend. So I said, " It's 12 o'clock now.". He didn't respond. So I went on " Are you hungry?" He said yes, then I continued " me [fm3,-] , too.". He was going to laugh: " What do you mean?" I smiled. Then he said, " o.k [fm3,-] . Let's go together." We went away side by side, both smiling. After a while he asked me, " Now we are out of the English corner, which do you prefer, Mandarian [fm1,-] or Cantonese?" I said: " Mandarian [fm1,-]." We went to a restaurant and had a cheerfuler [aj3,1-]  and freer talk because it was easiler [fm1,-]  to speak in Chinese. He gave me his BB number and said I could call him whenever I wanted to have a talking partner. I said all right. Then we shaked [fm2,-]  hands: " Good-bye." Another day......[sn9,s] Shortly before Kenya gained independence [sn2,-s] . In a dark night a violent storm attacked Thika. The rumbles of the thunders filled strength in all the hearts of the people in Nairobi. People felt that something unusual would happen soon. Suddenly a sword-like -lightening struck the fig tree. People were shook [vp5,-s]  be [fm1,-]  the great image. The next day people found the tree began [vp1,3-2]  to wither. The news spread quickly from Nairobe to every part of Kenya. The whole country was threaten [vp7,4-5]  to a flood of excitement. Kibiru's prophecy proved to be true. In the following days visitors from all parts of Kenya came to cheer the withering of the sacred tree. All people were permeated with an excitement atmosphere. They were waiting for another storm hopefully. The mystical moment came at last. By the day Keya officially [aj1,-2]  became independent, the tree had decayed completely. Yes, the tree was dead, but it gave it's [pr4,2-4]  life to a new country. Every day there were many people stood [vp5,4-6]  in front of the remained high wall to revere the great sacred tree. The policeman who picked him up was ordered to send him back by ship. During the voyage he felt sick, cold and hungry though the man took good care of him. His worried parents had learnt the news and had been waitting for him at the harbor for a long time.  No sooner had he landed than he dasked to his parents. His other bursted [fm2,-] out of tears and embraced him warmly, " oh [fm3,-] , my dear, my son..." One day later he decided to return to school. ut he wondered if he would be punished " Yes, I can ran [vp9,2-1]  away again since I have had the experience." As soon as he came in the classroom, to his surprise, all boys were waitting [fm1,-]  for him. They ran to him and lifted him up, asked him all sorts of questions and made a great noise. Suddenly the headmaster stepped in and all boys became quiet, stood still and looked at him. " I'll punish you, boy", the headmaster said seriously, " That is --- you have to give a talk to the whole school about your experience abroad." " Urrah! " the whole class stired [fm2,-]  again.   I should say carelessness is not a good point though it is a characteristic of mine. Often when I want to go to bed can I remember that I've left my night clothes in the bathroom since the morning. Or sometimes I will take other's umbrella without realizing the mistake for a whole week. One day an old friend came to visit me form [fm1,-]  my hometown and I was so excited that I borrowed a camera to take some significant photographs. We walked around the campus, talking and laughing. She was really moved by the beautiful scence [fm1,-] so she took the camera and aimed at any thing impressed her strongly. I just walked beside her, holding the case of the camera without consciousness. We spent a whole a happy morning on [wd4,1-1]  campus and when we came back to my dormitory I suddenly found there was nothing in my had [fm1,-] ! Where was the case? We dsahed [fm1,-] out immediately because we both were sure it must have been left somewhere in the school roads. But to our great disappointment we could not find it any more. I was very worried because I knew I could not buy a special shape [wd5,3-3]  case like that to suit the camera. We sat in a low spirit, face to face. Suddenly she exclaimed, " why [fm3,-] , it is in your pocket!" Oh, my God, I must have put it there thoughtlessly. In a dark night a prisoner of war managed [vp5,-5]  escaping from his barred camp and killing [vp5,7-2]  his guard. After hiding the body he dressed himself the guard. After hiding the body he dressed himself the guard's uniform quickly and coolly. Then he marched out of the camp up and down with a rifle over his shoulder like a guard. People soon found that a prisoner had escaped and the alarm was sounded harshly. Many soldiers gathered quickly and formed four teams to search the " missing prisoner". The prisoner was assigned in team No.1. Filled with armed soldiers and guards, four lorries rushed into the darkness. The prisoner held his rifle tightly and looked around vigilangly [fm1,-]  just like others. His heart was full of excitement and nervousness. Thirty minutes later, they came to the countryside. The commender [fm1,-]  ordered the soldiers to search the forest scatterly [fm2,-] . So all the soldiers marched into the forest and gradually dispersed. The prisoner soon disappeared without notice and never came back. I never find anything valuable by chance, however, I often lose things. The most favourable [wd3,2-5]  thing I've ever lost was a blue frock. It was hung in the shop window and I was attracted by it at the [wd5,1-2]  first sight. I decided to buy it. The next four months I led a hard life because I saved every penny and had no ice cream at all. But now, I had it! You can imagine how excited I was when I put it on in front of the mirror. But I found it was a little dirty because it had been hung for so long a time. I washed it carefully and hung it in the yard to dry. Then I went out to play tennis with Rose as we man [wd5,24-]  planned the day before. After four hours' exercise I was tired out. No sooner when [cj1,-10]  I stepped into the yard than I remembered my frock. I ran to see if it was dried. To my great surprise, it was not there! There were clothes of any kind except [wd4,6-2]  blue frock. I tried to calm myself and thought hard the scence [fm1,-] when I hung it. It was noon and my neighbours were taking their nap. They said when they got up they never saw a frock as I described. I must [vp9,-s]  be sure that someone passed by and was attracted by my dear frock and took a chance tool [wd7,-s]  it away. I miss my frock so much that till today when I see people wearing in [wd5,1-2]  blue frocks I will stop and watch them. I felt relief when my wife opened the window. But to my great surprise, she seemed shocked when she saw me and called loudly for help to the cop. She must misunderstood [vp9,1-] [wd3,-s]   me a thief." I am sure you will enjoy cleaning windows of the prison tonight." The cop said as he pulled me down the ladder. Just at that moment my wife seemed to recognize me because she asked hesitately [fm2,-]  it [wd3,-s]  I was Jack. " For goodness sake, who do you think I am!" I shouted. She hurried out and explained to the policeman hat I was her husband and she really felt sorry and she thanked him very much and she thought he could leave then. The cop looked to [wd5,0-1] be confused but he gave a salute to my wife after aking [fm1,-] sure I was er blown- in-the glass husband. Then he turned to me, " I am very sorry, sir, but I hope next time you can clean your window at daytime." A close Friend. Tall Emma has a full figure. Her long hair waves on her back and glimmers in the sunlight. When she smiles, her black eyes berd [fm1,-] like a crescent, and her little white teeth books [wd3,5-2]  very eye- catching because of her dark healthy skin. I once heard people asked [vp5,2-6]  her if she was a [np7,-1]  actress or a model. Whenever and wherever she is, there are many guys around her. They ingratiate [vp1,1-1]  her and offer to do things for her, but she always refuses them skillfully like a grace [wd2,1-1]  lady. But when she is in the dormmitory [fm1,-] with us, she acts very naughtly [fm1,-]  and cheerfully, like a baby. She likes treating us a song before the electricity being cut off every night. And she laughts [fm1,-]  loudly when she hears a joke, no matter it is really humorous or not. She looks like the happiest girl in the world. Joe, a red faced fishman [fm1,-], usually went to a quiet bay within [wd3,-3]  is small boat to catch fish for supper, though he never caught any ish [fm1,-] heavier than 10 pounds. But that time it seemed God was showing some mercy to him. He suddenly found an extraordinary huge fish was hooked. It jumped in rage, stiring [fm1,-] [fm2,-]  the sea. "well [fm1,-]  ou [fm1,-] won't give up, so [cj1,-s]  will I." Murmured Joe. He struggled in the rocking boat, despite the danger of capcizing [fm1,-] . But it just wouldn't surrender, like the fish in Hemingway's novel. Joe uffered [fm1,-] a lot, recollecting his energy and will power [fm2,-]  again and gain, Joe finally landed the fish just before he completely xhausted [vp1,2-] . But it was not the end. The storm came, the turbulence and roughness of the sea made it nearly impossible for him to reach the shore. But Joe was more determined after the struggle with the fish. Now it was the turn for [wd3,-s]  the fight with the fate, " I won't be beaten [vp9,3-] [sn9,-]  " Joe exclaimed, and he did [vp7,8-]  not. When he finally stepped through the threshold [np1,3-3]  of his home, his wife, irritating by waiting [wd4,1-1]  fish for supper, glared at the fish with wide open mouth. She was so excited that she kept talking while she was cleaning the fish. Joe sat comfortably, watching her, extremely tired but full of joy. Suddenly she stopped, motionless. Joe stood up and approached her strangely o see what had happened. And he suddenly stopped, too. There, inside the fish's stomach, was his wife's wedding ring lost two years earlier when she bathed. GUFL and Zhong shan University. I am now studying in Guang zhou [fm2,-]  University of Foreign Languages. Last mouth I happened to visit Zhong shan [fm2,-]  University and was pleased to notice there were some differences between the two universities. Firstly, the roportion [fm1,-] of girl students [sn8,s]. In my school, girls nearly make up two thirds of the whole visited [,-s]  me here last term," As soon as I walk in [wd3,-2]  the campus I know boys here are either very few or very tender here, because grass on the football field is so thriving." And another one joked it [pr1,-s]  was a matrilineal commune. While in Zhong shan [fm2,-] University, there is a completely different scene. Vigorous boys can be seen everywhere, they are running, jumping, playing tennis, speaking and laughing loudly. A temperament of manliner [fm2,-]  prevails the who [fm1,-]  campus. Secondly, the sports facilities. [sn8,s] In GUFL here, we have only one small gym, four informal roomed badminton courts, one no-rank swimming pool, which changes water every two weeks [sn9,-]  some basketball and volleyball courts, and a football field. The ground of those three tennis courts are concrete( but they still charge). Despite [pp1,-11]  I've stayed in Zhong shan [fm2,-]  University for only 24 hours, I notice how different their swimming pool and tennis courts were. The water in their swimming pool is pleasantly blue( which is changed every day) instead of oily green, which is the color of our water. And my friend told me it was one of the toppiest [aj3,3-]  even in whole china [fm3,-]  .Tennis courts with plastic and rubber ground are everywhere, I don't know the exact number, but surely is [,-s]  much more than 3. I haven't visited other facilities, but I am impressed enough. CECL, communicative English for Chinese Learners, is the main course for the first and second school year in our institute. When the bell rings the teacher walks into the classroom, [sn9,-]he greets us " Good morning" and then asks one of us to do " orning [fm1,-] report" that is to say, to respect [cc3,-4]  or recite some new [fm1,-]  we heard from VOA the previous evening. Then we will make some omments [fm1,-], either about the news itself or the students' performance. Usually that will last for 10 to 15 minutes, [sn9,-]  ometimes [fm1,-] we hold different opinions so the comments go up to dispute. If it's about some significant issues the teacher will not interrupt in [wd5,1-]  otherwise he will ask us to discuss it after class. Then we finish this " warm-up" exercise and begin with our textbook, we open it and find the place we stopped at [vp7,1-3]  [wd5,-2]  last tiem [fm1,-] . ( You're [vp7,1-3]  seen our textbook so you know its style) Actually the book is a large group of tasks, [sn9,-]  we do the tasks one by one accordingly, [sn9,-]  if it asks us to read some articles, we read. If it asks us [vp5,2-4]  listen to some tapes, we listen. So the process of the class is only a revival of the process of the textbook, it is very systematic and simple. The point, or the spirit of CECL course if [wd7,-s]  its textbook. When you have a CECL course, you do not need to think too much, just do what you are required, till the bell rings again. But after class you should spend a lot of time reciting those numerous new words.( it is a revenge, or rewards? ) Friend brother. We take it for granted that he should help me and I should help him. He will ask him how he's going on with his girlfriend. He will pat my head when I smile and hold me when I cry. He will phone me sometimes, for nothing, " just [fm3,-]  want to hear your voice. " He will write to me. He will say he cannot lend his umbrella tome [fm2,-]  because he also need it and then promise to buy a new one for me as my birthday gift. He will worry about me when I am travelling. He will not report what I have done to my parents or teachers. He will laugh loudly before me. He will go to skate with me when I am alone and ask me to skate with him when he is alone. He will ask me if I have had meal at 12 o'clock. He will tell my classmates he is my brother. He will do some homework for me when I am too busy or too lazy. I will buy the ticket of " the [fm3,-]  age [fm3,-]  of innocence [fm3,-] " for him when he's busy in playing football. I will lend my favourite book to him and ask him to return after a month. I will think of him when I need money. I will write to him. I will phone him and never put the receiver down first. I will love him, because he is [wd4,1-1] brother, my friend. 

< ST 5> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GDUFS> <AGE ?> <WAY ?> <DIC ?> <TYP 2>??? Sear [wd3,-1]  Dicle,    I'm really very sorry to say that I feel quite uncomfortable because of the noises from you everyday.    At  5 o'clock in the morning, your radio is broadcasting "the hijack in china [fm3,-] " and  " riots in Los ngelos [fm1,-] ", while I am still is bed, spending the next tormenting 2 hours. At lunch time, when I [wd4,1-4]  sitting at the table, ready to enjoy my favorite " roast duck" ,the roaring and never-ending cry of Jimmy, your little son, comes to my ears and makes me sit at the table, [sn9,-]without appetite. After lunch when I am in bed again for a nap, your little Mary(is it? ) is hammering on the floor, giving me another 2 tomenting hours.    In the evening I have  to put 2 cotton balls into my ears before I start to read my favorite book" Gone with the Wind", because the disco music from upstairs is not only shocking [wd3,-3]  my whole room,but also my head. And I have to stay up till 2' clock in the morning, waiting for the music to stop.   You know, I havn't got enough money to buy a new flat and I rally don't want to break down at this age. I hope you will understand me and help me.                                                           Truely [fm1,-] [wd4,-s]  ,                                                           Chen. Classes I have Attended      There are two kinds of classes I have attended: Useful and useless. No matter they are useful or useless, I have to attend them throughout the terms.   Almost [wd4,-s]  of the classes I have attended are very useful. I am very interested in these classes and pay great attention to them. I come to these classes 5 minutes before the class begin and eave them 10 minutes after the classes are over, asking questions to the teachers. During the classes, I take down every word of the teacher. I have my eyes on the teachers throughout the classes. I have never missed any homework of these classes. In these classes ,I learn how to write an English address for my neighbour, I learn how to talk with a foreigner on the train.   The rest of the classes I have attended are completely useless.   I have never been in time for these classes. More often than not , I leave these classes 15 minutes before the teachers leave.    During these classes, I either play my " game boy", or make plans for inviting my girlfriend, Mimy, to Kara OK. I neither listen to the teachers nor take notes. I even do not known [vp9,4-3]  the teachers 'names when the school year comes to an end. Actually, I got nothing from these classes.   These are the classes I have attended, I hope all the classes I attend will be useful in the future. Shi Zui Xian and Yun Bei  Beside the north gate of GIFL, there are two Da-pai-dangs , [sn9,-] One is called Shi Zui Xian, the other is called Yun Bei.    I often go to ShiZui Xian for dinner, but seldom go to Yun Bei because the enviroment [fm1,-] of Shi Xui Xian is much better than that of Yun Bei.   Behind ShiZuiXian, there are green fields while [fm1,-]  make people feel comfortable, while behind YuBei, there is a stinking ditch which makes on [fm1,-]  lose appetite at once. The rooms of Shi Zui Xian are well ventilated and very bright, while those of Yun Bei are not. The rooms of Shi Zui Xian are also more spacious than those of Yun Bei. It is very quiet in Shi Zhi Xian,nevertheless [sn9,-]  It [fm3,-]  is very noisy in Yun Bei. As She xui [fm3,-]  Xian is much farther to the highway than Yun Bei, the air in shixui [fm3,-]  Xian is much cleanner [fm2,-]  and clearer than that of Yun Bei. So, I really think that Shi Zui Xian is a much better place for dinner than Yun Bei.     CECL is a now [wd3,1-1]  approach developed by GIFL for Chinese learners of English to develop their communication ability. This class usually consists of listening, reading, talking, writing activities, So you need to get your textbook, vacaburary [fm1,-] list, earphone, pen and of course, your partner ready before attending your class.    First of all, you should preview the vocaburary [fm1,-] list because there's no time for you to learn the new words in class. The class usually begins by doing some listening activitis [fm2,-] . This time you just listen to the tape played by the teacher and do the exercises in the book. . After that, you should be prepared to answer the teacher's questions. Then omes [fm1,-] the reading activity, which is usually some fast-reading materials, Again, year [wd3,-8]  will have to do a lot of exercises, such as summary of a text, gap-filling, comprehensive questions. What follows reading is usually the writing task, [sn9,-]  you are often required to write a short paragraph or something else , [sn9,-] The most interesting thing of the class is the talking activity, in which the class usually ends. In this activity, you should form either in pairs, or in groups, The topics are usually given in the book. Sometimes you have debates besides discussions with your classmates. Quite often you  will finish your class in great exhaustion and of course, you will learn a lot in this class.   Boredom  Boredom is the feeling that one has when he has too much to do or has nothing to do. When a person has too much of something, he will certainly have the feeling of boredom, no matter how interesting the thing he first feel is, [sn9,-]  when there is othing [fm1,-] for one to do, this same feeling will certainly come up. For a student, this feeling appears always [ad1,3-]  when the [fm1,-]  hurrying [vp4,2-2] [wd3,-2]   the homework; for a husband, this feeling appears always [ad1,3-]  when his wife prepares the same dish for him, or wears the same pajamas, [sn9,-]  for a lover, maybe when he or she always receives flowers from the same person [sn2,-s] .   Actually, No [fm3,-]  one in this world that doesn't have boredom [sn2,-s] . Everyone is complaining about boredom and trying to get rid of it. However [sn9,-]  every day [fm2,-]  everyone is creating new boredom if he his [fm1,-]  succeeded [vp1,-2]  to abandon the old-which is not often the case.   Boredom results from all kinds of things, from doing homework, from travelling on business, from greeting [vp1,-1]  to people, or even from drinking beer--which is longed for by most of people.   Boredom is something of great varities [fm1,-]  , which no ne an escape from.  I waited and waited at the busstop for a No 10  Bus. "Excuse me." Suddly [fm1,-]  a voice came from behind. I looked back and found a man of Middle [fm1,-]  age looking anxiously at me.   "Well", [sn9,-]  he said even more anxiously, "Could you tell me how I can get to Jiang Cun?"    I was quite familiar with that place, and pointing to the board of the bus stop, I said " Bus No. 36 will take you right there." And I turned back from him to see whether my bus was coming.   "Bus No 3?" he said again, pulling my shirt. "And how much does the ticket cost?"   " 40 Fen, " very impationatly [fm1,-]  I said to him.    " Oh, 40 fen," he said, seemingly even more anxiously. " Well, could you please give me 40 fen for the ticket ?"    " Why?" I became a little bit angry.   " I'm very sorry [sn9,-] " he said, putting his bag in front of me. " You see, my bag was cut by a theif [fm1,-]   and the thief left me nothing. I just want 40 fen to return home."    This time my anger disappeared and groped in my wallet for 40 fen. However, I could not find the small changes. " I'm very sorry, [sn9,-]  I really have no small change and the smallest note is 10 Yuan."    No sooner than I had finished saying, he said happily, "Ok, I can give you the change of 9.6 yuan !"    I said nothing.

< ST 5> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GDUFS> <AGE ?> <WAY ?> <DIC ? > <TYP 2>??? A  meal  I saw a table with many things on it in the sitting room when I was opening [vp6,-s]  the door. I was sure my mother had prepared supper for my father and I .   This was a round shaped and black table with four legs. There were three, white chairs which were folding were [wd5,0-4]  put white folding chairs were put around the table. And then, on the table, there was a vase which was made of glass in the centre of the table. Around the  vase, there were two later [wd7,3-9]  and one soup bowl were [wd5,-s]  placed in good order. You can [vp6,-s]  see a deep fried fish in the plate, another plate with some oil white vegetables in it, and the the [wd6,1-1]  soup bowl was foul [fm1,-]  of sour and spicy soup . All that seemed like [wd5,3-2]  very delicious. And then three small bowls with [wd5,3-3]  full of rice were placed around the plates and the soup bowl. Each bowl was occupied [vp7,3-5]  one third of the table area and near the table --edge. On the right of each bowl. [sn2,-s]  There was a pair of chocksticks [fm1,-]  which was red.   I saw my father sat [vp4,4-3]  on one chair, He looked like watermouth [fm2,-]  eager for the meal.     West Virginca [fm1,-]  Coal Miner's House is one corner of west [fm3,-]  Virginia Coal Miner's House [wd7,-s] . On the wooded [fm1,-]  floor [sn2,-s] . You can see many black powder on it. It looks a bit dirty. There is a rocking chain [wd3,-s]  on the floor. It is made of cane. On the Chain [fm3,-] [wd3,-s]  , there is a soft cushion on it. This cushion is black and white.   On the right of the chair [sn2,-s] . There are two blank papers are [wd5,-s]  put on the floor .On the left of the chain [wd3,-s] , about one meter [sn2,-s] . (there is ) a broom stands there. The head of the broom lean [vp3,5-3]  against  the wall.There are many [np8,-2]  coal powder on the broom head. There are two colourful advertismert [fm1,-]  posters on the wooden wall. The first poster is two happy graduated students in black stand [vp4,-s]  on the globe. On the low of the globe [sn2,-s] . Where reads "You can always shop to adventage [fm1,-]  in the drag [fm1,-]  store [sn2,-s] ".The  second poster is put on right of the first one. A little higher than the first one [sn2,-s] , [sn9,-]  Inside the poster,there is a Santa Claus who tables [wd7,-s]  a bottle of coca cola on the right hand.You can find another big bottle of coca cola one the left of the Santa Clause. On the top of this poster where [,-s]  read "The pause that keeps you going [sn9,-] " These two posters are cut carefully.                        Waiting   On one old [cc4,1-1]  morning in the winter [sn2,-s] . A man and his two little daughters are standing in front of a gate which is made of iron. The man wearing a black windcoat [fm2,-]  and blue jeans has brown curls. From his wrinkly hand and rough profile. I can say he is a blue-collar worker. The little daughter sitting on his [pr3,5-2]  father 's shoulder is two. Years old [sn2,-s] . She is wearing a white coat which is furry. Her white hair looks a little rumpler [fm2,-] . She is sitting comfortably. Her father is holding  her tight [cc4,-1]  leg. Another little girl with white culls [wd7,5-]  wearing a flowered long wind coat [fm2,-]  and a short skirt is four years old. She is standing beside her father, putting  her hands into her pockets.    They look a little sad and very tired. May be [fm2,-]  They [fm3,-]  have walked a long way and came here to find their mother. Because the man had a quarrel with his wife about a trivial matter yesterday. [sn2,s] So his wife left home and went to her count's[fm1,-] family on impulse. This room No. 27 is her aunt's house. They got up very early this morning and came here for apology. They are looking through the gates eagerly and waiting for someone to open the locked door. I do hope his wife will forgive him.                       In the morning    I usually get up at 6: 30 .The broadcast [wd2,1-1]  station of our campus wakes me up every morning. The first thing I do is to make my bed. Then I get dressed from the cloth hanger [wd7,-s] .   After washing, I begin to prepare my breakfast. I put some water into my electric cup. When the water is boiling, adding [,-s]  two spoons of milk powder into the water and stiring [fm2,-]  it, and then put three or four square [cc4,-1]  sugar. As soon as the milk is boiling, I breaking [vp4,-s]  an egg into the milk and mix it together. Wait are [wd7,-s]  minute, [sn9,-] it is ready to have. I have milk and biscuit [np6,4-]  for my breakfast. Maybe I pay much attention to my breakfast, because it makes me full of energy during the day.    After I finished [vp6,-s]  my breakfast at 7:00 [sn2,-s] .I begin to listen to the radio--VOA, but sometimes I can't get the clear signal, so I listen to the China Radio now and then. Until 7:30 [sn2,-s] . I prepare [vp1,-2]  to class, combing my hair, wearing shoes. Patting [wd3,-s]  the books into the bag. [sn9,-]  Etc. At 7:45. I walk on my way to the classroom [sn9,-]      To be a secretary is not as simple as you  think. Guangzhou is an attractive city. Since the open policy was practiced in 1978. Its economy is developing at a rapid rate. People think that Guangzhou is an ideal place to earn money. So many people crowd here to make a living. Especially the people from mothern [fm1,-]  China.   Lifany was one of this kind of persons. She was twenty years old with a pretty face. She know [vp6,-s]  a young man who came from Guangzhou in her hometown--Liao Lin province. The young man told her that he could find a good job for her in Guangzhou. One monthly paid [wd2,2-]  was equal to one year's in her hometown. Lifang was attracted by his sweat [fm1,-] words and trusted him. She followed the young man to come [wd5,0-1]  to Guangzhou one month past [wd2,-] , [sn9,-]  the young man did not find a job for her. Li fang [fm3,-]  began to feel anxious because she almost ran out of her money. She asked the young man when she could work.. The young man told her that he had found a secretary job. The paid [wd2,1-5]  would be one thousand yuan per month, and she could also have a room which was given by the boss. He took Li fang to the room and asked her to wait for her boss there for interview . Lifang did as the young man said. She stayed in the room alone after the young man left. The room had nothing except a bed and a chair. After a while, someone opened the door with a key. A sixty year old man entered into [wd5,1-2]  the room. He closed the door and locked it. He looked sinister with his belly stuck [vp5,6-1]  out. When he saw Lifang, he sprang on her liked wolf. Lifary was frightened and struggled hard to get free. The old guy told her coldly that he had paid the young man 30,000 yuan for buying her. If she did not obey him, she had to pay back to him. So that [cj1,-s] , all her happiness was ruined poorly.    After I leant [fm1,-] that, the idea which was to be a secretary in the future was given up. Athough [fm1,-]  not all are the same case, I know I have to choose my job carefully. Mrs  Landlord:   I am sorry to bother you, but I can not stand the noise come [vp1,3-3]  from the [wd5,1-2]  upstair, since they moved in, I never have a good time. If the noisy [wd2,1-]  continue [vp3,2-] . [sn9,-]  I think I can do nothing except breaking the contract with you and move out immediately.    I was told there are three girls living together above me. I don't understand why they make noise all the time. It seems they never get tired. In the morning, when the sky still is dark, they begin to do morning exercise [np6,2-] . [sn9,-]  In [fm3, -]  the room, running, jumping and even singing. Sounds [np3,-1]is very disgusting. I'm afraid that them [pr4,-] floor will fall down one[wd7,5-]. [sn8,s]I look at the clock, [sn9,-]oh, my godness [wd3,2-] , It [fm3,-]  [wd4,-s]  a [wd5,-s]  only five. I can not sleep any more. So drinking coffee in the morning has become my  hobby. In order to make me awake [sn2,-s] . In the evening, I usually do my homework till 10.Every time, when I am thinking about something, I always [ad1,-s]  be [vp4,2-4]  disturbed by sharp shouting, chatting or laughing. And they [wd5,-s]  the voice [wd3,1-3]  of the TV set can be heard a mile away. So I can not concentrate my mind on study, [sn9,-]  I just go to bed, [sn9,-]  But when I lay [vp6,-s]  down on the [wd5,1-1]  bed, them [pr4,-3]  mini concert begin I can hear a few boys join their party. [sn1,s] After I heard [vp6,-s]  the Rock and Roll's music, I lost [vp6,-s]  my appetite. I usually say to myself, [sn9,-]  Please allow me to have a good night. [sn9,-]      Read 10,000 volumes and travel 10,000li. I have travel [vp9, 2-]  two places, Xian and Hangzhou. I think I prefer scenic spots to ncient relics.   Last summer vocation. [sn2,-]  I went to Xian with some friends for travel. I was told that xian [fm3,-]  [wd4,-s]  a [wd5,1-3]  an ancient city and has many historical monuments. We traveled the tomb of the Chinese Emperor and thousands of life. [sn9,-]  Size [fm3,-]  terra- cotta figures.When I steped into there, I felt uncomfortable, [sn9,-]  every where [fm2,-]  is so serious, [sn9,-]  everyone's pace [wd3,1-3]  looked so sad. I could say nothing beautiful there, [sn9,-]  [wd4,-s]  only saw many clay figures, [sn9,-]  everywhere is so solemn. Though the guild [wd3,1-5]  explain [vp6,-s]  to us so patiently. [sn9,-] I could not enjoy it. Another thing  I disliked is that we could not take photo there. I didn't understand why, [sn9,-] that is one of them [pr4,2-1]  rules. The guide explained that the excavation of the underground [wd5,1-1]  vault of earth revealed thousands of terra-cotta warriors and their horses in battle fomation [fm1,-] , and the whole army would follow its emperor into immortality. I am not interested in ancient history, so I felt very dull and went out alone before they finished the visit.     After the travel of xian [fm3,-] . [sn9,-]  We [fm3,-]  went to Hangzhou. Hangzhou  has many senic [fm1,-]  spots. [sn9,-]  Such [fm3,-]  as Monastery of the Spirits' Retreal, Pagoda of six Hammories and West Lake. Hangzhou is famous for its west [fm3,-]  Lake, [sn9,-] it has such places of interest and Three Pools Mirroring the Moon. This is the second largest island in West ake--Landscaped [fm3,-]  in typical Chinese style. It has many small pavilions, terraces, display rocks and flower beds. The guide as a pretty girl .She told us the story about this island, I was so interesting [aj4,-s]  , [sn9,-]  Until now. [sn9,-] I can remember the whole story, and I often tell the other people, [sn9,-]  Then we traveled the lake by boat, [sn9,-]  The water was green clear and very quiet. We sat on [wd3,1-2]  the oat and enjoyed the beautiful scene. I suddenly pelt [fm1,-]  that I became a fairy maiden. [sn9,-]  Travling [fm1,-]  [fm3,-]  in the fairyland. On both side [np6,1-]  of [wd4,-s]  lake, there are two dikes--the Bai and the su [fm3,-] . On the each dike. [sn9,-] You [fm3,-]  can see a row of vigorous willow trees. They are decorated with coloruful light [np6,5-] , so in the evening, you can imagine how beautiful it is, [sn9,-]  There are many lovers under the tree [np6,6-] . This place is really strongly impressed on my memory. People say in heaven is paradise, [sn9,-] on earth are Suzhou and Hangzhou. This saying is true.     I have been to two kinds of restaurants . [sn9,-] The [fm3, -]  High [fm3,-]  class restaurant and the low class restaurant.    When you enter a high class restaurant, you must dress well. There is a beautiful girl at the door, standing behind a counter, [sn9,-]  she will ask you did you make reservation [,-s]  > [sn9,-] If not, she will lead you to a table. Then, two or three waitresses in uniform will come to you, [sn9,-]  one will make tea for you. [wd4,-2]  Other one will bring you a small hot towel. Another one will stand beside you, waiting [vp1,-4]  you to order food, [sn9,-]  she often introduces the most expensive food or drinks to you. She is so patient and hospitable  that you don't want to refuse her. She smiles broadly on her face, try her best to please you. She is so skillful [wd4,-s]  I sometimes wonder whether she graduated from public relation [np6,1-]  school. When you look around, everywhere is so quiet. People talk in low voice [np6,4-] . Of course, the environment and condition of the restaurant are luxurious. Maybe,some people think the food of the high clan [wd7,-s]  restaurant is cleaner than the low class one.I don't think so, [sn9,-]  I think the food is clean unless you go into their kitchen. The service charge of high lass restaurant will make you headache. During the meal, you can not talk freely. You must have good table manner [np6, 1-] . Sometimes, fter you finish your meal, you still feel hungry. But the bill of the meal is very expensive.   There  is not [np9,2-4]  this kind of case in low class restaurant. We usually call "Da Pai Dang" [sn9,-]  when [fm3,-] [wd4,-s] center [fm1,-]  there, you will feel more comfortable, [sn9,-] It seems everyone is your friend, [sn9,-] you will feel [vp1,-2]  like stay at your home, [sn9,-]  you can order food at your own will, [sn9,-] Although the environment is not o good, you feel so free. Instead of [wd4,1-3]  controlled by others. There is no service charge there and the tea is free too. You can talk willingly. After you finish the meal, you will think it is worth [aj2,-3]  to spend money there.                  Friend    Friend is one part of our life. Everybody has friend [np6,-s] . Some peoples [np6,-s]  have many friends. Because they like to make friends [sn2,-s] . They think friends are as important as their life. Without friends, they will feel lonely, [sn9,-] everything will became [vp9,2-1]  meaningless. And live a happy life [sn2,-s] . To other people, Making [fm3,-] friends is not them [pr4,-1]  interest.They think building up friendship with a friend is wasting time, and friends will bring them trouble. They enjoy loneliness. To another [np9,-s]  people,they don't the [wd7,2-2]  many friends. Two or three close friends are enough for them.    They found [vp6,-s]  real friendship only [ad1,-s]  can be built up among two or  three people. So, different people have different opinion [np6,4-]  to define friends.     A friend indeed is a friend in need. This is my definition of a friend. When I come across difficulty. [sn9,-]  She [fm3,-]  can give her hand to me. [sn9,-]  And [fm3,-]  tries her best to help me get out of trouble. In daily life, we can share joys and sorrows.   Once, I got fever. It was very serious [sn9,-]  I felt too sick [wd4,1-3]  go to class. In school [sn2,-s] . I can [vp6,-s] do nothing. Only lay in bed all the day [sn2,-s] . I didn't drink and eat, [sn9,-]  my illness became more and more serious.At that time, I missed my so [ad1,0-1]  much family, [sn9,-]  I even cried on the bed. Susan knew this, [sn9,-]  she came to my room quickly after class. [sn9,-]  And [fm3,-]  gave me a few words of comfort. She took me to the school clinic. Cooked meal for me and took good care of me [sn2,-s] . I cried the second time. [sn9,-] Because [fm3,-]  I was so moved that I could not help crying .I realized I really had a real friend.    In my daily life. [sn9,-] I observed some different phenomenon [np6,1-] which people treat their friends.[sn8,s] When some girls have boy friend [np6,4-] , they don't like to make other friends, even girlfriend [np6,-s] . They think a boyfriend is enough for them. They only like to spend all the spare time with their lover [np6,1-] . To me. [sn9,-]  I can't accept this. This will make me crazy. [sn9,-] And [fm3,-]  become more and more unsociable and uncommunicative.     Rose is my roommate. She is very lovely and amiable. We always play together, going to the classroom hand in hand every morning, making joke in our dormitory. Weeven [fm2,-]  talk [cc3,-1]  heart [wd4,-s]  each other. She has become my close friend since we knew each other. Many times, after she went back home, I felt very lonely on [wd4,-1]  campus and waited for her return.     Yesterday morning, something happened to us, [sn9,-]  I am used to listen[vp4,2-] to the VOA at 7:00 AM.  So I get up earlier than Rose. Other roommates usually go out very early. So rose and I are the last two ones[wd4,-] to leave. The room was so  quiet yesterday morning. I knew only Rose was still in bed. I concentrated my mind on the VOA report. Suddenly, I felt two hands was holding my neck tightly behind me." Oh, ghost!' I couldn't  help jumping up from the chain and crying [sn9,-]  and [fm3,-]  then. [sn9,-]  I turned back, "Oh,my God, it is you," I shouted angrily, "You want to scare me to die [wd2,3-] "? [sn9,-]  I felt a little pain on my neck, [sn9,-]  "I just wanted to play with you, [sn9,-]  I didn't mean it, [sn9,-]  why you are [wd1,-s]  so angry [aj2,-2]   to me" She replied and her voice seemed almost to cry. I didn't look at her and sat back to my chain [wd3,4-] . She walked away. We didn't talk to each other for a long time. I thought of [wd5,0-1]  myself [wd5,-] that maybe I was too serious just now, [sn9,-]we always make joke. I persuaded myself to forget it. I looked at the watch. It was nearly the time for clan [wd7,-s] . I took the bookbag [fm2,-]  and walked to the chain [wd3,-s] . " Shall we go to the classroom [sn9,-] " I said gently.    She still kept silence on our way to classroom. I told her a humorous conversation. Last Sunday was my birthday and my mother asked me. [sn9,-]  " What kind of gift do you want me to send you [sn9,-]  " [sn9,-]  I prefer  a peace  and  quiet environment [sn9,-] " I answered. My mother entered into [wd5,1-2]  my room and moved out my treasured recorder. eally, This [fm3,-]  humorous conversation gained Rose's smile.

< ST 5> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GDUFS> <AGE ?> <WAY ?> <DIC ? > <TYP 2>?? Dear sir.  I have been your downstairs neighbour for nearly one year. I am quite heartened to have a hard-working and easy-going neighbour like you. However, in recent mouths, I have been suffering a great deal of noise coming from your apartment which makes me quite upset and to [sn6,5-2]  write you this letter.    For the past two months, almost every afternoon, I found it hard to fan [wd3,5-]  asleep while your recorder kept playing certain music. Although most of the songs were my favourites as well, I did find they wore [fm1,-] not played at a right time, for I think the eriod of time between 1:00p.m and 2:30 p.m should be the time f st. I am not criticizing your schedule here,but I do need uiet as your neighbour. Yesterday, you kept playing the Rock  roll [fm2,-]  songs in a loudly [wd2,2-1]  voice throughout the afternoon and I was orced to go out for a walk instead of sleeping.      I used to have  the habit of going to bed early at night. But I am now changing it for your sake. Every night you return rather late and make a lot of noise which awakes me quite often.    Last Saturday night I was awaken [vp7,2-2]  to find it was three o'clock in the morning. Again I am not blaming you for your habit, but I would be most grateful if you could make your steps softer and your movement less noisy on return. It always took me half an hour to wait for the end of the noise of the bumps of door and chairs [sn9,-]  etc. Your final two heavy bumps of throwing your leather shoes sometimes almost  frightened my heart to jump out.     Living in the same building, I think we have got to establish a good relationship between us, which simply means our mutual respect to each other. I hope you will share  my opinion and allow me a quiet and easy life. With my best regards.              Yours faithfully [sn9,-]                 Zhang Long             Parties I Have Been To  Three kinds of  parties have presented me with various feelings:   festival party, birthday party and farewell party. They have brought to me happiness. [sn9,-]  Embarrassment [fm3,-]  and even sadness.    Festival party is the kind that I enjoyed most. For I did feel happy in attending it. Festival party is for everybody and ll the attendance [wd3,-s]  have the chance to participate [vp1,-2]  the activities rather than just sit and watch. While celebrating the festival n forms of singing. [sn9,-]  Dancing [fm3,-]  and cheers. We could all sense the gay atmosphere then and wore [fm1,-]  delighted that colorful new days were coming soon. I met lots of acquaintances in the parties, who were equally cheerful as I was.When talking about the impression,we all agreed that the party was great.    Birthday party sometimes made me feel bored and embarrassed, for I was sometimes invited to a stranger's birthday party. Not knowing how to formulate my best wishes, I sat there in silence, ith a forced smile  on the face, This always made people feel that I was uncommunicative and I often failed to give any xplanation to redeem my image. Even when attending a friend's birthday party I still felt uncomfortable. Since I considered myself a close friend of the host, I used to act like a bee, often talking many [np8,-2]  irrelevant nonsense ,doing many unnecessary things. I used to attract so much attention that the host, who had expected to be the key man in the party, became unhappy with me. And it has always been too late for me to realize that I had made myself ridiculous.   Farewell party is the kind of party bringing me unspeakable sadness. The atmosphere of it had been expected to be joyful. But we always failed to restrain our reluctant feeling to part and the party used to end up in a sad atmosphere, with everybody in tears or in a bad mood.     There will certaintly be more parties ahead for me to ttend. I will also be supposed to behave properly. I wish there would e some new kinds of parties different from those I have tended nd I could feel happier and comfortable in them.             Two Different Schools   Guangzhou University of Foreign Languages (GUFL) and Linan University are surely of two different types as far as their environment. [sn9,-]  Academic [fm3,-]  atmosphere and entertainment activities [sn9,-]  etc are concerned.    Locating [vp5,-s]  at the foot of Baiyun Mountain , GUFL enjoys a autiful and tasteful [cc4,-1]  environment, Which [fm3,-]  allows its people to work and study in a peaceful way. One can be free of the noise and excitement downtown, breatheing [fm2,-]  the pure and fresh air here and taking  a rest on the meadows or in the shadows of the trees.    As to INU. [sn9,-]  Which [fm3,-]  lies nearly at the center of the city, the noise and the polluted air from the busy traffic nearby and the [wd5,-3]  several large markets and shops surrounding it does [vp3,-s]  make people on the campus suffer a lot. Moreover, the four main gates of INU are usually open to the outside world, which makes people outside always go in for a sightseeing or merely for a rest. So the school is now becoming more and more like a public park.     The academic atmosphere in INU seems to be more active than that in GUFL. Various kinds of lectures , discussions or debates are held in INU almost every week, focusing on international trade and finance issues [sn9,-]  stock market problems and social phenomena [sn9,-]  etc. Students take active part in these ctivities and bring their talents and knowledge from textbooks into full play. However. People in GUFL seem to be indifferent in such activities which will actually benefit them a lot. Occasionally you can have a public lecture or sth else, but most students are not very interested in it and the attendants [wd3,-s]  are always less active.     GUFL is proud of its colorful  entertainment activities which include singing contest. [sn9,-]  Dancing [fm3,-]  performance and poem reciting [sn9,-]  etc. Every season we have various activities to add colors to our life. All these activities are organized by the school and are all successful. In INU the situation is a bit different. Owing to its large scale, every department is responsible for its own mattes [fm1,-] . So you can only find some small scale entertainment activities held by each department. They thus don't cause any sensation. There are only few activities which are organized by the school and can round off.   CUFL and INU may have many things in common as an university. But they really differ in the above aspects.      How to learn the CECL Course     The full name of CECL is Communicative English for Chinese Learners. It is a course for English majors and is taken as a practice in GUFL.    This course emphasizes [vp1,-6]  more on training the student's ability of listening comprehension and spoken English and it also includes certain  amount of exercises for writing and reading. The whole textbook is divided into about forty units, each dealing with a topic of life, culture, history, geography science, medicine [sn9,-]  and [wd5,-s]  etc. In using this textbook, students will be instructed to do the reading. [sn9,-]  Listening [fm3,-] [sn9,-]   writing and speaking practice. All these exercises are concerned about [wd3,-] the topic of the unit. For example [sn9,-]  if the unit is about Cuisine [fm3,-] . [sn9,-]  You [fm3,-]  will need to read several passages about, say,the various styles of cuisine, the making of certain Chinese dishes, the proper [cc4,2-5]  wrong of using western table wares [sn9,-]  etc. Having gone through the passages, students will be instructed to some do exercises, say, writing down some points of the idea embodies [vp5,7-3]  in the passages. For the listening comprehension exercises, students will be required to listen to a dialogue or something else about how the foreigners feel about Chinese food or the process of cooking a Chinese dish [sn9,-]  etc. Students will then need to grasp the main ideas and write them down or to use the information they have heard  to fill in blanks or charts.     The most  active step in learning this course is the oral practice. Students will be  encouraged to discuss certain topics about the unit between them, Sometimes with the help and organization of the teacher, the students will have an animated debate. Through these oral practice [np6,2-] , the students will be able to not only practise their  spoken English, but also express their own ideas upon the  topic. Having finished the unit, the students will  usually be asked to write an essay or composition about  the topic they have dealt with, writing down their feelings  or impressions.     Before the teaching of each unit, students will be given a word [wd5,1-5]  list of the new words and phrases to help  them. A pair of earphones is also provided for each student for their listening exercises.    CECL does have many advantages in training students' comprehensive ability. It helps to broaden the students' knowledge as well. However, a lot of improvements are still needed to make it bettor [fm1,-]  serve the purpose of teaching English majors [sn9,-]               Friend     The dictionary has varied explanations for the word " friend " ranging from " person one knows and likes "to" helper  to " supporter " [sn9,-]  No matter how different [wd2,-s]  people view " a  friend" as [sn9,-]  surely there is one thing in common, [sn9,-]  a friend should be a person who is familiar with you and you two do enjoy a relationship.     When you are lonely and depressed, you may need a friend to be with you, for you need someone who is patient enough to listen to you and to propitiate your  sorrow or anger. A friend is a person who knows you well and is inclined to share your misfortune when you are in trouble. The friendship may make you believe that at least there are your friends in the world who will care about you and you may talk [wd3,-s]  to for help. Sometimes you may merely feel like to talk to someone to have our happiness shared by more people. Again you need your friends to be with you. You may have a good time together and this hilarity will surely drive away your loneliness. Some people may think that a friend is  a person who can  give help and support. But I would like to claim that a friend is a person whom you need not to wear disguise before. You may tell him or her your secret and he or she will keep it for you. When you suffer frustration in job, life and love [sn9,-]  etc. You may go to find your relief and pleasure in friendship. [sn9,-]  For [fm3,-]  your friends will assure you that they will always stand by you and be ready to help . A friend is a person whom you may go for help without the least hesitation and ceremony. A friends [np6,1-]  is a person who will do all the needed things for you without being asked for or paid for. I can not imagine what my life will be if I fail to find any friend but only emimies [fm1,-]  and hypocrites. My frends [fm1,-]  are part of my life. 

< ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GUFL> <AGE ?> <WAY ?> <DIC ?> <TYP 2>?? That was a rather cold winter morning. The wind was blowing so fiercely that it  [vp3,1-2] drive almost everybody back to his warm house. But there were a group of homeless people-a father and his two daughters.  [sn2,0-6] Wandering aimlessly in the long,  [fm1,-] peopleless [fm1,-] street. When they passed a gate which had a severe wire screen, their feet were tempted by a sweet song of hymn, [sn9,-]  Oh, [fm2,-] what a peaceful little song! " The father couldn't help looking through the window to  see  [fm1,-] what'  [vp5,2-0] happen.  [,0-4] He put  [wd7,2-2] is younger daughter, fm2,-] who was not more than 3 on his shoulder and let the older one stand beside him. They discovered a wonderful  [np5,4-7] work on the other side of the gate, a warm, cheerful, [fm2,-] totally different [wd4,5-6]  from the one they are living. There was a young, amiable mother sitting at a stove in which the cheerful fire is radiating its red, warm light generously to the [fm1,-] whold house. Several little children, who were tidy, lovely, were playing happily around their mother. They are singing, dancing, playing with their little dog. They apparently knew nothing about the cold world outside the room. [fm2,-] However, on the other side of the gate, you can't find any cheerfulness but sadness and the feeling of longing for something. The little girl sitting on his father's shoulder appeared to be totally attracted by the sign she saw. " [fm3,-] what a big cake they have! They have so many [np6,4-6] candy and a dog who can dance!" As she  [fm1,-] though of this, her mouth was watering. Something was glimmering in her bright blue eyes. Maybe that night she would have a good dream of cake and candy. But a gale of  [cc4,0-1] keen wind  [vp1,5-8] made the poor girl [vp9,4-2] couldn't help  [fm1,-] shiering with cold. [fm2,-]  [fm1,-] He elder sister with baggy clothes and rumblered [fm2,-]fair hair, was staring [vp1,-]that amiable mother.  Her eyes were directed by every movement of the woman. The other inside made she[pr4,1-] think of her own mother who left her only a vague but warm memory. The tears dimmed her eyes. [fm2,-] The father, who was as baggy as his two daughters, stared fishily forward. A deep  [np5,2-2] melancholy obviously remained on his face. He appeared to see nothing about the happy life inside because at that moment he was occupied by the hard work of thinking out a place for his two kids to sleep before dark. Every morning in the school, my life is just like a race in which I have to try best to get ahead. If not, I will surely be put in a very negative state. In cold winter morning, getting out of my warm bed is always a terrible thing for me. At about 6: 20 am, after a long struggle and self-encourage[wd2,2-0], I manage to leap from the bed in great strength and enormous speed, [sn9,-] This very action usually triggers a lot of  [np6,3-3] complaint from the person who is sleeping on the above bed. I have no time to listen to her nonsense because my mind is fully occupied by another urgent business-- capture a tap in the washing room! In the ten mintues from 6:20 to 6: 30 the  begin [wd2,1-3] of morning  [np6,1-0] exercise, the washing room is an  extrimely [fm1,-] popular place to go. I take a great  difficult[wd2,4-3]  in wedging myself into a  [wd7,4-3] chink between too people and begin washing. But how unfortunately I am, [sn9,-] [fm3,-] the person standing beside me has a habit of washing violently, splashing water everywhere on my face and clothes. But I have no time to quarrel for there are half  [np6,1-1] dozen people waiting behind. At that moment, I make a vow that next day I will get up very early! [fm2,-] Then there comes another fighting-racing to the playground at sonic speed. People are running with their wild hairs, a cloud of dirt like thousands of horses passing by. I am running in this army, looking firmly and [fm1,-] anxiouly at the destination, taking every slice of energy to try to touch the rushing line. But this time, not for the gold medal, just for not having my name recorded on the teacher's little muster  [fm1,-] boll for coming late. [fm2,-] The morning exercise lasts only five mintues. But you never think the annoying struggle is coming to the end. The five mintues exercise is a kind of relaxation for the later fiercer competition- [fm1,-] rashing to the student's dinning room. If you don't  [fm1,-] harry up a bit, you'll probabally have to wait in the line , and  [fm1,-] ore importantly, the most delicious food would have been sold  [fm1,-] ut. [fm1,-] Due to y   tremedous [fm1,-] speed, [fm2,-] I am always [wd4,3-3] the several persons who get to the dinning room first. So I get my breakfast  [fm1,-] easly.  [fm3,-] sometimes I have a bowl of rice noodle and sometimes one or two buns. Then I sit at the table and supplement the energy lost in the previous struggles. But  [fm1,-] alase! When I look at my watch, I find this only enjoyment is impossible. [sn9,-]  [fm3,-] Because I have to finish the breakfast and return back[wd5,1-] to the  [fm1,-] domitory before seven o'clock, the time for listening to English [fm1,-] programm in radio. So I devour those buns and  [np6,2-0] noodle and this fast movement of mouth makes my stomach uncomfortable a whole morning. [fm2,-] Then I succeed in reaching the  [fm1,-] domitory before 7:00.  Thanks Heaven, [sn9,-]  [fm3,-] before the class  [vp3,3-2] begin, I have a short period of time to release[wd3,-] a little bit after all.  At the railway station Waiting train in railway  [np6,1-0] station is almost a very happy and tiring experience in China,  [fm1,-] espetially  [fm1,-] her in Guangzhou.  [sn2,0-5] Because it is always over crowded. [fm2,-] Last winter holiday, I had an [fm1,-] unfotfetable experience in Guangzhou railway station. I got to the station one hour's early of the departure time. My friend Zhang saw me off and  [vp6,4-2] help me carry a big bag, [sn9,-]  [fm3,-] when we arrived, we were frightened by such a scene: [fm2,-] thousands or even millions of people huddled outside the station, [fm2,-] pushing o and fro, yelling and jostling. Most of them were peasants who came to Guangdong provinee [fm1,-] to find jobs and at that time they re about to go back home to spend  [np6,1-1] Spring Fastival [fm1,-] with their families. Many of them could not buy tickets and wandered all away outside the station. [fm2,-] When I took great trouble in wedging myself in the waiting room, I found I have my hand bruised. The situation there was not much better than outside. All the seats were occupied by peasants who unvariedly carried three or four bags with them, [sn9,-] Many without a seat simply sat on the ground. [sn8,s] Some even slept on the floor using their bag as  [np6,2-0] pillar and slumbered heavily. I looked around and discovered a seat was occupied by a very dirty big [fm1,-]  gunnysack which was obviously owned by the girl sitting beside. Actually, the girl was sleeping with her dust-covered face  [vp5,4-2] expose to everybody. [fm2,-] Her hair was wild like coarse grass. Her mouth opened slightly and slumbered. Her two legs opened widely and extented [fm1,-] to a long distant[wd2,2-0] but one of her  [np6, 3-5] hand was holding tightly her sack. All seemed that the girl concerned nothing about her manner. With great disgust, Zhang shouted at her " Hey! [fm2,-] Move away your bag!" This great voice seemed to  [fm1,-] starltle the girl, [sn9,-] [fm3,-] she opened her eyes suddenly and looked frightened like a hurt bird. At that time, I found the girl was very pretty, [sn9,-] [fm3,-] she looked at most 16 years old. Even with a lay of dust on her face you could find immediately that she had a very smooth and fair skin. She raised her amazing beautiful eyes looking at us heedly[wd7,-] and them quickly  [vp6,13-5] move the sack off the seat. [fm2,-] I sat down and smiled at her and she  [vp6,5-5] return me a sweet smile too. [fm2,-] Then we began a friendly chat. She told me about her parents, her younger brothers and sisters and  [fm1,-] them she claimed [fm1,-] poundly that she was good at pushing in the crowd and never bothered to buy a ticket and never failed to escape ticket checking. But Suddenly, she stopped her mouth and became watchful as if  [np7,4-3] a experienced hunting dog smelt something unusual. And then she spoke to me: "Get ready for pushing. Remember, ook [fm1,-] only ahead, [sn9,-] [fm3,-] push hard with all your strength forward!" Almost [wd4,1-3]  the same time, the crowd began to gather towards the door, [sn9,-] [fm3,-] everybody looked very determined and prepared for a war,  [sn9,-] [fm3,-] the great pushing forward movement began. Following the nimble girl who was like a fish swimming skillfully in the sea of people, I almost lost my sense. I didn't know whether my feet till touched the floor and my left arm pulling my bag behind still belonged to me. I only knew that somebody's leg would  vp9,3-2] tripped me up if the girl had not held my hand. Children were crying and women  [fm1,-] screened everywhere. [fm2,-] The situation was very dangerous. I couldn't reathe [fm1,-] and I just wanted to cry. I thought I was done for at that time. Something hooked my sweater and made a big hole in it. I almost ate the hair of the girl  [fm1,-] net to me. After about 10  [np4,2-2] minutes deadly struggle, I found myself standing on the train alive. What a nightmare! What a terrible experience! At that time, I thought of the beautiful girl and looked around the train, but I never saw her again.  [sn2,0-15] Since the tourist industry is flourishing in recent years, and more people are involved in it. Many young people are holding jobs as tourist guides. Like other occupations, the job of a guide has its own advantages and drawbacks so it is hard to say it is good or bad. Sometimes it can be very attractive and profitable, [sn9,-] Sometimes it will be rather unpleasant. A friend of mine who is working for CITs  [fm1,-] GuangZhou branch as a torist [fm1,-] guide, often has many stories about her job to tell. I remember that was a sunny spring day. She called on me [fm1,-] nexpectedly at my dormitory [fm1,-]. When I first saw her, I almost couldn't recognize her. She was rather thin, campared [fm1,-] with the  [wd7,7-5] precious time I had seen her, she seemed to have lost 5kg weight. [fm2,-] Her face was  [aj3,3-4] darker and full of weariness. " I am gong to die." She said with little energy as soon as she saw me. And then she began  [fm1,-] hr endless and angry complaint about her new job. She said with great dislike [sn9,-]  "Everyday I have to get up very early, sometimes there is even no time to finish [wd4,7-1]  breakfast. And then I have a group of people  [fm1,-]  [vp5,6-1] fellow me wherever I go, which makes me feel like a fool. Then you have to answer all kinds of silly questions raised by dozens of them. It is very boring. I have to repeat the same story hundreds of times and even so, still there are some foolish fellows who can not make clear and keep asking without an end. Usually, I can't have lunch in time which causes serious problems in my stomach. So, I advise you: Do not take up the job as a tourist guide, or you'll regret!" Knowing so much disadvantages of the job, I almost made up my mind that tourist  [np6,1-4] guide was the worst job in the world. Then I asked her: "How about changing, [sn9,-]   [pr4,3-1] you job and try to find another one?" "No, I won't [sn9,-] " she refused me without hesitation. "You know, though the job is rather tiring, it is really a money-making one. You get a lot of  [np6,5-4] tip if you are Lucky." Her answer confused me. Sometimes I just can't understand why people do things which they don't like. Is money so important? Maybe, I'll understand it in some future day. Gary Cooper was the kind of man who you will never forget once you see him. Even in a crowd of people you can have no trouble in pointing him out at once both because of his enormous height and a scarcely-seen stern face. He was in his late 30's and looked physically strong and mentally keen, advancing with big and rapid strides  [fm1,-] n the street where only a few numbers of people were wandering. One of his long  [np6,4-3] hand was swinging forcefully, accompanying [fm1,-] the movement of his legs, while the other hand seemed never to be moved away from the pistol hung on his loin. He was always watchful like  [np7, 1-3] a excellent hunting dog and prepared to draw upon the gun to deal with any unexpected attack at any time. He was wearing a smart white shirt and a pair of black trousers. A high quality black leather waistcoat was suitably covered on. He was wearing a belt round his waist in a casual way and a  [wd7,1-5] packet watch shining  [fm1,-] n the  [fm1,-] un. He had a long and ough [fm1,-] face with clear edges and corners. That kind of roughness was only owned by those who had experienced innumerable dangers nd [fm1,-] trauma. His nose was extremely long and straight which made you immediately associate with the one made of plaster stone. His mouth was held tightly and the corners of the mouth bent downward cynically. Although the brim of his hat had almost [fm1,-] elipsed his eyes, you could feel two columns of cold lights projected from them which would made everybody shiver with fear. His eyes was fierce and full of determination. There was always a slice of sneer hanging on his face where some kind of murderous intent was hiding behind. He was forging ahead with a face as cold as ice. There is no doubt that [wd4,5-2] unusual was about to happen at his destination.[sn8,s] Mrs Brown, I am writing to you to express my  [wd7,2-1] treat unsatisfaction [fm1,-] about the  [fm1,-] nbearable noises your family have made and your ignorance on [wd3,-] my last complaint letter. For this time, I have to admit that being a neighbour of your family is really a great suffering and a nightmare. I can hardly find a word to describe the disturbance you've brought to us. Every morning, Your family gets up as early as 6:00 and your warmming [fm2,-]  up morning exercise follows. I know your husband is a basketball coach, but it doesn't mean that he has the [wd4,s-] to bounce the ball heavily against the floor under which several people are still asleep. We are all waken up by such dreadful bouncing  [np6,3-0] noise and my old grandma is sually [fm1,-] frightened and made sick. After the ball stops making [np6,4-0] noise, I suppose [fm1,-] a family sportsmeet [fm1,-] is taking place, [wd4,14-2]  we hear  [np6,2-3] noise of rope skipping which vp3,5-5] sounds like a working cutting machine and then I guess you must have other activities, such as high jumping and hurdle racing. The enormously big noises come abruptly which can  [vp9,1-2] made people mad. I won't  [vp7,2-2] surprise one day there will be a hole  [vp5,5-3] appear in the floor and somebody will fall down if you continue to  [fm1,-] stramp your feet with so much force on it. In  [np6,1-0] evening, things are not better than  [np6,5-0] morning. You always turn on your H. F. to the highest volume and  [,0-1] I sure everyone on the neighbourhood knows you have owned a H. F. [fm2,-] The sharp, [sn9,-] noise  [fm1,-] ervades everywhere in our room, which [,9-11] is unable us to hear clearly the play in our own TV[sn8,s-]. Sometimes Your activities can even go late into night. All these bring much unhappy experience to us and also do great harm to our health. I hope the medical exam report of my grandma won't have  [fm1,-] may  [np6,3-0] problem, or I will phone the police and  [fm1,-] cal my lawyer to handle this business.                                        Your angry neighbour                                                       Mrs  [fm3,-] john Friends I  [fm3,-] have  [fm3,-] had Friends I have had can be generally classified to two types:  [fm3,-] One is the type I need most when I am in a good mood. [sn9,-]  [fm3,-] The other one is needed when I am in trouble, feeling frustrated, deflated or I have something that has to be confided. Usually, friends of the first kind are those who have fairly cheerful, lively,  [wd4,4-2]  [fm1,-] socialable personality. They are good at  [vp2,4-1] making fun,  [vp2,0-1] playing joke and creating humorous and happy atmosphere. On  [fm1,-] weekens, I usually go to movies or to karaoke  [np6,6-3] bar with such people and always come back with excited and delightful  [np6,4-0] feeling. Especially, [fm2,-] when I am going to have a birthday party, these friends become very essential. They are the most dynamic elements in the party, enlivening the atmosphere with all their capabitities [fm1,-]. They are shuttling here and there among the crowd, like butterflies or little rats, dallying with people, [fm2,-] making faces, talking nonsense in order to make others laugh. Sometimes they hehave [fm1,-] like a fool or a clown and never  [wd7,4-7] cure what the other people think of them. They make everyone feel relaxed and happy, without any doubt, having people like them, [sn9,-] [fm3,-] parties often end up with quite a success. However, friends of the second type are very sentimental. [sn9,-] patient and warm-hearted people. They do not like talking too much and always seem to be sunk into deep reverie whenever you meet them. But they are surely good listeners and worth of full trust. Once I was treated unfairly by a person and felt very annoyed, wanting to blow off the steam. I told the whole thing to my friend. Heating[wd3,3-3] my long, breakless [fm1,-] complaint, she looked even more furious than I,  [fm1,-] cletching her fist and teeth,  [wd7,5-4] curing with all  her strenth [fm1,-] "Really a bad egg! A  [wd2,1-1] damn egg!" At that time I was rather confused, for I couldn't make clear whether the fellow who offended me was the [fm1,-] enimy of her or mine. We both sat there [wd4,4-2]  kept cursing until my tougue [fm1,-] was tied. After that I felt quite comfortable and to a certain extent, a sense of victory. Surprisingly, the feeling of angry[wd2,3-2]  went away. Friends of the second type not only can share your angry[wd2,2-0] but also your sadness. If I tell a sad story of me to them, [fm2,-] usually, their tears have already fallen down even before I have enough time to concentrate all my strenth to produce some. They listen to you and never lose patience until you feel better. [fm2,-] They are the people who are worth of my respect and faith. I love my friends of the first kind, for they bring me much happiness. But I love friends of the second kind [fm1,-] mush more, for they are my really reliable good companions.

The noise coming from your house day and night  [wd7,9-5] twins my life into a disaster, [sn9,-]  I could no  [fm1,-] linger keep pace with a regular  [fm1,-] routin both during the daytime and at night . [fm3,-] this wears my patience away and finally drives me to ask you to have mercy upon my weak nerve! Each morning when I wake up, my eyes were swelling and red, [sn9,-]  [fm3,-] this was[wd5,-] became the noise ,which was so loud and piercing that could drive people crazy,  [,4-8] floating out of your windows a hole night long.  [,0-15] People upstairs  [fm1,-] where laughing, chatting, even shouting, in addition  [wd4,2-3] the sounds of throwing ards [wd7,-] and mixing . [fm3,-]  [fm1,-] he Majiang on a table were also clear. In the  [wd7,2-2] titlner of night, all  [fm1,-] there noises were serving  [fm1,-] an edles piercing through the ears and  [vp1,0-3] caned me  [wd3,2-3] feel tinnitus and headache in the daytime . What's more, your [wd7,1-2] addcition to singing has no  [fm1,-] night to  [vp4,1-2] made me  [vp1,2-3] suffering from no  [wd7,3-2] neat at noon [sn9,-]  I must say you couldn't deprive me of the last chance to have a sleep !  [fm3,-] why do you always play the Karo O.K.  [wd4,4-1] noon? Can you choose another time? Or if you do feel you can't live without singing. [sn9,-] [fm3,-] Could you please turn the voice a little bit down? To be honesty[wd2,2-0], [pr1,10- 7] it sounds just like wild shrieks and howls . Besides, you should pay more attention to your vulnerable throat !  [fm3,-] as I [fm1,-] ouldn't enjoy my precious rest at noon, I always feel sleepy, [sn9,-] [fm3,-]  [wd3,0-3] sometime I even doubt I have got neurostheria, [sn9,-]  [fm3,-] as you could easily see from my face , I'm not myself anymore! I hope this letter could  [vp4,1-1] drown some of your attention and the situation [,2-4] to be improved, even slightly. I'm looking forward with all my heart [wd4,7-3]  a quiet night, of[fm1,-] coarse, with your help. Friends I Have Had  [sn2,0-4] Two kinds of my friends: one is active and  [wd7,4-0] oacious, the other is quiet and withdrawn, who are seemingly  [wd7,3-1] throughout different, have accompanied me through my life from childhood till now. I like those people of sanguine disposition. They are always cheerful, preparing for any joke or mischief at  [fm1,-] ll time. They are out-going, never short of friends or companies.    [fm3,-] however what attracts me  [fm1,-] moat is their wisdom, [,0-9] no matter where out  [fm2,-] standing performance [wd3,2-3] ensures spoting them easily.  [sn9,-] because they are quick-witted, they are  [wd4,2-2] teacher's favorites and always the winners of any math-competitions. Dealing with such friends, you will be easily infected with their light hearts and humorous "remarks"-always  [fm1,-] mischivors  [fm1,-] bur not ill-willed-and you will be influenced unconsciously by their flexibility and elasticity, which  [vp3,4-6] is  [np6,5-5] a major  [np6,7-3] component of their  [fm1,-] haracteristics , and sub-consciously become more adaptable to  [wd4,2-1] new environment .  [fm3,-] to be short, those people  [vp3,2-3] makes you more active towards life. However, if I hadn't the other kind of friends, my life [fm1,-] woud have been incomplete and I myself  [vp7,2-0] [vp6, 9-1]  paralyzed. They are the friends talking with my deep heart, which is isolated from the reality and some time become my own voice. [sn1,s]They are always timid, sensitive and sentimental, [sn9,-]  [fm3,-] you could hardly predict  [,4-4] what is their intrinsic quality. They don't talk much, [sn9,-] they only like to listen. [sn1,s]Through their eyes, you know they care about you,despite the indifference shown on their faces. They look like ice, but inside they are fine, burning silently and  [fm1,-] ometimes, when you reach their heart, this fine [wd4,2-3]  will warm you and light your eyes. When I think about my friends,I think of myself. Since friends are always a mirror of your life.  [sn2,0-11] Two schools during my middle-school study, I have changed  [np7,3-3] the school 3  [wd3,3-0] time. Among them, two impressed me deeply. One is an  [fm1,-] xperimental school in a coastal area, the other is in my  [fm1,-] ometown, which is isolated from the outside by  [wd4,1-2] range of mountains. The experimental school is a fairly large one and modern one in content [wd3,s-] with my hometown school. It has more than 1,000 students and teachers, the school buildings are six-floored, which is rare for  [np7,4-2] the ordinary middle-school, and it has a standard sports ground which is covered with sand around and well-cut grass in the centre. [sn1,s][vp5,0-8] Comparing with it, the ground of my hometown school, which is only covered with mud and weeds and becomes  [wd7,10-3] disabled in rainy season simply becomes a play [fm2,-] ground for children to ride bikes or playing kites in the spring.          All the equipments [fm1,-] and facilities of the experimental school are newly bought or established. That [wd7,-] became it's a newly set-up school with a history of less than 15 years. It was set up during Han Dynasty by a county official and now becomes one of the key schools in our province. >From its buildings, which are covered with red and green stones located in the garden, which are enclosed with the dates and events happened down the history as a monument to the school,[sn8,s] you will have no surprise to hear that it was appointed by the state government as a historical preservation unit. The experimental school, since located in the coastal area,[sn2,s] [cc3,9-2] recieves [cc3,-2]much influence from overseas[sn9,-] adapts an open  [fm1,-] teaching-mathed [fm1,-], that is, to put more emphasis on the student's ability in performing well not only from an acdemic [fm1,-] angle, but also from the moral, physical and artistical [fm1,-] point of view. Besides this, they also exchange students and teachers with its counterparts abroad and often bolds discussions even debates among students, [sn9,-]  [fm3,-] by this means, students are supposed to develop comprehensively. In comparison with it, the hometown school still concentrates on the traditional teaching method--- teacher- centrism, [sn9,-]  [fm3,-] among those classes at different  [np6,5-3] grade, you can find their curricula are fully arranged, [sn9,-] [fm3,-] there's no spare time left for students to learn by themselves, not mention[wd3,-] the time [wd7,3-5] prepared for them to practise computers, work out the model airplanes or play the musical instruments as their [fm1,-] connterparts in the experimental school do. It's obvious that both teachers and students are aiming at one thing: entering to  [np6,2-2] university or colleges, as their ultimate purpose!

<ST 5> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GUFSED> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC ?> <TYP 2>??? There are three dishes and one pot of soup on the rectangular table. All of them are set in a diamond shape. The soup is on the most right point. It consists of vegetable and shelled shrimps. On the left tip [wd3,-s]  locates [wd2,-s]  one shallow plate of steamed fish slice, with hot pickled mustard aber [fm1,-]  chips in it. Between the pot and the plate are the rest two dishes---fried twoel gourd and tomato salad. The fried towel gourd is placed in a rounded and laced plate, behind which is the salad in a shallow dish. There are three bowels [wd3,-s] , three spoons and three pairs of chopsticks on both sides of the dishes. Two sets of them are respectively placed in front of the soup and the fish. The rest set is behind the fish dish. All the spoons are put in the bowels [wd3,-s]  with handles rightwards. Each pair of chopsticks is placed closely on the bowel [wd3,-s]  pointing the upper left corner of the tabel. This picture shows a corner of a coal miner's room. Its left art is mostly in shadow but the bright daylight penetrates in rom [fm1,-] the right and pours freely on the floor and the wall. The floor is made of some roughly-pocessed [fm1,-]  wood [wd2,-1]  boards, which looks very stable. A rattan chair stands comfortably in the middle, facing frortward [fm1,-] slangingly [fm1,-] . It has two arms and a back with patterns in round and curved shape. Behind the chair is a worn-out wall, which is built of big and irregular-edged rocks. On its most left, places [vp7,-s] a piece of worn board, over which a long-hair[wd7,-] clean room leans quietly against the wall with a long handle sustaining the floor. On the direct top of the broom, some leaks tear the ceiling and make holes in it. Green moulds appear around them in the damp. Just beneath the holes, there is a big colorful piece of advertising picture on the wall behind the chair. It was divided into left and right parts by a big bottle of coca cola in the middle line with a noticing [wd2,1-2]  white board in the front, saying "Gift". On the left, two woman [np6, 1-1] graduates in Bachelor suits are smiling at the drink, pointing it with some rolled paper in the hand, who seem thankful for the drink. There is a line of caption under them: You can always shop to advantage at ... drug stone. On the right, is a cheerful old man. He is dressed like a Santa Claus with red coats long white moustache and beard and a big beer-belly. With his left hand skimbo[fm1,-], he holds a bottle of coca cola in the right hand and turns his head towards in the right hand and turns his head towards us, smiling. He seems to satisfy at "The pause that keeps you going." The words which appears between the highly-held hand and the cheerful face seem to have brought more vigour into this room which is now full of warmness and sounds of happy laughter.  In the picture, Gary Cooper is walking straight to us. I seem to hear the sound and feel the shake under the ground when his feet step down, wearing a pair of stiff black shoes. He is a well-built middle-aged man, about 6`2`` in height. He wears in pair [np2,1-3]  of black pants whose wide trouser legs wave with the wind like flags in triumphant return. Around his waist is a black broad leather belt attached with a pistol in a leather case on the right. On his upper part of body, he wears a clean white shirt with a lively black bow-tie round the collar. Outside the shirt is a tight black waiscoat [fm1,-]  sewed with smooth and soft material above which a silver watch chain swings between two buttons. But the most attractive thing is not those [pr3,-2]  smart dress but a star-shaped badge which is now shining under the bright sunlight. He has a tanned face with straight lines which make his face look tougher under the shadow of the high-topped and broad-brimmed black hat. Under the high nose sets a tightly-closed mouth with two thin lips, which shows great vigour and determination. His eyes are the last thing you may miss. They are not so big and bright, but can look into the depth of your body with majesty. This is a family in deep melancholy. Only three members are present--- the father of an iron gate which is closely netted inside. Being stopped by this merciless defence, these three people seem so helpless. The man with rumpled curly hair wears crumpled black clothes which are a bit old-fashioned. On his shoulder sits a little girl, about two years old. The other girl slouches on the right of her father, hands in pockets. Her bagged skirt and messy hair give people an uncomfortable impression. The mother is absent, which is probably the cause that keeps them in silence. However, those three pairs of eyes are all directed through the defence into the other side, something eager in them. The families appear a bit worried but patient as well. They seem somewhat hopeful but have to wait ilently [fm1,-] outside for this is the only thing they can do. My struggle for lunch usually begins at 11:45 when the class is over. As soon as we are dismissed, I pick up my bag which has lready [fm1,-] been prepared and hungry [wd7,-s] out the classroom. Five minutes later, I begin rustling in my dorm, preparing for lunch. I first run to the Washing Room to washing [vp5,1-]  my hands clean with soap, then wash my lunch-box with boiled water. Before setting out I open my drawer and pocket some meal tickets. In no while, I am walking on the road which is now packed with students and bicycles. At about 12:00, I reach the dining-hall and immediately join the long queue for rice. Most people remain [cc3,-2]  their discipline here and all I have to do is to wait patiently for my turn. But as soon as I step out [wd4,-]  the peaceful queue, I have to master [cc3,-2] all courage to control myself not to be push [vp7,2-3]  away by people around me. Bit by bit, I approach the window that sells other foods. I wedge in the crowds before it, call out the name of the food that I want [wd4,-s]  the worker, give him the meal tickets and get the dish. Then I must double my courage, turn around and force my way out. Now I have done it. "No pains, no gains." Comforting myself, I set down in a corner of the hall and begin to enjoy my lunch. At about 6:05 p.m. I got on the last bus that day a bit earlier than usual, but still found it packed with people. Fortunately, there was a little space in front of the bar which was used to separate the carriage and the driver's cab. A middle-aged woman with a pair of black-brimmed glasses was starting on the left nd [fm1,-], her left hand holding the bar, her head turning aside talking, in a graceful manner, with a young man behind. As I wedged myself on the right side of her, she stopped herself mmediately [fm1,-]. She stared at me in silence, but I could see her eavy-mode-up [fm2,-]  black eyebrows being raised little by ittle [fm1,-] and her thick lens glittering at me. I did not realize what had happened until she suddenly covered her mouth closely with the other hand, seeming to prevend [fm1,-]  some mysterious thing from dripping out. She was angry [aj2,2-2]  about me, but I had to stand there only to receive those forceful soundless blames. The bus was jolting on the road which was being widened when the woman beside me gave me a violent push and began to turn slowly around her plump body in that tightly-fit suit. At the same time, she murmured in a low voice to herself and seemed to complain something about her feet. Not until then did I notice that she was only centering one leg to support her whole heavy body! She kept twisting her body in the crowd and struggling for more space for her own in all directions. I admired her strength so much for she managed to push me into the packed crowd behind which made me hold my own only with three fingers on the bar, and she aggressively occupied my former space with two thick arms sprawling, tightly grasping the bar. nstead [fm1,-] of the former graceful talking manner, she posted herself like a powerful boxer, who was ready to fight. I would like to do business in Guangzhou or join some trade [wd2,-1]  company when I graduate because I think Guangzhou is a city full of vitality and many opportunities which can be equally offered to anyone if he is quick-witted and able to bear hardships. I know a man running the passenger transport business. He was merely a young chap without a penny to his name when he first stood in the bustling downtown of Guangzhou and got dizzed [fm1,-]  about it. Being loyal to friends, he made more and more friends and remained good relationships with some related companies. With all these friends' support, he became the deputy of one company, responsible for selling tickets of passenger transport. The work was not so smooth at the beginning because of intense competition. Later, he succeeded for his good fame. Then he contracted to do the passenger transport business and took over the management by himself. This more arduous work required more wit, more courage and more perseverance. Nobody knew exactly how much he had suffered, endured and overcome, but everybody sees that now, after a few yours [wd3,3-] , he owned several buses which make up a transport team, and at the same time, a super fashion clothes, [sn9,-]  stored [wd2,4-5]  run by him is opened too. evidently [fm3,-] , he has achieved a great deal as [wd3,0-1]  for his own individuality. The city has provided things for all he had paid. So I believe it is a suitable place for doing business. Dear Sir, I wander [wd3,-s]  whether you have heard [vp6,2-5]  from me three months before, but one thing is sure, that is, I am suffering even more from the noise in your room which has severely disturbed my routine life. I am a deep slumberer [fm2,-] while I am often waken [vp7,3-7]  up [wd5,4-6]  in great panic by a Peny [wd7,-] on your floor at 2 o'clock in the morning. The worse thing is, for these few weeks it turns successive for minutes! If you are unable to stop it, the result will be unserable [fm1,-] . Another one is the noise when cutting the wood with electricity. It has screamed for several days from 9 am. till evening which exhausts me and dispels [cc3,-4]  my connection on writing. If you have hired a " productive" robot to do the job, I must say " congratulations", but now I can been[fm1,-] no more the crazy noise. If I am not mad, it must be your robot who is unsane. Perhaps we can resort to the landlord to sent him away? Two different features of [wd4,4-4]  cities I have visited give me quite different but the same well [ad2,2-1]  impressions. Guilin and Xiamen are both characterized by splendid natural scenery, while Shenzhen and Haikou are characterized by wonderful structure. Natural scenery features in Guilin and Xiamen, which everyone can feel at the first sight of the land. The green Lijing River gently flows across the city, narrowed by fantastically-shaped hills and stock [wd3,5-3]  on either bank [sn9,-]  which lead one into wild maginations [np5,0-] . Blue wave, while[fm1,-] sand, green trees, old-fashioned villas and wonderful piano tunes make up the charm of Gulang Yu in Xiamen which guides one into a quiet and romantic secluded life. Modern diversity belongs to Shenzhen and Hai kou [fm2,-]  who are newly developed with the implementation of [wd4,3-2]  opening policy more than a decade ago and are opened towards high technology and modern science. When wandering on the streets, one feels surrounded by intelligent artificial works. Buildings soaring up into the sky, decorated with colour [wd2,2-1]  signboards and shaped like supermen, impress you with power, vitality and efficiency. The bright color and imaginative shape fills you with energy and enthusiasm adapted [,-s]  to fast steps of urban life. These two different features, no matter old-fashioned or modern, no matter natural or artificial, both show me the diversity of life. So much do they impress me that I would rather keep them as part of the everlasting memory. ne [fm1,-] friend of mine and I were graduates from two different iddle schools. As for the principles of teaching, they form a sharp contrast. In classes most of her teachers show distinct likes to excellent students and dislikes to " bad" students. They lways [fm1,-] ask the former ones questions with smile and then can't help praising them while seldom pay attention to the latter ones even if those students get the right answer, which always frustrates the backward students. in [fm3,-]  contrast, most of my teachers treat students equally. There exists no pride and prejudice. Every student has an equal chance in no matter raising questions r expressing his own opinion freely. No matter from whom, each question will be answered seriously and each solution, if it is convincing, will be accepted. This principle motivates students and makes them more competitive. After class, excellent students receive more chances than others in improving abilities. No matter whether they have the talent in the aspect, teachers like to see their "preference" in the competition's list and push them on, train them and let them take part in various contents and require them to bring back honours. All these chances scarcely fall on other ordinary students who eventually come to be bored of all these tricks. But in my school, chances can fall on any student who interests [wd2,3-3]  in some aspect and turn him into a competitor under the same competitive rule. One student may join any interest group he likes even though he is not a "good" student. For the ability is considered the most important factor, not a high mark in routine study instead. In my friend's school, the principle of teaching can cultivate several talented persons while in my school, it can forster [fm1,-] a group. CECL aims at training students' comprehensive skills, including listening, reading, speaking and writing. It seems to have methods rich enough in motivating students, but it may fail if students don't cooperate. In a word, how to learn CECL mainly means how to cooperate actively with the teacher. Before ttending [fm1,-] the class, prepare the text by consulting dictionaries for key new words listed by the teacher beforehand, and skimming the text through so as to make a general impression about [pp1,4-2]  its content and composition. When having a CECL class, a student has to know how to learn by himself. The teacher plays no doubt a certain role, but his main task is to act as an observer, or an instructor, at the very most, who can not replace the student himself and finish the process of cognition for him. So the student himself is the main body in how to learn CECL. More flexibility, more vigorous creativity and more initiative are required. To raise questions in mind and manage to solve it after reading is much better than glancing the material through and sitting back and waiting for the teacher's explanation. Theoretically, we train our communicative skill in class mainly by getting through with large quantities of exercises involving the truest native materials. However, this doesn't mean that we should focus on their grammar, phonetics or word-formation, etc. People apply to [wd5,1-8]  the communicative skill to the exchange of information. On the contrary, we can strengthen our communicative skill by obtaining and passing information to form the understanding between two parts. In addition, a student in CECL is required to have the most natural manner. It can mostly be explained as focusing on fluency rather than on accuracy. Once a student is confined to the principle of accuracy, he can never express himself clearly and communicative smoothly. The process of courting accuracy is a long and hard process of deep thought. Even if he was able to reach that goal, he would probably have lost his fluency for decades. That is why we stress fluency nstead [fm1,-] of accuracy and we are sure our emphasis does accelerate he process in improving accuracy. The words above are some of my own experience and I hope they can give you a clearer impression on how to learn CECL. "A friend is a person one knows and likes, but who is not a elation." Says a dictionary, but my views of 'friend" have more variety. In my childhood, a friend is my little partner skillful in rubber band skipping. However, before I knew how to skip the rubber band, I had long approved of my elder sister's being my friend--- when I was driven back from kindergarten every weekend, the first sight of her, standing under a tall banyan and waving her hand excitedly to me beside the road, always injected a feeling of pain into my innocent heart, like an unexpected gale sweeping across a tranquil wheat field. I had been missing her so much! After I graduated from junior school and separated from my best friend, I once had an impulse to write to her, telling her about my new school life and new classmates. She is the first person I can think of when I am in the mood for pouring out my heart. When a passenger-by offers to care about you, your happiness and health in the place of your parents when they can not accompany you on your arduous trip, you come across a friend. He is the voluntary helper who willingly installs [cc3,-5]  his spare-time on your car breaking down on the way. A friend is a sharer while a sharer is not certain to be a friend. If I have the only-left chocolate in my pocket, I would like to cut it into halves and chew satisfyingly with the same [wd7,2-2]  hungry friend. I will never share the sweetness with an enemy who is greedy and violent. When one needs a friend, it [,0-3]  is no need to search him up and down. If you are not too arrogant, you will likely find him among the noisy crowd because he is the one stands by you and supports you.   hen one is enjoying friendship, he is probably the happiest person in the world. Friendship is often sweeter than marriage because it has freedom and you are always yourself that no one can change. Henry Adams says, " Friendship needs ... a community of thought." When you communicate with a person and find that word sometimes seems redundant, he is the friend you are looking forward to, because at that moment you are " one soul abiding in two bodies". To me, a friend always brings a feeling which comforts me. Thus I can't help thanking God's generosity for arranging the date between my friend and I occasionally which has bestowed a splendid colour on my life's trip. I forced my way in the crowd, my friend following. " How much is the watermelon per jin?" I inquired of the proprietress hustling her goods to the customers huddling beside her. "One yuan and thirty cents," replied the proprietress. " why [fm3,-] , it is so expensive!" my friend couldn't help screaming up behind me. " t's not [wd4,-s]  all. I assure you they will taste very sweet." The proprietress explained hastily and immediately picked out a big watermelon floating in a waterful [fm1,-] bucket. It seemed quite nice. When I looking [vp4,2-4]  at the dripping water, some greedy worm secretly crept in my mind and made me as uncomfortable as that greedy Hackleberry [fm1,-] Finn staring at the watermelon which was used to save Jim and couldn't be eaten. Just at that moment, I made up my mind to get a good bargin [fm1,-]. A trick sparkled. "well [fm3,-] ," I said, " in the neighbouring store it costs only one yuan per jin. Your price is much too high." " Theirs can not match mine," the roprietress [fm1,-] seemed a bit worried and tried not to lose her potential customers. "You can also buy it for the price here..." A bit of compromise was shown. I turned my head aside and blinked at my friend, who had already seen my trick through and was so making efforts to hold back her laugh with her hand pressing on her mouth. ut not before I stood calm upon my peak n Darien, the proprietress added that we should have to select one by ourselves. Both of us stored [wd3,3-2]  there dumbfounded at the words for none of us had even the least knowledge of choosing a nice watermelon. But all at once, another whim came upon me like all whims came upon Hack. "OK," I responded confidentially [wd3,-s] . " I'll pick one out by myself. " Then I pointed to that watermelon in the storekeeper's hand and told her that was exactly the one of my choice. She was dazed for half a minute at my words before she realized what I meant and immediately she turned  around, staring at me, and exclaimed that it was absolutely unworkable. My friend and I couldn't bear any longer at the moment and burst out laughing simultaneously. " I did wish Tom Sawyer was there, I knowed [fm2,-]  he would take an interest in this kind of business, and throws [vp9,11-4]  in the fancy touches," I thought aloud no Huck [wd7,-s].
 
<ST 5> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GUFSED> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC ? > <TYP 2>?? Dear sir, We live right under your apartment and I take the liberty of informing you that since the floors and walls of this building are badly insulated, we are constantly being disturbed by the noises coming from you apartment. It seems you get up much earlier than us since I am usually awaken [vp7,3-4]  by the news broad-casting or warming up dance music crashing on me from above. I can't fall asleep again with your sudden calls to your wife " Dear Jane" or to your son " My little dog, bird, pig" or whatever. As a sports fan, I quite appreciate your ferver [fm1,-]  on sports. But may I suggest you take more riding, jogging or outdoor excursion to substitute the indoors boxing. You may change your boxing court with your son from the bedroom to the park, for the "Pong! "s of your son's dropping are really heartbreaking. If my wife hadn't a heart disease, I wouldn't have mentioned this. Nights are the most difficult time, especially when you hold a party. Your joyful " Hello, Billy!" "Hello, Joe!"; the loud music; Billy's typically gingling [fm1,-] laughter; sound of feet stamping on the floor to follow the rock'en'roll rhythim [fm1,-] .... All [fm3,-]  crash on us and don't disappear untill [fm1,-] it's 2 or 3 hours before I should get up. So, would you please make less noise from today on, when you eceive [fm1,-] this bold letter? We'll be greatly thankful if you do so. Yours faithfully, om. Generally speaking, the cities I've visited can be divided into 3 types: tourist, industrial and political. Tourist cities always have beautiful scenery or historical relics, they're colored by local culture and customs. Hangzhou, Su zhou, Chengdi, Guilin are of this type. In such cities, we receive visual and taste [sn6,2-1]  pleasure. The architecture, the gardens, ancient relics on display, the amazing water and mountains ... all keep you delightful [wd3,2-]  and curious all the time, and the street snacks, such as pancacks [fm1,-], small steam buns in Huang zhou [fm2,-] , rice noodles in Gui lin [fm2,-] ... all make your mouth watering. Changsha, Shenyang, Guangzhou are f the second type: the industrial cities, in such places, you've got the most chances to see skyscrapers, flyovers, Ads for heavey [fm1,-] or light industrial products, you see factories now and then on your way round the city. There are not so many strangers as in the tourist cities. The local people lead a more regular and quicker life to promote the economic development. The third type; [sn9,-] the political center is exclusive for the chinese [fm3,-]  capital---Beijing. In Beijing, everybody is solemn, orderly and offical [fm1,-] . But it is also the iggest [fm1,-] tourist city. But still it is very much political-colored [fm2,-]  in the tourists-must-goes, because most of the places are in connection with emperors or Queens in Ming and Qing dynasties. " Power" is a very significant word in this political city, showing the policy of the country, showing the control over the complex contradictions and the confidence to make our country even better. I remember there is a restaurants in my hometown quite resembling the one in [wd3,-2]  our campus, as the layouts are concerned. Firstly, the one [wd4,2-2]  my hometown is a two-story building with large windows. Similarly the one on our campus--- let's call it campus restaurant--- has two stories and large windows of dark glasses. Neither of them use both stories for money- profiting purpose. The home-restaurant, as well as the campus-restaurant has its count-desk on the second floor, while the floor serves as a canteen, where the staff go and have a reasonable- price meal, using tickets instead of cash. Both restaurants have many rectangular tables on the first floor so that the staff can sit. The firsat [fm1,-]  floor serves for the welfare of people. Secondly, when you enter the second floor of either restaurant, you will immediately recall the other one, because they have almost the same design. The home-restaurant has kitchen in the left- front part. Similarly, the campus restaurant has it there oo [fm1,-]. The home- restaurant looks as orderly as the campus one due to the concentric- circle- shape placed tables. Because the walls of both restaurants are almost devoved [fm1,-]  by the windows, such [wd4,-6]  kind of arrangement for the tables can enable most of the customers to have a good view of the outside scenery. Have a cup of tea in either restaurant, and you'll feel the same pleasure. CECL CLASS CECL ( Communicative English for English Learners) needs some prepare [wd2,3-] . Before the class begins, you should have already gone over the list for new words and expression for the subject to be dealt with in class, for example, education, health, cusine [fm1,-], religion, etc. Thus you have a general idea on the subject. Class begins with warming-up exercises, which includes listening, direction [wd3,-s]  or a short report to the teacher of what happened yesterday. Then reading follows ---- In [fm3,-]  the CECL book, many articles are included for one subject. Some and [fm1,-]  for intensive reading and some are just for skimming or skinning [fm1,-] -you read the articles which the teacher points out and think about it while reading. When all students finish the articles, they are devided [wd5,2-2]  into several groups to discuss on [wd5, 1-2]  the articles they just read or anything about the subject you're dealing with for today's CECL class. One student will be responsible to report to the whole class the conclusion of their group's discussion, and there will be argument and seven debate [np6,1-] between the groups. The teacher will stop the students at proper moment and the class settle down for listening. Listening materials are closely related to the previous discussion; everyone is supposed to listen carefully and get the gist the first time and specific details the second time. If necessary, a third time listening is done to get better comprehension. After listening is some more reading. Such articles may be more profound and gramatical [fm1,-] explaination [fm1, -]  by the teacher is expected. The class may end in some more discussion, some more interesting materials or some writing. Writing is still on the dealt subject, giving students' opinions or experiences. Usually 2 or 3 classes we needed for one subject, [sn9,-] [sn8,s]call one unit. CECL is based on a subject- division system. Boredom Men having [vp4,-s]  been suffering boredom ever since they learnt to think. It causes mischief and destrustion and it is socially very expensive. he dictionary has dicribed [fm1,-]  "boredom" as "state of feeling tired by being dull or tedious" which emphsize [fm1,-] [wd4,-3]   the objective elements and its influence upon people. While Esteller, [sn9,-]  Ramey defines it as "a grossly underestimated malady". This definition seems giving [vp5,3-5]  us a more subjective picture of a bored man, i. e. boredom is considered a disease which manipulates a person's action, internally. But in my point of view, " Boredom" means " Emptiness in mind". If one has got thoughts, nothing could bore him, whethor [fm1,-]  internally or externally, while emptiness produces no hope, no desire to act or change, so it inevitablly [fm1,-] leads to boredom. The famous paorter [fm1,-]  Vangue had spent years in a lonely island Tahiti, painting. He painted and painted, living a simply [wd2,2-1]  life. But not only didn't he feel bored, but also he was vigorous and contemplative all the time. That's what a [np7,-2]empty man cannot understand or cannot do. Despite all the variations for the difinition [fm1,-]  of the word, the recipe is the same; to enrich the mind. The heavy snow forced me into the bar to find a shelter. There were a lot of people, drunk or drowsy or laughing or gingling [fm1,-] in the warmth of the stove. I found a seat opposite a huge, bearded man and sat down. He looked at me, showing me his bottle of alcohol: "Wonna drink? " I said no and thanked him. He smiled with obvious contempt and added: "Twenties?" My brain reeled. It was a chance to lie a little, which was my hobby when I met strangers. "Thirty-one, and with my wife, she's carrying a baby. " I really looked much older than I actually was. "You did! So you're married! What a damned disgusting thing! So you married her, [sn9,-]  you married a nothing but trouble!" I couldn't help laughing and said " Do you know my wife?" "No. No. But she is nothing but trouble!" I laughed. "So you are not angry. You lied, didn't you? You are ot married, even have no girlfriend." He said in an [np7,-2]  questioning way. " You're right. I lied. " " So you don't know the thing, you can laugh." He looked away from me in a weakening voice. " You are still young and you are yourself." "Aren't you still young and aren't you yourself?" I asked in a joking manner. He didn't reply, [sn9,-]  didn't give me a glimpse. He poured cups after cups of alcohol and drank them. "You know,' he finially [fm1,-]  continued [sn9,-]  " The problem is, [sn9,-]  'How [fm3,-]  you love'. [sn9,-] No, not that, actually, [sn9,-]  ' Are you in love'. " "Tell me your story, then." " No. I won't. It's not interesting to listen." " She died with a broken heart. I'm dying with a broken heart." "What do you mean? She killed herself?" He kept silent. After a while, he stood up, peering into the heavy snow outside, " Don't ask anymore, [sn9,-]  I feel guilty. " He stepped out, leaving me there, never figuring out his story. Whenever I recall this now, I can't help wondering how is his life these days [,-s]. 

<ST 5> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GUFSED> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC ? > <TYP 2>??? ear [fm1,-] Sir, I am your neighbour who is living in the apartment of the 2nd loor [fm1,-] which is just below yours. I am sorry to write to tell you that the great noise at all hours from your apartment has been giving me some inconvenience. In the morning, I am usually woke [vp7,3-5]  up by your alarm clock at about 7: 00 which is two hours ahead o f my departure time. I am sorry to find that I could no longer go to sleep during those two hours because you step so heavily on the floor and now and then knock down some pots or bowls on the floor, this making me nervous.[sn8,s] After a long day's tiring work in the office, I am always welcomed home by the pop singers' beating songs from your CD player. I do appreciate your beautiful CDs, but I am afraid it is a little hard for me to accept those bombing drums for 4 hours. Continually, when my nerve has a short rest with your music urned [fm1,-] down, then come your energetic friends. They are so lovely and active that their uncontrolled laughter and cry nearly make e envy, for I really wish I were as young as you. But, since I am no longer young, I hope the life to be a little quieter. Would you please give me this pleasure? I will be so greatful [fm1,-]. Yours faithfully, Cen. Friends Friends are great treasure to me, whether they are older than me, of me [pr4,1-2]  same age or much younger than me. They bring me into a world full of color, showing me the unknown and accompaning [fm1,-] me to taste the happiness and bitterness. Though not many older friends I have made, they play rather an important role in my life. Those wonderful people, who have experienced so much happiness and suffering, usually like to give me advice bout how to deal with my life. Their soothing remarks are so convincing that they help me over come the difficulties again and again. Like the breeze in the garden [wd4,6-1]  autumn, they make me feel so comfortable. hough [fm1,-] not so experienced as the old, those friends of my same age are great pleasure to me. They offer company whenever and wherever I am. We go to see Vivien Lee. We discuss love and death. We are worried about the corruption. My beloved friends are sunshine in my life. Apart from those mentioned above, I also have some friends who are much younger than me. They may not understand what I am thinking of, but their innocent eyes tell me how to love the nature and the world. Playing with them reminds me of something I have nearly forgotten: the beauty of the grass leaves, the games played between the chickens and the sympathetic heart one should not throw away. Those are my friends. They are an unalienable part of my life. I will not change them for anything. Guang zhou [fm2,-]  Institute of Foreign Languages and Zhong shan University are two of the important tertial [fm1,-]  institutes in Guang dong [fm2,-]  province. ZU provides a picture of one " more like a university", i.e. life in ZU is more interesting and colorful. ZU is much bigger than GIFL and therefore provides the students with a more flexible and colurful enviomment [fm1,-] , GIFL is a specialized institute of languages and all of the departments in it [wd4,5-2]  concerned with linguistics. ZU, on the other hand, is a comprehensive university with more department dealing with various subjects. As a result, there are a large number and more kinds of students n ZU than in GIFL. With its larger population and capacity, ZU sees a more exciting life while the life in IFL is quiet. Compared [sn2,s-]  to the students in GIFL is quiet. Compared to the students in GIFL, those in ZU enjoy Luxunous [fm1,-] [fm3,-]   facilities. They spend their space [fm1,-]  time on the standard tennis court, while students in GIFL have their long-distance running-test on the path covered with cement. Since ZU derives its name from the famous and respectful statesman, many groups and individuals are willing to give lecture and performance which offer the students more entertainment and education. In contrast to ZU, GIFL is far away from downtown and it is not attractive to those influential persons. So the students have to learn to entertain themselves. Students in ZU as a whole are active. However, those in GIFL are to some extent passive. Students in ZU have more chances to train themselves by taking part in different contents [wd3,14-] ,mini-stock- exchange and Mileseven advertisement group, while those in GIFL concentrate on study and are used to occupying themselves with reading. CECL (Communicative English for Chinese Learners) class is quite different from the traditional English class. It involves the 4 basic skills --- listening, speaking, reading and writing in the same class. And it is an effective way to arouse the initiatives of the students and it shows a new picture of learning a language. Compared with the traditional reading class, CECL requires fewer preparations. A CECL book is divided into several units and each unit deals with a certain topic such as food, health, economy, envionment [fm1,-] . Thus each unit has a limited and special vocabulary connected with that topic, which is given to you before the class. So looking up in the dictionary and remembering the words are the main tasks in your preparations. After that, it would be much better if you can get some relevant materials for background knowledge. But remember that you do not have to read the text before hand [fm2,-]  unless the teacher asks you to do [wd5,-s] . Having a CECL class means you have no time to think of or do other irrelevant things. Maybe during a traditional class you are now and then bored by the dats [fm1,-]  of birth and death of Hemingway, or the so-called romantic story about  or the styles of Henry James which are told by the teachers standing on the platform. But in a CECL class, you are two [fm1,-]  busy to feel bored. Before the class is started [vp7,4-] , you have to have everything prepared: book, exercises book, pen, dictionary and earphone. Then during the following time, you are engaged in listening to the tape in which the differences of food are discussed, in giving a brief speech to your classmates about how to cook a fish, or in reading a passage dealing with the translation of a manu [fm1,-] . You are occupied by so many activities that you find the class is [wd5,-s]  unexpectedly short. The most mportant [fm1,-] thing is that you really know something about food and master skills which may be employed in future. After class, it seems that CECL leaves you little to review, [sn9,-]  on the contrary, it leaves you much time to do a lot of self-studying to make up for what you can not learn in the course. On the whole, CECL uses various means to cultivate your interest in what you are learning and it provides you with novelty and pleasure in studying. What is boredom? When you wake up in [wd3,-3]  a Sunday morning and go across the room to turn on the TV and then have nothing else to do, you know it. When a friend calls on you the third time this week and keeps telling you his tedious wife and his cat, you taste it. when [fm3,-]  you go to work at 9:00 a.m. and come home at 5:00 p.m. day after day, you feel it. So, boredom is a feeling almost eryone [fm1,-] will experience now and then. It is the state of feeling tired and uninterested by something dull. You hate it but it seems impossible, or difficult to get rid of it. boredom [fm3,-]  is something choked in your throat but you can not force it out, which makes you very uncomfortable. Once you encounter boredom, you are apt to have no strength in you and want to be lazy. The world around you is grey and something you respect and have struggled for becomes meaningless. You move a chair to the door and sit down and stare at the sky, waiting for the end of the day, of the moon, of the year. If this is the case for you, you are very fortunate. Boredom sometimes causes people to resort to drug and violence. They hope that the bills [wd3,-s]  could help them out and make them feel high. And since boredom is something you can not speak out, some people find that hitting somebody or something is a way to relieve which [pr5,-s]  is likely to bring catastrohpic [fm1,-] results. But what should we do with boredom? I think occupying yourself with something in which you are interested is one of the answer [np6,3-]  to cultivate some interests like collecting stamps, reading, raising animals and flowers is wholesome to men. Whenever you feel Mr. Boredom is coming, take up your favorite book or throw yourself in your collection of various small stones to counter him, which is to be of, at least, a little use. An other [fm2,-]  way is to find some time for yourself to go away from the routine to gasp [wd3,-3]  some fresh air. It is a technique of living. And there is a last thing I would like to advise: considering it is so hard for yourself to get rid of the boredom brought by Mr. Smith's repeating stories, try not to bring boredom to others. The black clouds were now spreading quickly and in a while, I felt the rain drops alighting on my head, on my nose. "Damn it!" I kept cursing and ran to find a shelter in front of a store. here had been some people standing there. I was hurrying back home to watch a film on TV which I had eagerly waited for a long time. But this damned rain! I was murmuring my complaints when I heard the song of " Rain keeps falling on my head" whose heerful [fm1,-] melody sounded ironic to me. I turned to it nd [fm1,-] find that the girl right beside me was leaning on her bicycle, humming the tune with the foot beating time. Noticing that I was staring at her, she gave me a bright smile and said: " It is really heavy, isn't it?" "Yes, [sn9,-]  How disgusting." I hated her pleasant tone. "Well, you seems a little angry. I suppose it is because of the rain?" she paused, receiving no response, and continued: " I know it is not my business. But really it is no use. It keeps pauling [fm1,-] no matter how angry you are. Since you can not change it, who [wd4,-s]  not accept it?" " Why should I?" my disliking as obvious." Girls of today are becoming terribly daring and inquisitive." I said to myself. "Haven't you heard of the wonderful advise which says: ' If you can not beat it, join it? '" "No, I am not that kind of man." I myself was a little astonished by the contemptuousness in the remard [fm1,-] . " No, you are not, " Her pleasure had not changed. " But if you don't like to be 'mired', you can still wait. ' If the winter has came [vp9,4-] ,would the spring be far away?'" "You appear to be very poetic.' I said, with the satire plunged in against my will. "No, Poets are too sensitive and easy to be hurt. Even the breeze, the rain could make them cry. By the way, you are a little similar to them in this respect." She intended to keep back her smile but failed. So did I . My irritation could not withstand the sunshine on her facr [fm1,-]. "O-oh, the sun comes out." She was mocking at me. In fact it had not yet. But it was going to, wasn't it? I turned my eyes to the rain with a light heart.

Buck the [fm3,-] National Travelling Limite [fm1,-]  of China 99 Tianhe Road Guangzhou, Guangdong  Dear Mr Buck,    With[pp2,-2] the reference to  your advertisement in the Yangchang Daily of October 13rd [fm2,-] , 1997, I'm writing to apply for a guiding [wd3,1-1]  job in the national Travelling Limite [fm1,-]  of China.    As you will see from my C.V., I have a first degree in English from Zhongshan University, and have the license [wd3,-9] of passing the 8th scale [wd3,2-4]  of national English test.  I can speak both English and Chinese fluently, which I feel would be a great advantage for the work.     I suppose I could be the most qualified with [pp1,6-3]  the guiding [wd3,1-1]  position of the Three-sc [fm1,-]  line.  My hometown is [wd4,3-2]  Hubei province [fm3,-].  I have travelled this pot [wd3,4-2] several times and I'm most familiar with Wuhan city.    The experience of temporary working in the Travel   Part at school, I'm sure, be very relevant and useful to the  work. [sn8,s]     I have great enthusiasm  and confidence  with  this job.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.                                                                   Yours sincerely                                                                 Cathleen                                                                 Oct. 15th 1997

<ST 5><SEX 2><Y 8><SCH Zhongda><AGE 18><WAY 1><DIC 1><TYP 1>                                                                         Please think over the details of the three evidences of the prosecutor.  Perhaps some puzzles would be up to you.[sn8,s]     Now let's analyze the three evidences [np6,-] more carefully and logically.    First, the testimony of the old man who lived just under the room where the murder took place. [sn2,s]  He said at ten minutes after twelve he heard loud noises sound [vp4,4-3]  like a fight and heard the kid said to his father, "I'm a  going to kill you."  Stop here.  Do you really think the boy would shout a thing like that so the whole neighbourhood could hear?  This is the first puzzle.  Then the old man said a second later he heard a body falling.  In 15 seconds he got out of bed, ran to the door and opened the door just seeing [vp5,14-5]  the kid beating it downstairs.  How could the old man who walks with two canes run? And how could he finish all the things -- get out of bed, run to the door, open the door only in 15 seconds?  This  is the second puzzle.    Second, the evidence of the woman across the street. [sn2,s]  She said she tossed and turned for over an hour, unable to sleep.  Finally she turned toward the window at about twelve ten.  As she looked out, she saw the boy stab his father.  The woman wears glasses.  She wouldn't wear her glasses in bed, would she? And the lights through the passing train went out a second later, [sn9,-]  It is sure she couldn't have had time to put on her glasses.  How could she see clearly?  Third puzzle.    Last, the cute little  switch knife with which the father was killed.  We could get many knives just the same as it in [wd4,1-3]  little junk shop around the corner from the boy's house.[sn,s].   Let's think over the whole business about the stab wound and how it was made.  The downward angle of it.  The boy is five feet eight inches tall.  His father was six two .  That's a difference of six inches.  It's very hard to stab down into the chest of someone who's taller than you are.  And one [wd3,-s]  who has ever had any experience with switch knives never have stabbed [vp6,s-]  downward.  He wouldn't  have made the kind of wound that killed his father.  It's the fourth puzzle.    Innocent until proven guilty. [sn2,s-]   How could you use such evidences with so many puzzles to prove [wd4,2-1]  guilty?  Never.  So the boy is innocent. 

< ST 5> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GDUFS> <AGE ?> <WAY ?> <DIC ?> <TYP 2>?? Dear Sir, I'm sorry but  [sn6,3-4] have to write to you, otherwise, I'll probably lose my hearing if your children continue leading a life in such a mess. I know that most of the months you're out on business, which  [cc5,1-6] leaves your home sometime like a battlefield, a sport field or a bar. Every morning, I'm waken up not by my alarm clock (I'm afraid its sound now is too weak for me), but by your children's quarreling ver [fm1,-]who should make break fast. [sn8,s]Usually the radio is turned on with some "bang" and crash sounds. It often [vp3,2-] last over an hour. Then, they start their morning boxing exercises instead of going to school. I should admit they're making progress, because I found more and more sands falling down from your balcony. Michael Jackson's pops [fm2,-]songs may be their favorite [sn9,-], they never forget to play it when they "fight".I feel ever [fm1,-]  terrible in the afternoon. Your kids choose the floor as a  skate [cc4,-]field. The wheels make a harsh sound killing my ears. With Michael Jackson or some heavy metal on the tape, they imitate their singing, shorting , jumping .I can only pray that the floor won't be broken.I'm afraid you know little about your kids.In the evening,  they seldom make  [np6,1-] noise, instead, I often hear some [np6,1-] scream or crying from the horror [wd2,0-2]  video tapes they play. Either a short [fm1,-]  of "Ghost" or "I'll call of you !" [sn8,s]make me tremlle [fm1,-]. Or the gunfire, or a savage laughter, [pr1,7-0] they arouse my imagination and I'm really living in a might  mare [fm1,-] [fm2,-]. Could you be so kind enough[wd5,2-] to spend a little more time at home and tell your kids to make less noise? I'll be very grateful if I can spend a day quietly. Yours, CLASSES I HAVE ATTENDED[sn9,-] Three kinds of classes I have attended make my way of taking classes changing from time to time. [sn8,s]There is a kind of  [np9,5-2] teachers who like to read what's on the text books. [pr1,10-1] He is too prudent to have his own opinion. When I attend [pr1,12-1]their classes, all I have to do is to take notice of where the teacher is reading and make a mark there. No note is necessary even though teachers [wd7,1-1] chink [fn2,-]oppositely. Also the whole class is rather  uiet[fm1,-]. All the students lower their heads, seemingly attentive to something. Some are reading novels, some are writing letters, some are even listening to walk  man[fm2,-], leaving the teacher by the platform practising [vp5,1-0] read-aloud. But another kind of class,not like the [wd7,1-2] fore said one, makes us dictating all the time. [sn8,s] The teacher finds some materials that we'll never find, then, read one sentence  by sentence to us. [sn8,s]We are kept writing like machines, occasionaly [fm1,-] [fm1,-][vp4,7-4] look up at the teacher with a begging expression, "Could you please slow down your reading?" Time  eems [fm1,-] to never pass normally in such kinds of classes. Of course, not all the classes I've attended are like that.  [vp1,0-20] There are still  [fm1,-] ome teachers both follow the text book and have their own opinions and most of all, let  us have time to  [vp4,5-2] think, to exchange ideas at class. Usually the atmosphere is warm.  [fm1,-] ome [fm2,-] times I take note of the information not in the text book, sometimes follow the teacher's instruction to think [sn8,s], to develop my opinion. Only at that time,[sn9,-] can I feel the art of teaching and experience the happiness of learning. This has been my impression on the classes I've attended in this institute and I wish I'll always have that last kind. TWO SCHOOLS [sn9,-] The first impress[fm1,-] on [pr5,2-6] that schools A and B give you are different stepping into school A,[sn8,s]you'll see a small garden with roses, camellias, cannas and other colorful flowers . But there's only a bituminous road between the schoolB's, [sn9,-]gate and the main teaching building -the 10-storey chemical Building. [fm1,-]long each side of the road is a line of Chinese parasols. The chemical Building is obviously newly built. From the board on the gate of the building, you can see it's onated [fm1,-]in 1992 by a well- off patriotic overseas Chinese[sn9,-] While over the garden, the main building in A--the English teaching building, was built 50 years ago, Some windows are broken, too. As you go further, you'll find that,  as a college, A is much smaller in size than B which is a university. Only two or three more teaching buildings are scattered around the main building of A, containing all the classrooms and offices for 4 departments. While in B, a single physics Department has 35-storey  [np1,2-3] buildings as regwlar[fm1,-] classrooms and a T-storey laboratory building. About 10 minutes' walk will be enough for you to get a general idea of A's layout. However, you can hardly make B's layout clear  if you have no bike and are not willing to spend at least half an hour. Another notable thing you may easily find is that there are much more girls in A than in B.  that [fm3,-] mainly  [sn2, 2-3] due to  [np9,2-2] that fact that A  [sn2,2-4] in a college of  languages and B is  [np3,2-1] science university. Both boys and girls choose what interests them  as their majors. In A, girls wearing beautiful clothes are walking on the campus practising oral English or, with a radio in hand [sn9,-] , listening to VOA'S special English. But it's a totally different picture in B--in dormitories, books everywhere, dirty clothes thrown on beds and socks under beds,  boys are sitting quietly at the desks, working on piles of assignments the professors have just assigned. [sn1,s]   Not like other major English courses like College English or Comprehensive English, CECL course is more vivid and effective for students' first  [np1,0-4] two years of basic training in colleges. Traditionally, students are faced with a long text with numerous new words and grammers [fm1,-]and they have to prepare a lot before the new  lesson: look up the new words  on[wd3,-] the dictionary, preview the text and so on. Words [sn9,-]  phrases and grammer[fm1,-] are the centre of their study. But   for CECL, there is  a specific topic for each unit, such as family,  to wris [fm1,-]and sport . Gcturally [fm1,-], there are few long passages or  [np6,4-2] text in CECL, but more listening ,speaking and writing exercises. So, to take a CECL class, students do not necessarily preview the text. The only thing they would do is to get their earphones ready . When the lesson begins, some simple questions related to the central topic are raised by  the teacher and [sn8,-s] comes a small warm  [fm2,-] up discussion .Usually there is an  [cc4,1-1] according [wd3,-]record by [np7,-]foreign expent [fm1,-]  or the same topic  [np6,0-5] student then listen to the tape, sometime take notes, to see how's the conversation going[sn8,s]. fter [fm1,-]  [fm3,-] that, the teacher helps  the student go through some specific terms for the unit. In sports, there will be the names of various sport games, rules, etc. For Tourism, there will be  [np7,3-5] the introduction of famous scenic spots in China and abroad.  In every unit, there are activities for students to act and talk. They are devided [fm1,-]into several groups and try [vp6,s-] their best to present vividly some situational dialogues to the whole class. Thus, in CECL class, the atmosphere is always warm and exciting. There are almost 20 practical topics in CECL,  [wd3,8-3] concerning a wide range. [sn8,s] It's not listening lesson, neither oral English lesson nor writing lesson. But equally more of  [pr1,4-3] these are ruled out. Students are the centre of the lesson [wd3,-] in [fm2,-] stead of the teacher, which, few other courses can have this as a characteristic.[sn8,s] A Friend[sn9,-] A friend is who, when you have been painstakingly travelled along your river of life and want some  support , appears  like a paddle of a boat. A friend is the breeze in summer and the bright sunshine in winter. He pats on your shoulder to give you strength and a sign of under   standing [fm2,-]when you lose a match .Passing you a towel or a rink, " [fm3,-] one cannot  always be the champion [sn9,-]  don't [fm3,-] let yourself  [fm1,-] own!" [sn9,-]  he says slowly but firmly. He understands  [,2-12] when you   part with your girl- friend much better than your parents do ."How about a wrestling, we two?"  He finds a way  for you to blow off your steam. He   shorts [fm1,-]your ears when you've lying lazily on bed a whole day, "Hey ,guy, enough rest ! you have got to work now! Do not be a lagy [fm1,-]bone!" Sometimes, he is a patient brother,[sn9,-] in other time, he is a good guy to play with , and he could be one [wd3,-]instructor as serious as an old grandpa . A friend shares your sorrows and happiness. Also, he needs your comfort when in bad mosd [fm1,-]and invites you to enjoy his happiness. He may have some shortcomings, as  on [fm1,-] one is perfect . But you know him and understand him just as he always treats you appreciate your.[sn8,s] As time passes by, maybe you have charged a lot and so has he. Maybe you two are far away from each other. But a friend, who really deserves the word "friend" ,will never be far away. He is always on [wd3,-] your mind and he always  gives  you  courage and confidence. A friend is a priceless treasure. Returning books During the break, I went hurriedly to return some Chinese books. But when I got there, no assistants could been [fm1,-] seen. Suddenly, I heard an angry voice," These cheats! Such rotted gourd  worth  $2 per jin! " With these words , a head rose from below the counter.     Then another, "you have got to stand it  !" the latter and younger one tried to soothe the elder assistant , " Nowad [fm1, -] ay, people are crazy for money! They can do anything for that !" And she then started to complain how she had been cheated once. "Excuse me," I hesitatly[fm1,-] asked, "May I return the books now?" They stopped, turning to me. It seemed as if a volcano would erupt. "Pass it to me!" the younger lady came to me, checking the books," you made  these  marks?" she asked me coldly, lifting her eyebrows." You are doomed!" I said to myself.      "   well[fm3,-], No, when I started reading I found the wants [wd7,-] already there."" Why didn't you  fell  [fm1,-]us when you borrow it ? It  [wd7,1-2] want be you !" She raised her voice. I made   no answer -I could only admit it was a good lesson. I had thought the assistants must have made all the  checkings[fm1,-] and I had been in a hurry   when I borrowed it . At the very moment, the elder  lady joined the younger one. "Another scribbler?  FIWE! [fm1,-] " Two  [wd3,3-3] man  for  each place. How many has she got? One ...Three... Six ...!! [sn9,s] That's $ 1. 2!" No sooner had I caught what she said them a fine fill was in front of me. Skillful assistant! And I spent $1.2 buying a good lesson.. 

< ST 5> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GDUFS> <AGE ?> <WAY ?> <DIC ? > <TYP 2>?? Dear Mr Smith, I'm sorry to disturb you . but I'd like to make a complaint with [wd3,-] you . I've been living for 5  years and used to have a peaceful and tranquil  life. But since you moved  in last  month. [sn9,-] I find myself [wd7,3-2] smote by noise, which has a rather bad effect on me . I know that you are a musician and have made a  small name [cc1,1-]of your own. You go to concert every night and come back late. But when you are going to bed , you  drop   the shoes on the  floor and the  sound is loud enough to awake and   start[wd3,-] me. When I wake up.[sn9,-]I am unable to drop back to sleep soon. I haven't had a good sleep for days now, neither can I  [wd3,3-5] make it up in the morning, for then, you are plactising [fm1,-] your saxophone. The music is good but a little bit louder. It not only puts an end to my repose, but also makes me unable to hear the  [fm1,-] whether broadcast on the radio or the news about stock market on TV. In addition to that. [sn9,-] You host a party every weekend and will not disperse [wd3,-] it until 2 o'clock in the morning. It drives my sleep away. When I am lying in bed with eyes open, I can clearly hear the jazz music from the recorder,the laughter f your friends and I even know that one of your friend is nicknamed " cooodpecker" . I do not mean to put my nose into your affair, but how can I possibly keep the noise out of my house? If you would please to  dissoloe [fm1,-] [wd7,5-3]the party earlier, put down the shoes gently and postpone your time of practising saxphone [fm1,-]I would be much obliged . With best wishes. Yours sincerely Three kinds of friends enter my life, tinge it with colours and add its richness: the close friends, the nodding friends and the good-weather [wd7,-1] friends. I appriciate[fm1,-] and truly love my close friends, because I an confide in them   nd [fm1,-]in return I am trusted by them, I precious[wd2,1-2] such friendship. Because it is rare to obtain.  Common interests link us together and critical time tests the soundness of the friendship. Though there are no frequent exchange of presents and no sweet  [wd2,2-2] flatter between us, I m clearly aware that they really care for me as much as I  [wd4,9-1] them , and will jump with alacrity at my asking for  elp[fm1,-] . They give me their hand when I am in bad time, listen patiently to the troubles I pour out to them, and  some how [fm2,-]remove it magically . To stay with them is happy because I can wear my heart[cc3,2-] on the sleeve and need not keep myself to myself. Straight  [wd3,-]for word remarks even [np6,3-2] criticism are welcomed. They are unlikely to make offences for we  know that such frankness is true and sincere. We share the secrets, rapture and sorrow. I welcome nodding friends and cherish good will and sincerity toward them. We can get along well by joking [sn9,-]  talking [sn9,-]  story-telling or playing  ogether [fm1,-], though we would not touch the deeper issues of one's mind. And when meeting by chance. [sn9,-] [fm3,-] We pick up some general and  afe [fm1,-]topics like what happens to a friend recently, or whether she or he likes the job or what place  [pr5,2-2] where I visited last summer vocation. Even when we happen to have disputes no one bother to speak out . When we depart,  [pr1,3-] it become a part of the memory. No regret for departure, but  [sn2,6-5] is willing to meet next ime [fm1,-].   They often bring laughter and fun to my life, and even a "Hello" in the street makes my heart light. To those good-weather [wd7,-1] friends, I dislike them. Because I know they can flatter me to the top of the sky when I am in luck, and they can also shovel me on the ground and pique my dignity. They are [wd7,2-3] adows [fm1,-]in the sun and will disappear into this air as soon as darkness befalls. I have been in two middle schools to receive my secondary education. One is the Attached Middle School of GUFL, the other is Guangzhou No.2 Middle School. No.2 Middle School is a key school in Guangzhou, there fore [fm2,-] in comparison to the former one, it is more  [aj3,3-3] strict in many aspects. First, No. 2 Middle School has higher [aj3,s-]demand for the entrants. Because of its fame, is school attracts many students who hope that they can better [wd4,2-4]education nd [fm1,-]training for the college entrance  [np6,3-1] examination. Due to the large number of applicants, the school is able to undergo strict selection. Good and potential students are enrolled, thers [wd7,6-1]rejected. While the Attached School is only a common chool[fm1,-], although it is quite famous for its nglish [fm1,-]teaching and aclievements [fm1,-], it attracts far less students, not to speak of scientific students. The grade line for the extrance [fm1,-] is correspondingly lower. The overall quality of he tudents, there fore[fm2,-], is not encouraging . Second, he  [fm2,-] NO.2 [fm1,-] MiddliSchool  [fm1,-] ets[fm1,-] up a higher standard for its students on their study. The textbooks, especially maths, physics and chemistry textbooks it ases [wd7,9-3] are more diffult [fm1,-]than those of  [np6,2-2] Attached School. he students are not only required to digest the knowledge in the book, but also trained by doing a lot of additional and more complicated exercises to expand their skill. While in the ttached [fm1,-]School , due to the overall quality of the students, most of them are only  [vp7,5-2] require to understand and master what the textbooks say and use these knowledgt [fm1,-]to do the exercises that are not difficult to deal with. In addition, the strictness of NO.2 Middle School is lustrated  [fm1,-] in its daily-life. Although it is not a boarding school. [sn9,-] the leaders are very much oncerned [fm1,-]with students' appearance and behaviour. Students are forbidden to coear [fm1,-]ornaments, boys are not allowed to have long hair, long fingernails  [vp3,2-1] is unbearable. There are often sudden checks on this. Further more [fm2,-], students are required to wear uniform at least 3   ays [fm1,-]a week. Even in [wd7,2-2] oozen[fm1,-] winter mornings, girls have to wear their uniform of western-style dresses. Those who violate the rules would be criticized openly. This phenomenon however has never happened in the Attached School. Students are free to wear colourful clothes, and have small ornaments to add [cc6,-]up their beauty. This is away vigorates [wd7,3-2] the campus.[sn8,s] CECL, the full name of which is Communicative English for Chinese Learner [np6,5-6]  is a set of comprehersive [fm1,-]textbooks. It covers such knowledge as greeting people, job, food , sports, tourism, economy, and so on ,  [wd4,3-4] each aspect as a unit. In each unit, there includes the training of listening , reading, oral English writing and role play .  [fm1,-] ne characteristic of CECL is its large amount of new words. Therefore, before the start of a new unit , he teacher will ive [fm1,-] each student a list of the new words of the unit . Students may look up the words in the dictionary and get themselves familiar with the meanings and us ages. Futher [fm1,-]preparation depends on the tasks which will be done in class. Listening exercises, which , often is the first part in a unit , need no preparations. Before the exercise begins, the teacher will give several minutes for the students to look through the instructions as well as the questions. Then they may listen to the tape twice and do the task (either fill in some blanks or answer questions ) at the same time. After that, the teacher will give the answers and analyse the tcpscrips[fm1,-]. Then comes the second exercise, reading [sn9,-]  usually, students are required to read the articles before class, look up some words , and have a rough idea of the  out line  [fm2,-]of the articles. In  [np6,1-3] the class the teacher  [fm1,-] ill explain some language points and draw students' attention to some useful words and expressions. When the students have  [vp4,4-3] make clear of the contents exercise be done[sn8,s], which help the students to a better understanding. Since the articles in a certain unit are all selected to introduce the topic from different angles, it is important that the students have mastered the essence of it. Group discussion appears in a unit frequently. It provides good  [np6,3-3] opportunity for the students to prictice [fm1,-]their spoken English. The topics discussed are closely concerned with the unit. Students are encouraged to express their ideas freely. And by listening to others  opinion [fm1,-] [np6,5-2] , they have a deeper impression about the text.  Role play is another kind of practice. It calls for the students to take part in the play without teachers intervention. [pr3,14-3] They are the writers as well as actors. They use what they have learned from the unit and try to make the play as vivid and real as possible.  General[wd2,0-1] speaking, CECL is an unique course in which  [np6,0-2] teacher and students play equal roles. [sn9,-] Students volutarily [fm1,-] take part in the activities and  there fore [fm2,-] master the knowledge more effectively . There is no doubt that our life is colorful . But it does not exclude boredom, an in dispensible [fm2,-]  element without [pr5,3-10] whose contrast [wd7,3-9]  life would no longer appears so interesting and wonderful . What is boredom then? It is a dull, uninteresting tedious feeling people have when they have nothing to do or are not interested in doing the things at hand. Students often suffer from boredom, when they lose their earings [fm1,-] or have no interests in study. Hollowness and impatience often occupy their  [np6,1-1] heart and has  [np7, 1-1] a effect on their further studies. Hobby and different hings[fm1,-] they take up [sn8,s]. Attending class may be dull , because some of the knowledge is losing its attraction, and the way in which some teacher lecture [vp3,2-3] bores the listeners. Students in our class all agree that The Construction of Socialism is boring, not at all because we have anti-government idea or we dislike the idea. The teacher will simply stand at the platform, reading at the top of his voice the sentences which we can find in the text book [fm2,-]. What use does his lecture have while we have eyes to read the textbook ourselves?" How boreing[fm1,-] it is!" is the concensus [fm1,-]  we get after each class. Boredom is a company not only to students but also to those who work and don't work. It seems   contra[fm2,-] dictary at the first sight. But if we know that monotony and repetition are often the featlres [wd7,3-2] of work, it is not difficult to see that even you have something to do at hand. You may still feel bored. It is how I felt when I went to the Trade Fair a few weeks ago. When there were few customers we did nothing but talk or go round and round. This let's-sit-here-and-talk-to-kill-the-time pattern bored me a lot and I was tired and uninterested in anything. Boredom is a common disease in the souety [fm1,-], but not an incurable one. The best way to frive [fm1,-] it away is to find something which is really of your interest, do it and enjoy it. This is a funny experience I will never forget. One day, with 20 yuan in my trousers' pocket I went to downtown area with a friend. The No. 36 bus we took was crowded .we got on and stood near the door . a [fm3,-] young man was standing behind me ,one hand taking hold of the iron bar overhead .  as[fm3,-] the bus picked up more passengers along its route, I began worrying about thieves.  luckily[fm3,-] I had never met them, though I often heard about their "good deeds " on buses . so [fm3,-]consciously, but pretending to be carelessly , I touched my pocket. The money was there,  save[fm1,-] and sound .  several [fm3,-]minutes later, I was aware that a woman was looking at me strangely, her face wearing an expression that I couldn't fully explain. Just then, I felt there was a slight touch of my pocket, as if something was moving inside [sn9,-]  I looked down to find the money was somehow drawn out and was about to fall to the floor [sn9,-]  I could hear my heart beat faster than ever, knowing clearly that I had become a bait of a thief. Hurriedly I pushed the money back, turned suddenly back and faced the young man behind me. Obviously he didn't expect that would happen .  [fm3,-] he was quite uncomfortable [fm1,-]  under my staring and hastily looked away.         "well," I said in a low voice, "didn't get it , Eh?" my words took him by surprise. Perhaps he had wanted me to keep silent or abuse him loudly and get beaten. But I was not trapped [sn9,-] [fm3,-] my friendly manner made him [wd4,5-3]  at a loss. "um um, " he made his head move up and down, and squeazed [fm1,-] a smile on his face . "It is really bad luck, isn't it ?" I asked him, nearly jokingly. He was not that nervous , but was still embarrassed to be  [fm1,-] caugh red-handed. " [fm3,-] hope you good luck next time," I said and  [vp6,3-0] smile. " [fm3,-] thank you ."  [fm3,-] he was almost grateful at my words and even friendly patted my shoulder.  [fm3,-] as the bus stopped, I jumped off, and could [wd7,2-8] at wait to tell my friend all about it . " [fm3,-] you must be  [fm1,-] crasy," she said, " aren't you afraid that he would stab you ?"  [fm3,-] no, I was not [sn9,-]   [fm3,-] it was a strange but true experience. I was surprised why my heart was not at my throat when I spoke to the man and I still do not know now.  [fm3,-] perhaps he was not a bad guy at all and perhaps in his eye ,I was still a  [fm1,-] na* ve [fm1,-]but daring little girl. [sn9,-] 

<ST 5><SEX 2><Y 8><SCH Zhongda><AGE 21><WAY 1><DIC 1><TYP 1>                          Study Problems      Two years' studing [fm2,-]  in the university tells me that the studying in university is totally different from that in middle school. The study problems take on a new look before us. So finding a way to solve the problems is especially important for us.      When we were in middle school, teachers cared about everything of [pp1,3-1]  us. They not only taught us knowledge [cc3,2-] , but also kept inspiring us and supervised [vp5,4-1]  us as much as possible. From 7 a.m to 8 p.m, we stayed at school, together with our teachers. But now except when it is in class, we practically can't see our teachers.  This is the study in college.  It depends more and more on ourselves. Teachers only teach us knowledge [cc3,2-] .  Therefore, problems of studying come into sight. Firstly, we don't know how to arrange the time. There is a lot of free time in college. We, of course, won't spend all of them [pr1,14-]  on study; Secondly [fm3,-] , we don't know where we can place emphasis on [pr1,8-] ,the compulsory courses or the courses we're interested in; Lastly [fm3,-] , we don't know how to put what we learn in class into practice. Our practical skill is terribly poor.    After two years, we all find our ways. The college life has a very clear[cc4,-] frame. What we should do is to fill up the frame. Problems can't frighten us. The key point is whether we can find the way to solve them.  In university, we, of course, should pay much attention to our study, but at the same time, we'd better do some part-time jobs to make up for what we can't learn in class. And also we should communicate with our teachers actively. Let our teachers help us to solve the study problems. We believe we all have the ability to face the study problems in university.

Patriotism    This is an event nearly every Chinese mailand [fm1,-]  people and Hong Kong people alike have been  awaiting with massive [cc4,-1]  excitement and great expectation -- the reunification of Hong Kong to China.  It is a moment of celebration, proud [wd2,4-1] , anticipation and above all, the most telling moment of patriotism which is deep in our heart [np6,1-] .  And this moment is 1997, arriving in several hours from now, as we are approaching July 1st.     Patriotism, which is something beyond words, is what people of different nationalities share universally, and is also a blessing for every nation.  To people, on numerous occasions, it is a mighty momentom [fm1,-] , spurring us to implement [cc3,-4]  the most formidable tasks which would have been impossible otherwise. In [np7,-2]  Olympic Games, you can not only feel the touching emotion of patriotism, but also come face to face with it: you see how athletes surmount the various "hurdles" with applaudible [fm1,-] stamina and most important, fortitude, whose sourse [fm1,-]  is exactly their love of their country; you see athletes fall from illness but stand up to their task even with a dripping; you see athletes stumble to the ground but climb up and go ahead; you also see champions cry movedly [fm1,-]  when  their national flag rising [vp4,4-1]  proudly.  At such [np7,1-1]  moment, they are no longer themselves, rather, their country and their people who also embrace the same burning patriotism and back them all the time.  Outside the stadium, patriotism draws people to TV, newspaper [np6,5-] , focusing on what's going on in the games; even they would fly to the spot somewhere far far away from their home [np6,12-] .  They care for nothing but their country.  We Chinese always take pride in our patriotism.  With it, not only have we weathered untold defeats, shame, poverty, natural disasters, political strife, financial crisis, but also we are building [vp1,-3]  up our country industriously and hopefully.  The recent years have witnessed the prosperity in our economics [wd3,3-] , advancement in education, improvement in diplomacy ... .  We owe all our delighting and impressive achievements to our leadership, to our people's efforts, to international aids and above all to the profound patriotism in everyone of us.  In this sense, patriotism means a lot to a nation especially to such a big country as China which was burdened with myriad historic wounds and is expecting countless obstacles and challenges to come.  To a country, Patriotism [fm3,-]  means cohesiveness [wd3,2-] .  Cohesiveness [wd3,-2]  means omnipotence,  With it, we are fearless. The story of Hong Kong tells much of this.  People of the same nationality and therefore possessing the same ardent patriotism want to be united together and have to be together.  With this in mind, we have been making [vp2,-2]  our utmost to negotiate and eventually reach an agreement on the issue of Hong Kong territory with [np7,-2]  British governement [fm1,-]  but for [pp1,15-3]  all the barriers.    It is a dream to come true.  This dream has been both long [wd3,5-]  and hard [wd3,7-]  for us, while, in the end, the reality in the wake of the dream is sure to be promising and encouraging.  With the same patriotism in mind, we're to live up to our designated aims ahead -- to embrace HongKong [fm3,-]  and still to come, Macao and Taiwan and to better an integret [fm1,-]  China all the time.

Some of the troubled students know what their own study problems are, but they don't know in what way they can handle them.    In order to pass examinations, students should remember many datum [np6,1-4] , events, and new words.  Most of the students can remember them only in a few hours.  However, they will forget most things they recite the next day.  This is an ordinary problem in our studies.  In this case, we'd better recite those specific and limited [wd3,6-1]  things not in one day but in many separate days.  We can remember a little each day so that we are able to turn them over in our mind [np6,2-]  and we can remember them clearly afterwards.  Some college students are buffled [fm1,-]  by the question of which optional courses they should take.  There are a lot of optional courses they can take, but they don't know which is the best and most benefitial [fm1,-] . In my opinion, we'd better take the courses which are related to our major, because we can make progress in our major in this way. Of course, we  should consider if it is interesting or enlightening.  If not but we take it [sn2,6-s] , we will not continue the study or study it unwillingly.     What I mentioned above are just the most ordinary problems in students' studies.  There are also many other problems, such as having difficulty in listening English [wd5,4-] , doing experiments with difficuty [fm1,-]  and so on.  However, if we analysis [wd2,2-2]  these problems carefully, we will find the solution and conquer them and we will make much progress during the course of solving these problems.

Learning English mostly depends on daily listening, speaking and writing, so I am weak in these aspects.    Listening class is my favourist [fm1,-]  class.  I can always get a good sleep in the class. Not because of the teacher's fault, but because the V.O.A or BBC's tone makes me feel sleepy. The text book [fm2,-]  is acceptable, but sometimes I cannot catch even  a  word if the speaker says [wd3,3-3]  a little quickly.  I like speaking more than listening, but it is still y weakness. When I have [np7,3-3]  oral English class  and have a talk with my foreign teacher, I find it is difficult to have me understood entirely.  With some kind of body language or illusions [wd3,7-] , both [wd4,1-1]  us can understand each other. Writing is our basic skill.  But even as a senior student. I cannot write a satifying [fm1,-]  essay.  In a no-more-than 200-word essay, there are full of either grammar or spelling mistakes and teacher's red crosses. [sn8,s]   Sometimes there is a good idea striking me, but I can't express it out [wd5,4-]  with words.    I am very anxious about my study problems.  I am trying to listen more, speak more and write more.  I should recite more words too.  Without a great amount  of vocabulary, how can I make progress in my study?

I quite appreciate it. But what troubles me most is also study. Study goes, problem goes.   What I focus on, of course, is my majoy [fm1,-] ---English.  Commonly, English contains three fators [fm1,-] ---Speaking [fm3,-]  , Listening [fm3,-]  and writing. Firstly, I don't have the environment to improve my English. Most of the time, I speak Chinese with my classmates. Only in class or at English corner I just get the chance to speak English. However, it's far from enough.  But if I kept speaking English to everyone, others may [vp8,9-3]  laugh at me and think I'm a queer fish!  Similarly, I speak Chinese all the time and I listen to it all the time. This makes my listening rather weak. Although I train myself through other ways, the reality of my listening is still disappointing me. Comparing [vp5,-6]  with other two factors, writing seems to require less objective elements. Therefore I just read a lot and memorize words, paterns [fm1,-] , [wd4,2-1] expressions. I don't know if forgetting is a natural phenomenon, if it is, I do [wd3,13-]  and I include it as one problem. [sn1,s] I also have problems in my non-English courses. I think some of these subjects are useful and practical---like Chinese, Study of life, etc., however, some are just compulsory and useless. [sn1,s]They sometimes become burdens of my study. In short, some of the problems can be overcome subject to my greater efforts. Some of them need all the students of English and the Institute to settle together. If we are cooperative and build an English World with our two hands, I think all the students will make a great success in English study.

The most common ones I've encountered are unable to concentrate in class, having no time practising by myself and hard to communicate with others. [sn8,s]   Class [wd3,-6]  is the original source of knowledge when [np7,1-7]  teacher tells whatever he knows to us. But I find I am unable to focus on  him especially for the most boring part, which is usually the most practical part. I've tried in vain to restrict myself to listen to him to the word [wd5,5-3]  for several times. So sometimes I think it's high time he changed his way of teaching so as to make the class attracting [wd3,3-4]  to most of us. Then the spare time. [sn2, s-]  As a sophomore I have much more spare time now, but in fact, I still cannot find sufficient time to practise what I learn.  There are too many activities and lectures that the school authority required [vp6,11-5]  us to take part in.  I wonder when we can select those activities and lectures by ourselves.  Lastly, the communication. [sn2,s-] As we know, study is a process of communicating [wd3,5-] .  In this process, we exchange what we have for what others don't, and therefore make mutual progress. This is  essential either for our studies or for the teaching of a whole school. But except we communicated privately in small group, I rarely had chances to participate in such activities between colleges during the past two years . [sn8,s]    In short, those problems mentioned do harm to our studies and we should try to overcome them. But we cannot accomplish the task alone. With the help of our teachers and the school authority, I'm sure we can make it and furthermore obtain [cc3, -3]  a mutual improvement.

The President The Foreign Languages Institute Guangzhou, China Dear Sir,    I am very glad to receive your offer of appointment in your institute and I will accept it with great pleasure.  But I hope you can change the appointment from 1st February, 1997 to 31st January, 1999 to 1st September, 1997 to 31st August, 1999 because I have to complete work in translation and compilation in progress[wd7,1-] in London.

In study, a student has to solve endless problems until he finds the right way to learn. In my opinion the fundemantle [fm1,-]  problems in study are two: lack of interest and lack of persistence.  Some students consider study as a [wd5,3-3]  painstaking work all because they don't care for the things they learn. We can always find a student doing well in maths while being poor at English. But once this student interests [vp1,3-2]  in English, he will [wd4,2-3]  eager to learn. Interest is the best guide. Persistence is also an important factor in study.  No man [wd3,1-8]  in the world can gain all the knowledge over-night.  All we can do is to accumulate it little by little and review it period after period. [np1,2-] Some students are quick at learning but they learn too fast therefore they keep forgetting. So they would complain [vp1,2-4]  the hardship of study and name it a problem. The solutions to the study problems are fights against the brain. [cc3,3-]The brain refuses to take in dull information, and it keeps forgetting things. But the willpower is the fatal weapon to conquer its laziness. Where there is a will, there is a way.

Both natives and travelers have many choices as to means of transportations [np5,2-]  in Guangzhou.   Taking bus is many people's choice. Workers, students, and travelers also like to take [wd4,1-1]  bus, for taking bus is very cheap and convinient [fm1,-] , with substaintal [fm1,-]  [wd3,1-1]  buses available.  But the biggest shortcoming is its slowliness [fm1,-]. Very often, at rash [fm1,-] hour, you may hit traffic jams. The other important means is bycical [fm1,-] .  China is well known as the "kingdom of bycical [fm1,-] ."  So in Guangzhou, everywhere is packed with bycicals [fm1,-] .  People cycle to work, to school, to shopping. [sn8,s] However, bycicals [fm1,-]  are easy to be stolen.  Many people like to take [wd4,1-1]  taxi, the most fast [aj3,3-]  means in the city, but you have to have enough money and be cautions [wd2,1-3]  with the meter, for some drivers are not honest. To travel out of the city, certaily [fm1,-] ,  the best way is by plane. It's a comfortable, luxious [fm1,-]  enjoyment[cc1,-2] of traveling. However, most people travel by train, which is economical, fast, and safe. Trains directing [wd3,1-6]  to every big city of China are available here.  Throughout the year, the railway stations are full of travellers. One warning to travellers is that you have to be careful of your purses and luggiges [fm1,-] , for thieves are in large quantity [wd3,4-3]  at the station.   On the whole, Guangzhong's transportation is rather convinent [fm1,-] , but because of the large number of people and narrow streets, it is still a problem at [pp1,-3]  the government's agenda.  New means, for example undergrounds, is [vp3,5-]  being added and broad roads are being built.

But would you mind my changing the time period instead from 1st September, 1997, [sn9,-]  to 31st August, 1999, because I want to complete work in translation and compilation already in progress in London?  Thank you for the offer of appointment again.  I do hope my work in London will be of great benefit to me and to the Institute in any teaching, translation, interpretation, or compilation work I may be called upon to do.   I'm looking forward to your reply.                                                              Yours sincerely,                                                             Robert Lee

Transportation is one of the important factors in a city.  As our former mayal [fm1,-]  said , "Only when there are excellent means of transportations [np6,2-] , Guangzhou can be developed into a modernized city."    Until now, bicycles are still the major means of transportation in Guangzhou.  Riding a bike is not only saving one's time but also practising [cc3,-2]one's body.  Moreover, bicycles are convenient to go across narrow streets, which other means of transportation can't do.  Next, Buses [fm3,-]  and taxies are also very popular in my city.  They are not expensive and are quite suitable for these [pr2,4-8]   who don't like to walk or ride bicycles.  When we are not in a hurry, and when you [pr3,9-4]  don't want to take in the polluted air filling [wd5,3-3]  in the city, we'd better choose ships as a mean [wd3,1-2]  of transportation.  Standing on the deck, with the breeze stroking your face, won't you feel relaxed and refreshing [vp5,5-] ?  The holiday's coming.  If you want to go to other provinces or even go abroad, trains and aeroplanes are the right choice [np6,6-] .  Nowadays trains and planes have first-class equipment and good services.  Some of the planes even have televisions with different channels for you to choose.  Finally, there is magnificant [fm1,-]  [wd3,-1]  news in recent days.  That is our subway trains [wd5,1-]  being put in use.  That will add to the convenience of Guangzhou's transportation in the future.    When I [wd4,2-2]  walking along the streets or roads, seeing different means of transportation playing a more and more significant role, not matter on the road, in the sky or under our city, I always feel proud of my city.  Furthermore, I am looking forward to the beautiful future.

I should be very grateful if you would kindly let me know whether my request is acceptable or not by return mail. Thanks again for the offer of appointment.  I hope my work in London will be of great benefit to the institute and myself in any teaching, translation, interpretation, or compilation work I may be called upon to do.

<ST 5><SEX 2><Y 8><SCH Zhongda><AGE 20><WAY 1><DIC 1><TYP 1>           Means of Transportation in China     The condition of trasportation [fm1,-]  in China has been greatly improved in order to meet the demands of the rapid economic progress and the expanding population.  The number of vehicles has sharply increased, and at the same time, more and more roads, railways, airports [sn9,-]  etc. are being built up [wd5,8-] .The means of transportation varies plentifully [wd3,5-] , offering quick and confortable [fm1,-]  transportation to the people.     Amony [fm1,-]  those means of transportation, vehicles are most popular in short distance transportation.  As you can see, there are massive [wd3,2-3]  buses and taxis which can take you to every corner [wd3,6-3]  in our city in a short time.  Meanwhile, more and more cars or other kinds of vehicles are privately owned by many richer people, which adds to the number of the vehicles.  However, bicycles are by no means obsolete while most of the people are not rich or try to avoid traffic jam.  Travelling by train is always adopted [wd3,5-]  when people travel farther [wd3,3-] , so railways develop fastest.  Travelling by train is comparatively cheap, quick and comfortable.  And trains can carry goods  on [np7,1-2]  large scale.  So travelling by train is the major means in long distance transportation.  Nowadays, travelling by plane is no longer a dream to many people whilst our economic [wd5,1-5]  income increases gradually and steadily.  It is the quickest and the most comfortable way of travelling.  And it will be prevalent in the near future.  Of all the means of transportation, travelling by ship is the most slowest [aj3,2-] , but ships can carry a very large number [wd3,3-2]  of goods and cover a very long distance in a long period, so ships are usually used in commercial delivery, especially in  overseas delivery.     In short, transportation has developed greatly and will make more progress.  At present in China, anyone can have a good trip by selecting an appropriate means of transportation and enjoy himself.

I have pleasure in accepting your kind offer of appointment, but I wish to make a request that the appointment be made instead from 1st September, 1997, [sn9,-]  to 31st August, 1999.

<ST 5><SEX 1><Y 8><SCH Zhongda><AGE 20><WAY 1><DIC 1><TYP 1> Means of Transportation in My City     When asked what is my city famous for, I am always blurting [vp6,15-]  out:  Bicycle!  It is true that nowadays in my city many bus routes have been opened up.  But still, people in my city prefer [vp2,4-4]  bicycles rather than buses.     There are several reasons leading people to chose [fm2,-]  bicycles as their main means of transportation.  First, riding bicycles  offers people a great degree of freedom and independence.  With it, they can go anywhere at any time.  Second, to some people, especially to us students, it is an economical alternative to the bus whose fares have kept rising five times running in recent year.  Third, most people just want to stay away from the traffic jam [np6,11-] .  The disturbing situation in my city is that just a few efficient buses have been put into service on the one hand [sn9,-]  the number of broad roads is extremely limited on the other.  Before the bus comes, a lot of people are queuing for it.  When the bus comes, people tend to fight around [wd3,2-]  and get the narrow escape  from the crowd and eventually get on the bus which has always crowded [vp7,4-]  like a satine [fm1,-]  can.  Even though you are lucky enough to board on [wd5,1-2]  the bus, it often takes ages for the bus to arrive at your destination, for the bus are vp3,2-2]  very inefficient and the operation of the road almost come [vp3,6-3]  to a standstill.  It's the serious problem that underlies the people's lack of interest in taking buses.    My city is famous for bicycle, however, I am no [wd3,2-5]  so pround  [fm1,-]  of this fame.  The government of the city has being taken [vp7,7-6]  measures to improve the traffic situation and the constructions of new road are underway.  I really hope that buses and cars will be the new means of transportation in the near future.

<ST 5><SEX 2><Y 8><SCH Zhongda><AGE 20><WAY 1><DIC 1><TYP 1>            Means of Transportation in Guangzhou          Since Guangzhou is an over-populated city, its daily transportation has been a great social problem for years.  Nowadays, with  various means of transportation available, this problem appears to be improved.     First, bicycles are the main means of transportation in people's daily life in Guangzhou.  It is estimated that every family in Guangzhou have an average of two or three bicycles.  Because bicycles are inexpensive and take up not much room, they are quite convenient and become the most popular means of transportation among people.  Second, buses are the second widely used means of transportation in Guangzhou.  Some people's homes are too far away from their working places for them to ride a bicycle, so they choose to take buses everyday.  In addition, buses are faster than bicycles and sitting in a bus is more comfortable than riding a bicycle in the changeable weather in Guangzhou. Third, taxis and cars are also one of the means of transportation in Guangzhou, but  are  not so popular as bicycles and buses, mainly because of its expensive costs.  Moreover, to own a car is not practical in Guangzhou, such a over-populated city.  Fourth, the subway is not so popular a means of transportation as in other big cities like Beijing and Shanghai.   But I believe that with its commonization [fm1,-]  in the future, it will be of great convenience for the people in Guangzhou and should be the most effective solution to the heavy traffic problem.      Although our city is over-populated, with the above [wd3,2-3] means of transportation people will still find it convenient to go to their destination [np6,10-]  in daily life.  I hope with the development of economy and technology our problem of the transportation will be completely and perfectly solved in the near future.

And I am glad to inform you that I decide to accept your offer of appointment.  There is just one request I want to make.  Can I shift [wd3,2-10]  the period from 1st September, 1997, [sn9,-] to 31st August, 1999. [sn9,-]  instead of from 1st February, 1997, [sn9,-]  to 31st January, 1999.

<ST 5><SEX 2><Y 8><SCH Zhongda><AGE 19><WAY 1><DIC 1><TYP 1>                         Means of Transportation in China    With the development of economy, transportation has become a more and more important problem in China.  Transportation is also a big problem which has close relationship with people's life.  In the following I'd like to talk about the five most popular transportaters [fm1,-]  in China, they are bicycles, buses, trains, ships and planes.   Firstly, bicycles.  Most foreigners who come to China were [vp6,6-2]  always shocked at the first sight of so many bicycles in our streets.  To most Chinese people bicycles are the most popular  and useful transportater [fm1,-]  in their daily lives. Wherever [wd3,-6]  go to school, work or do some shopping they always ride a bicycle. [sn8,s]   China has so many bicycles that it is called "the empire of bicycles"; [sn9,-]  Secondly, buses.  Buses are also an important transportater [fm1,-]  Chinese people use in their daily lives. I think the situation of bus-taking has been greatly improved in China, especially in some big cities. And now many small towns also have buses, which is a great convenience to residents there. Thirdly, trains.  Many students who come from other provinces or other cities in our university take trains when they go back home. Trains maybe are the most popular transportater [fm1,-]  in the long-distance trip.  Because it [pr1,12-]  doesn't cost too much and is very convenient to take. [sn2,s-]  Now the speed of all the trains in China has been increased and many short-distance routes have been concealed [wd3,5-6]  in order to attract more train-takers. Fouthly [fm1,-] ,ships. I think not many people in China will choose ships when they have other choices, such as trains or planes.  Except in some particular conditions such as travelling on the Changjiang River. [sn2,s-]   Finally, planes.  Because of the high costs, not many people in China take planes. But I must say now more and more people take planes on their trips.  I believe planes will become the most popular transportater [fm1,-]  in the future, providing [wd3,-8]  people can pay the prices [wd3,2-3]  of the tickets.    Of course there are other transportaters [fm1,-]  which are popular in Chinese people's daily life, such as motobicycles [fm1,-] , cars, etc.  But I think the above-mentioned five transportaters [fm1,-]  are the most important and popular.  People can't live without them. This is the point.

But the transportation is most busy [aj3,1-] .  As the city develops, various means of transportation appear and benefit us a lot.     Traditionally, bike [np6,-6]  and motorcycle [np6,2-4]  are two main transportators [fm1,-]  to most residents.  Without waiting for buses and rushing, people can ride their "iron horse [np6,5-] " to works [vp5,5-] .  As the scale of the city extents [wd3,6-] , more and more buses are put into running [wd3,5-] .  Besides, many people become rich enough to buy their own cars.  wd4,-6]  Automobile gradually takes the place of "iron horse". Nowadays, we can see people taking clean buses or driving private owned [wd5,1-1]  cars with air condition [wd3,3-]  everywhere.  But pollution and transportion [fm1,-]  order remain two big problems.     However, Guangzhou's underground has been built to serve people this year.  Those who live in Fangchun district [fm3,-]  or Tianhe district [fm3,-]  are no longer worried about transportation.  The future buildings on the ground will be arranged reasonably.  Further more [fm2,-]  the waste gas given off by automobiles will be lessened.  This means of transportation is of great importance in Guangzhou's modernization.   Looking back upon our transportation in the past fifteen years, we can also see the changes of Guangzhou.  I think the abundant means of transportation represent the rapid progress of a modern city.

I am glad to accept this appointment with gratitude. I wonder if you can change the time of my appointment instead from 1st September, 1997 to 31st August, 1999 since I want to complete the work in translation and compilation already in progress in London.

<ST 5><SEX 2><Y 8><SCH Zhongda><AGE 20><WAY 1><DIC 1><TYP 1> Means of Transportation in China     China is world-wide [fm2,-]  known for her large population and vast land.  Therefore, transportation becomes one of the most important and serious issue [np6,7-]  about which people are concerned a lot.  Generally speaking, there are three means of transportation in China presently: by air, by water or on the land.  All of them have their own advantages and disadvantages [sn9,-]  which offer you a variety of choices.     By air, that is by plane, is the quickest, the most comfortable and convenient way.  You can sit watching TV, reading magazines or enjoying the beautiful view below you and arrive at you [pr4,2-1]  destination fresh and comfortable.  But the only problem is the expense.  It is expensive for  some Chinese.  Travelling on the ships in the river or on the sea is a longer journey.  You can meet interesting people to talk with and enjoy the various entertainments on the ship.  First of all, you must make sure you will not get seasick before you mount [cc3,-2]  the ship.  There are different ways for you to travel on the land.  You can travel by train, bus, taxi, bicycle and even on foot.  It is good for shorter journey and you can stop wherever you want.  There are other interesting and special means of transportation remained [wd5,9-2]  in China.  In my hometown, there is [np7,2-2]  two-horse carriage, [sn9,-] In Chaozhou, there is [np7,2-1]  rickshaw, in which you can travel around the city.  Now in Guangzhou, the first stretch of underground railway has been used [wd3,8-]  recently.    Our country provides [vp1,-5]  us a variety of choices to transport ourselves.  With the development of science and technology, I believe people in China will travel with ease and convenience in the future.

<ST 5><SEX 2><Y 8><SCH Zhongda><AGE 21><WAY 1><DIC ><TYP 1> Means of Transportation in my City    I live in Guilin, a very beautiful city.  It [wd4,1-2]  famous for its delicate hills [cc4,2-] , clear rivers, and special culture. From the means of transportation, you can see its common and its special characters.     Buses and trains are the most common transport tools [wd3, 4-] .  They carry native people, visiters [fm1,-], and commuters from one place to another place.  They are both very convenient to you, if you want to go to other places in [pp2,-2] high speed.   But if you don't need to go hurrily [fm2,-] , you'd better choose bicycles, the cheapest transport tool [wd3,3-]  in my city. You can ride on it as long as you want without paying any money. Meanwhile, it is a good exercise to keep you fit and well.     Since Guilin is a city with so many hills and rivers, why don't you visit on boat. [sn9,-]   Sitting on the boat, you can have a round look [cc4,3-4]  of the beautiful view -- the hills re all standing by the rivers.  But if you want to climb the hills, you'd better ask the workers to carry you, because the ill is so dangerous and steep.  Maybe, it is the most special trasport [fm1,-]  tool [wd3,4-]  in my city.    Bus [np6,-10] , train [np6,1-9] , bicycle [np6,2-8] , boat [np6,3-7] , and worker [np6,5-5]  are the main transport tools [wd3,3-]  in my city.  They all do contribution to the development of my city.

In the recent [pp2,2-] , patriotism has become a hot topic of talking [wd5,4-] .  To [pp2,-2]  my opinion, patriotism is a kind of common feeling which expresses people's respect and love to [wd3,3-2]  their country.  All of us should have it and show it in a correct direction.    Patriotism is Natalie a good feeling.  People all [wd4,2-2]  the world are pround [fm1,-]  of their own countries, whether they're richer than others or not.  As natives, we grew up in our motherland and the care of the people of our country.  What we should do is reward [wd3,5-] . In [np7,1-1]  history we know millions of people, Chinese or foreigners, devoted themselves to their motherlands, [sn9,-]  today, we can see so many people work hard for their countries.  All the ceremonies  and all the celebrations for HongKong's [fm3,-]  coming back in all the days are the best proof.  We should have patriotism without any doubt.    But patriotism doesn't mean keeping all the foreign things out. We have patriotism and we all hope we will have a strong motherland. We should understand our country needs development. So we need advanced equipments [np5,4-]  and experience to help us. Today's world is an "open" world, [sn9,-]  international mmunity [fm1,-]  is common.  If we want to have a strong motherland we can't refuse good foreign things. Our patriotism should be showed [fm3,-]  in a correct direction.   As Chinese, we are proud of our country.  The way we show our patriotism is to welcome everything benefit [wd2,3-]  to make our country strong.

The Modernization no longer stays [wd3,4-4]  barely on simple objects as industry, agriculture, defence, which originally are [vp6,5-4]  designed by our leaders; it extends to almost every part of our lives.    Modernization of our material world is easily seen: tremendous skyscrapers stand everywhere in big cities, confining our sights in a narrow sky; hundreds of motor-cycle [np6,2-]  block our way, leaving toxic gas all the way round; black rivers flow silently with all kinds of garbage  floating on it [pr1, 11-] , giving off terrible smell which reminds us of dead cats.  Modernization fills our pockets with money; however, it also somewhat ruined our lives.  Actually, these damages caused to our living enviroment [fm1,-]  are not the worst; what surprises e most is the 'bad modernization' of our mind.  Cheating, sex, murder, violence are filled [vp7,4-1]  everywhere, it might easily destroy your weak mind and your innocent children.  The most common thing, also the worst, is the indifference of us: we don't care about anybody; we only love ourselves.  We see people robbed, staged, lying dead on the street -- we just walk on, feeling nothing.    Modernization brings us material richness, changes our old cities into a new modern face [wd3,8-]  and makes our country more and more powerful -- all these are good -- diversely [wd3, 4-5]  it also pollutes our world, corrupts our mind [np6,1-]  and ruins our lives.  It is time for us to face up with the dark side of the Big Modernization.

In the past China was  so poor that people couldn't get enough food and the industry was almost broken down.  Now Chinese people all get enough food and various kinds of industrial departments [wd3,12-3]  are set up.  China has been on the road to progress.    Modernization has done great benefits to China.  First, through modernization China put [vp6,3-6]  out better industrial and consumer products.  Second, new roads, trucks and trains has [vp3,5-]  been put up [wd3,7-]  for the [wd5,6-2]  better transportation.  Last, China has provided people with new health care methods.       However, there are some problems caused by modernization.  As more factories have been put up, they send out poisonous gases, garbage, dirty water into the air and the rivers.  So people are faced with serious air pollution and water pollution. With the development of cities, more and more cars appear, and this causes traffic accidents and deaths.  These problems really cause a lot of troubles and misfortunes to our society.  Fortunately, our government has made steps to solve these problems.  The safe traffic regulations, the environment protect laws [wd3,3-]  and educational programs are done [cc3,10-]  to solve them and has [vp3,14-]  been in effect.     Conclusion: Modernization has made today's China more and more powerful and prosperous in spite of the problems which are unavoidable.  Modernization is the future of China -- A road of no return.

[sn6,s-]   The effect of patriotism is very great  when it is exercised [fm1, -]  by all the people of a country.  It can make a country  strong, and her history glorious.  It can also improves [vp4,3-] a man's character and secure for him a wide spread fame.       If the people of a country are not patriotic, the country must be very weak.  History tells us how some countries of ancient time [np6,4-]  were, owing to a lack of patriotism, conquered by other peoples and how the peoples of the conquered countries were made slaves under the yoke of their victorious masters.  Lessons taught by the history have been well learnt in our country.  Patriotism is strong now because of the efforts of generations of patriots.  Seeing the return of Hongkong, we Chinese with patriotism is [vp3,4-]  feeling very proud.  The more patriotism we have, the stronger the country will be.     In a word, to love our country, to work hard to make her strong, to support her trusted government, to obey her laws, to pay fair taxes into her treasury, to treat our fellow citizens as we wish to be treated ourselves -- this is to be a real Chinese patriot.  We should learn from all patriots and love our country as much as we love ourselves.

A person who is patriotic always bears his motherland in mind and is always ready to devote himself to the country.  In my opinion, nowadays, patriotism should be greatly encouraged among Chinese people.   China, a country with [np7,3-4]  large area and population, used to be invaded by the imperialists in ancient times; however, after our People's Republic of China came into existence, great changes have taken place in the country.  Under this circumstances [np6,2-] , the feeling of patriotism helps to develop the deep and friendly relationships among Chinese  people, and thus makes us hand in hand in our socialist constructions. [sn8,s]   It has been proved that if we Chinese unite together, we would be strong enough to resist any invasion or pressure from other countries, and our country would grow stronger and stronger.  Nowadays, all people in China have been concentrating on our socialist constructions [np5,1-] ; Moreover, some oversea [fm1,-]  Chinese, although have got the citizenship of other countries, [sn7,s-]  also give a strong support to the construction. And that is the theme [wd3,3-3]  of our race -- patriotism.  It is patriotism that connects us deep in heart and helps us work together in order to make a bright future for our motherland -- China.    In conclusion, I hope that patriotism will be encouraged in China, especially among the youth.  Let us hand in hand, with the dignified feeling of patriotism, to make our China a strong, beautiful and prosperous land in the world. [sn8,s]

Usually, we think study problems are the problems we can't do [cc3,4-]  or have difficulties [np1,1-2]  to do [cc3,9-] .  n fact, this is one of the problems in our studies.  Relatively wd3,-5] ,it is easier to resolve [wd3,5-] .   What's more important and what we should be clear [aj2,-s]  is that there are many other elements which we easily neglect and which somewhat influence our studies. First, is interest. [sn8,s]   It is said that interest is the best guide to make [wd5,4-1]  success.  It is almost impossible for us to study something very well if we are not interested in it at all. For example, I have no interest in drawing, so I can't draw a simple thing well until now.  Second, is method. [sn8,s]   If we can keep a good method to study.  I belive [fm1,-]  our studies will be efficient. To us, the most important  and difficult thing is how to find a good  method.  This is also a problem.  My advice is to practice many kind [np6,1-]  of methods and to choose one which suit [vp3,3-]  us well.  Third, is aim. [sn8,s]   It is very dangerous if we have no aims.  Aims are like light which is far away from us and which spur [vp3,9-]  us to close [wd3,4-2]  to it. Without aim, [np6,1-3]  we will be like in [wd4,4-2] darkness and will not to know [vp4,3-3]  what to do.  Fourth, is insistence [wd3,2-] . [sn8,s]   Although we have interest, method and aims, if we are lacking in insistence [wd3,5-] , we can't reach our goal.  Insistence [wd3,-4]  is a mental [wd3, 3-1]  problem. It is very abstract. Whether we have insistence [wd3,3-]  or not only depend [vp3,5-2]  on ourselves.  Finally, is environment about us. [sn8,s]   For example, I like to listen to [np7,2-1]  music when I'm working.  Music can't produce negative effect on we, on the contrast, it can help me to finish my work well, But [fm3,-]  many other people do [wd3,4-1]  not. [sn1,s]    Difficult questions are study problems. [sn8,s]  Interest, method, aim, insistence [wd3,3-3]  and invironment [fm1,-]  are also study problems. If we treat all of them accurately [wd3,6-] , we can study well.

I should be much obliged if you could make the appointment instead from 1st September, 1997, [sn9,-]  to 31st August, 1999, so that I can complete work in translation and compilation already in progress in London.     I thank you for your offer of the appointment.  And I do hope that my work in London will be of great benefit to me and to the Institute in any teaching, translation, interpretation, or compilation  work I may be called upon to do.    I look forward to your early reply of the changing [wd3,9-1]  appointment.   With many thanks.                                                                  Yours sincerely,                                                                 Robert Lee 

<ST 5><SEX 2><Y 8><SCH Zhongda><AGE 21><WAY 1><DIC 1><TYP 2>                                        Study Problems    Students usually find various problems during their studying. To  the language learning students, for example, some meet the [wd5,2-2]  grammer [fm1,-]  problems; some have difficulty in speaking or listening; some others are not good at writing [np7,1-2]  foreign language. How to overcome these study problems is very important for students' learning.    Students who are not skillful at grammer [fm1,-]  have to practise a lot.  They have to read some grammer [fm1,-]  books, grasp the main regulations [wd3,7-]  and they also need to do quite [np7,-4]  amount of grammer [fm1,-]  exercises.  The students who find difficulty in speaking should always  speak out and find chance to speak with the native speakers so that they can forster [fm1,-]  the sense of language and know the latest use of the language.  Shyness is a bad [wd5,1-1]  enemy to the  students.  When one is always shy to speak loud [wd2,1-] , one's speaking skill will become worse and worse. Also, the students who are bad at listening have to listen to the tapes or radio programmes often.  While listening, one should try one's best to understand its meaning and it is better for them to imitate the speaker.  After practising again and again, one's language will become better and better.  The last group of students who find it hard to write a good essay in foreign language have to read some books about writing skills and always think [vp1,1-3]  the foreign language instead of thinking [vp1,1-3]  their native language.  Before writing an essay, one had better look through some models, in order to learn some good expressions or good structures of an essay.     In short, every student will encounter some study problems during their studying years, and the best way to overcome this [pr1,13-1]  problems is to practise a lot.  By and by, students can learn more skills of studing [fm2,-]  and the problems will become less and less [wd3,6-] .

But I would be much obliged if the appointment could be made instead from 1st September, 1997, [sn9,-]  to 31st August, 1999 because I intent [fm1,-]  to complete [np7,-4]  work in translation and compilation already in progress in London.       Thanks again for the offer of appointment.  I hope that my work in London will be of great benefit to me and to the Institute in any teaching, translation, interpretation or compilation work I may be called upon to do.     I should be great [wd2,3-1]  pleased to receive your prompt answer.

<ST 5><SEX 2><Y 8><SCH Zhongda><AGE 20><WAY 1><DIC 1><TYP 2>                Study Problems    Although students have been studying all along in their previous time, most of them still meet with some problems in their study [np6,1-] .  To [pp2, -2]  my view, there are four main problems existing in the study.  First, the students lack interests in their study [np6,1-] .  Sometimes the  major courses they chose are not their favourite ones. They chose them, maybe, because of the fashion [wd3,7-]  or the wishes of their parents.  Thus, they study inactively and can't learn well.  If one can be interested in what he learns, he will be more positive and patient.  Second, the students are too shy and coward to ask questions which they have.  They think it's a shame to ask the teachers or classmates questions, especially in class and it indicates that they're stupid in front of the classmates.  But if the questions or problems can not be solved in time, they will accumulate more and more and the students will have more doubts in their study [np6,1-] .  Third, some students can't be engrossed in study. They  cannot concentrate their minds on the lessens [fm1,-]  in class which makes them hard to grasp the meaning of what the teachers say. [sn8,s]   Finally, some students are not painstaking enough. With the hope [np2,2-4]  to take part in the curricular   [wd3,8-8]  activities, they find that studying is very dull and boring.  So they give up studying but to play  [vp4,6-] , which wastes them a lot of time.    Of course, there are some other problems except [wd3,5-3]  these above mentioned [wd1,3-]  existing in students' studying.  In short, students should see and know the problems they meet with in study and then deal with them seriously.  Only in this way can they make some progress.

Having been a student for over fourteen years. I still have study problems, especially when I came to university. [sn8,s]        Since my major is English, I have to spend a lot of time to memorize the new words and expressions of this foreign language. It is very difficult to use the new words freely shortly after I memorize them.  That is the first problem.  Second, majors in English seldom have chances to learn the knowledge [cc3,3-]  in other fields.  My knowledge of science, economy, medicine is very limited not only in English but in Chinese.  I have to take the economic [wd3,2-1]  lectures and learn to use [np7,1-1]  computer in order to gain more knowledge and keep up with the society.  I have to make full use of the evening [np6,5-3]  and the weekends to study other knowledge [cc3,3-]  because the compulsory courses have occupied the whole daytime.  The third is that I become less interested in studying since some courses are rather boring.  I can hardly concentrate on the textbook while I am bored.  It really does harm to my studies.     I always ask myself: How can I solve these problems?  Never can I get the answer.  In my opinion, they are too common to solve; however, so long as I can arrange time correctly and force myself to study soul and heart [np2,3-] , I could make these problems less harmful to my studies.

I should like to make [wd3,4-7]  the appointment from 1st September, 1997, [sn9,-]  to 31st August, 1999 because I wish to complete work in translation and compliation [fm1,-]  already in progress in London.

In the following paragraphs, I will discuss three of these problems.    Firstly, I still have some difficulty in writing.  When I write an essay, I alway [fm1,-]  think in [np7,1-2]  Chinese way. For example, when I want to express the idea "the No.3 classroom building", I will express it as "the No.3 teaching building".  I am not sure how to use the expression of standard English, which is the major problem in my writing.  Secondly, I don't know how to memorize new words efficiently. I have formed a habit of reviewing new words after class, but several days later, after I finish learning that lesson, I can't remember those words which I had reviewed.  Thirdly, how to improve my oral English is also one of my study problems.  A lack of oppotunity [fm1,-]  is a problem hard to solve.    In short, concerning writing, word study and speaking, I have some problems.  I hope I can find solutions to these problems in the future studying.

I accept the offer of appointment, but in order to complete [np7,-5]  work in translation and compilation already in progress in London, I have to make a request that the appointment be made instead from 1st September, 1997, [sn9,-]  to 31st August, 1999. Thank you for your offer of appointment.  Hoping that  my work in London will be of great benefit not only to me but also to the institute in any teaching, translation, interpretation, or compilation work I may be called upon to do.

<ST 5><SEX 2><Y 8><SCH Zhongda><AGE 21><WAY 1><DIC 1><TYP 2>                                             Study Problems     Nowadys [fm1,-]  the strange and the new occur dayly [fm1,-] and monthly.  Accordingly, as human beings in the society, we can't stop studying the new knowledge [cc3,4-] , or we will not catch up with others and the society.     First, we should make our aim for studying clear.  Some people study just for [np7,1-2]  entrance examination. Some people study for [wd3,3-1]  study.  Some people study for their parents.  All of these are not good motivations which can spur us to study readily [wd3,6-] .  A good goal in studying is to improve our abilities and to adapt to the rapid-advancing [fm2,-]  society.  We can't study actively until we realize this point. Second, we should study to apply our knowledge but not just study.[sn,s].   There are enough examples which show some high-scored students turn out to be usefuless [fm2,-]  in practice.  On the contrary, some students with low score [np6,4-]  present their abilities in their work.  This fact demonstrates the score is not the only standard that classifies the [wd5,-2]  people's abilities. So we should focus our major energy in [wd3,4-]  learning how to apply our knowledge in stead of getting high mark [np6,9-]  in examination [np6,11-] .    In a word, as long as we study permanently [wd3,2-] , we can be winners in the world.  And if all the Chinese realize it, our country will become strong and rich soon.

<ST 5> <SEX 2> <Y 8> <SCH Zhongda> <AGE 20> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1>     Intensive reading is the main subject of  English major [np6,8-] .  Having studied for one year,  I come to realize the importance of learning intensive reading well.  It concerns not only my academic record, but also my ability of using English.  I reckon the textbook used last term is not bad, because the content  is rather practical -- unit one provides us with different types of practical writings, unit [np6,-3]  two and three also inform us of some knowledge [cc3,4-]  on different aspects of western social life.  So, as the new term is coming, I expect that I can go on to learn [vp5,3-]  practical knowledge [cc3,2-]  in intensive reading course.  Moreover, I expect that the reading material's [np4,2-1]  selection will be new.  I find that the writing time signed at the end of the articles is usually about 80's [wd7,-].  This makes many students consider the reading materials as something  out of date.  Why should the authority not choose some latest articles as texts to appeal to the youth?  Acquiring more knowledge of western cultures and erlarging [fm1,-]  my vocabulary are also  my expectation [np6, 13-] .    Now, we have had our intensive reading course for almost half a month.  Something turns out to be unexpected.  Initially, I find I must spend a lot of time on preparing for the new lesson. Numerous new words and aids to preview require more time and more energy.  Then, when I finish the labour [wd3,4-3]  on the text, there are a number of boring and thorough exercises waiting for me.  But one thing which is worth mentioning is I'm definitly [fm1,-]  impressed after doing the exercises.  The teaching methods also come unexpecting [vp5,5-2]  to me.  The teacher is very patient and enthusiastic, her detailed analysises [fm2,-]  and rigorous requirements make the studying atmosphere lively and forceful [cc4,3-] .   It is a great help for me to learn intensive reading well.  What more [sn2,2-s] , the texts are mainly about  literature, not so practical as those of last term.  Big theme needs more comprehension.      Overall, I prefer the learning way of this term to the way of last term, although it is really not an easy task for me to get over.  

<ST 5> <SEX 2> <Y 8> <SCH Zhongda> <AGE 20> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 2>               Mama, I Love You     The train bound for Guangzhou is rushing with [pp2,1-3]  a high speed.  Sitting in the train,  I stare at [pp1,1-10]  the window.   The view outside the window changes so fast that it becomes vague.  Vague, all become [vp3,1-1]  vague.  Only mother's figure, short, a little fat, standing alone on the platform and looks so weak from a far [cc4,2-1]  distance, is getting clearer and clearer.      A pop British band called "Spice Girl" has sung a song.  "Mama, I love you".  The song is released around Mother's Day, and many of my fellow students said they'd been moved by this special song.  But I can't see the differences between Spice girl's other pop works and this one.  I can't image how I can speak out these four words, facing my  mother.  Mother has never kissed me on the forehead to say good night, never fondled my head to have a heart-to-heart talk with me in whisper and never given me a hug to show she's unwilling to part with me.  She is only a plain middle-aged woman, fugal [fml1,-], hard-working, sometimes bad-tempered.      My first year in university has fled away with my connivance of [pp1,1-1]  myself, also with a high cost on diversion.  Mother is very anxious with the way I spend my money.    From the beginning of my summer holiday, she began to question me and check me.     "Why did you spend your money so quickly?"     "You must have gone out and hung around every weekend"  "You've never taken my words in, if you go on like this, I won't give you one more penny!"   Good heavens! I have tried my best to save every penny, only sometimes I can't resist the temptation of fashionable dress [np6,4-3]  and delicious food; and most diversion  [wd3,2-7] of my weekends is going to library.   Whereas [cj1,-s] , Mother won't believe in me.  The night at the end of the summer holiday, I slept with Mother.  In the darkness, Mother turned round, facing me.  I expected that she would say something with care and kindness.  Then, Mother spoke in a gentle voice.  "Irene, you should not spend your money...... " I almost screamed.   "Could you say something else?!"  I shouted, covering my head with the quilt.     Returning to school, the awful memory about money has nearly faded away.  At a dusk, I received the phonecall [fml2, -] from Mother.  When I picked up the phone, the first sound was her rough scolding.  "Where have you hung [vp6,3-4]  out all these days?!" "Take care of your money, remember what I have told you! "  Even not a word  mentioning my study, my daily life.  Diving [wd3,-7] from my domitary [fm1,-]  on the third floor, I was exciting [vp5,2-6]  and eager to hear Mother's voice. But now, all have [vp3,1-3]  been cooled [vp7,3-1]  down.  My heart sank to below zero degree in Mother's scolding.  I couldn't say and didn't want to say anything, just listened, then put down the receiver. That night, I wrote a letter to Mother desperately, saying she concerned only money, but not me .     Mid-Autumn [fm3,-]  Festival past  [wd2,2-] without Mother's phonecall [fml2,-]. Following [wd3,-4]  comes the National Day.  I've written to Mother to tell her that I will be back in the vacation.  But until the night before the National Day,  I haven't got the ticket yet.  Cannot [wd3,-10]  decide wheather [fml1,-] to go or to stay, I phoned Mother.   In my anxiety, the wire past [wd2,2-3]   Mother's cheerful voice  onto [pp1,4-2]  my ear. "Irene, where are you? I have cooked a big jar of soup, waiting for you. You've mentioned in your letter that you will be back today, right?  What's going on?"     "It's too bad.  I can't get the ticket.  Do you want me to  back home, Mama?"     "Want you to back [wd2,3-1]  home?  It's up to you.  I've kept many mooncakes, your most [wd5,-2]  favourite ones. If you don't come back, nobody can eat them up."     This is the way that [wd3,4-5]  my mother shows her feelings, using the most casual words to express her deepest hope:[sn9,-]   A warm stream flew into my heart.  Mother wasn't angry with me, although she had received the letter which I'd regretted delivering.  Just at that moment, the desire of going home became so strong that I  thought I must go home, no matter what kind of trouble I might come across.     "Well, Mama, one of my classmates wants to travel in our hometown, perhaps she will go home with me..."      "Oh, that's great! Don't worry, I'll prepare everything for you."     The next day, my friend and I struggled in the crowd at Guangzhou railway [fm3,-]  station [fm3,-] , fought our ways to get on the train, suffered four  hours of standing in the packed train and got off at Lechang  railway [fm3,-]  station [fm3,-]  in the end.  I don't know  how to describe my complex feelings as I saw mother [fm3,-] ,it is a mixture of pride, happiness, relaxation and exhaustion. [sn1,s] In the  following days, Mother cooked all kinds of delicious food for us, instructed us about the travelling route and bought daily necessities for me to bring back to school.  It was in late autumn,  but when I got up one morning, mother [fm3,-]  was carrying a big watermelon back home.  "Very fresh!" she said, with sweat on her forehead.  Mother enjoys singing Karaoka [fm1,-] , it surprised me that she seldom sang when we were in relative's home. She always asked me to sing with my cousin.  Once when I was singing, I happened to turn round and caught sight of my mother, who sat quietly far away from us, narrowing her eyes and staring at the screen because of farsightedness,  her wrinkled face disclosing her tiredness.  Suddenly, tears rushed to my eyes.  Mother is not young any more. The suffering in life has robbed her of health, comfort and happiness.  And I, is [vp3,1-4]  all of her hope and the one she cares most. However, when my vacation is over, mother will  be lonely again.     The train is rushing on, carrying me away from home farther and farther.  I can't control myself  any more.  Burying my head in arms, I let the streams of tears crawl over my cheek [np6,9-] .  Spice Girl's song is aroused [wd3,4-3]  in my heart.  "Mama, I love you. Mama, I care..."  It is such a beatiful [fm1,-]  song.  I know, from now on, my heart will never be apart with Mother's.      

<ST 5> <SEX 2> <Y 8> <SCH Zhongda> <AGE 20> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1>                  The Final Words of the Defense Lawyer Your Excellency,    In my conclusive announcement [wd3,3-s] , I'd like to appeal to you to make a verdict [np1,1-6]  that the boy is not guilty.  Following [np7,-9]  is the reasonable doubt which shows the boy innocent.     Let's start with the evidence -- the switch knife, which is stabbed into the boy's father's chest.  According to Juror No. 8's proof, the strange switch knife can be bought in a little junk shop in the boy's neighbourhood.  It is not the only one which is sold in the neighbourhood store.  As to the downward angle of the stab wound, it is not strong enough to prove that the boy has done  it.  As we know, the boy is raised in a slum and he was even picked up for knife fighting, so he is experienced on [pp1,1-2]  using knife [np7,2-] .  However, anyone who's ever used a switch knife will use it underhanded, but not stab downward.      And secondly, there is something out of logic with the old man's testimony.  The old man said he had heard the boy scream out "I'm going to kill you", and the sound of a body falling a second later.  But the EL gives out awful noises [np5,5-]  when it goes by, how can the old man hear the words?  The old man's testimony also conflicts with the woman's testimony, on the point of the time the murder occuring [fm1,-] [sn7,5-]  .  According to the woman's evidence, she saw the murder through the window of the EL's last two cars, that means the EL shall go by the old man's window for at least six seconds  before the body fell, but the old man said he heard the body fall a second after the boy's words -- if he really had heard the boy's words, he shall hear [vp8,10-1]  it before the EL goes [vp6,15-1]  by.  Moreover, there are some doubts on the boy's words "I'm going to kill you", according to the old man's testimony.  Since the boy is not well-educated,  it is impossible for him to shout out a standard English sentence at the emotional time,if a person really wants to kill someone and has prepared a knife for it, he won't prefer to crying [vp5,4-1]out his intention at the top of his lunge [fm1,-]. [sn1,s]        Finally, let's get down to the woman's testimony.  The woman said she saw the murder while she was turning and tossing.  And she was sure what she had seen, because she had worn glasses.  But no people wear glasses to bed.  It is even impossible that the woman wore her glasses after she noticed something happening in the boy's father's room, for the last two cars of the EL passed her windows in two senconds [fm1,-]  and after that [pr3,-2]  two senconds [fm1,-] , nothing can [vp6,20-5]  be seen in the darkness.  So, if the woman did see something, she saw only a blur.   Sorry, I almost forget a detail about the male witness -- the detail seems so unimportant that perhaps you've already forgottn [fm1,-]  it as I do.  Meanwhile, it does provide us with useful information.  That is the old man said he ran to the door to see the boy running downstairs after fifteen seconds as he heard the body falling.  It is evident that the old [wd4, 2-10]  is crippled and confused half the time, how can he walk to the door with two canes [wd3,6-]  in such a short time and be positive about the exact time? Our junors [fm1,-]  have already proved he can not act as he said in fifteen minutes.     The above is my final words on this case.  I appeal to  the judge to anounce [fm1,-]  that the boy is not guilty.     Thank you.  

<ST 5> <SEX 2> <Y 8> <SCH ZHDA> <AGE 19> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 2>           Our Spring Festival     [np7,-2]  Spring Festival is the most festive time of the year in Chinese calendar.  People celebrate the arrival of [np7,-3]  lunar New Year in various activities.      The spirit of [np7,-2]  Spring Festival arrives usually ten days before the festival itself.  Street lights and store windows are decorated  with the traditional Spring Festival color of red.  Red is a  symbol of happiness and booming to [np7,9-1]  Chinese.  People hang up red lanterns, stick red couplets on gate posts, and stick potraits [fm1,-]  of Chinese Gods on doors, etc. after a thorough cleaning of their houses.     Everything takes on a new look as [np7,-2]  Spring Festival comes.  On New Year's Eve, the Chinese family all get together and have a feast meal [wd5,2-]  -- chicken, fish, dumpling...., then they all stay up to wait for the new year to come.  When the clock strikes twelve, firecrackers and fireworks decorate the sky.  The nation is in great triumph.      On New Year's Day, everyone is wearing new hats, clothes, shoes and stockings.  Young children receive lucky money in red packages from their parents and relatives.  The families  pay new year calls to each other and whoever they meet they wish each other [pr1,7-3]  a good year.  Pleasant new year songs fly out of house and fill the Spring Festival atmosphere.  People sing, dance...they are nice and happy.       [np7,-2]  Spring Festival, actually, lasts until the lunar January 15th.  Though there are variations of traditional customs in different parts of the country, some are most popular, such as visiting relations [wd3,3-3] , keeping lights on all day and all night, eating the food that has a luckily-sound name...    Since [np7,-2]  Spring Festival is considered the real beginning of a new year by most of the Chinese people, it's regarded as the most promising time of a  year.  A good festival is a promise of a good year.  After all kinds of celebrations, Chinese people begin to work hard for the realization of  a more wonderful year.     

<ST 5> <SEX 2> <Y 8> <SCH Zhongda> <AGE 20> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1>         Language Study and Science Study      Language and science have many different features as two different subjects.  As we all know, science is the research of nature rules.  It has a close connection with observation, comparison and experiments.  Much of the scientists'  time is spent in laboratories.  However, if you want to learn language, you can never do that, as language is for communication.   You must spend as much time as possible to talk.  Different subjects require different learning methods, so we must have different ways to learn language and science.      People often say that language is not only a science, but an art as well.  This shows another difference between language and science.  Science is exact, accurate, and objective.  Once a true natural law is discovered, it can be applied to in [wd5, 5-2]  many situations without changing.  But language has more social elements and more skills are implied in it as it is used .    Different cultures may have completely different  understandings about a certain sentence.  Therefore, when we are learning language we should not only learn the language itself, but also the cultural background, such as customs, traditions....      Since language is also a science, it has many similarities with science.  Both language and science are an endless world for us to explore, so those who want to learn well in language should be as active and willing as when they study science.  Pessive [fm1,-]  study will certainly lead to failure in both subjects.     As we can see from the learning process of Scudder in our  text, science study needs observation and comparison.  It's also important in learning language. We should learn to find the similarities and differences between two languages, not only the vocabulary, but also the grammar, the cultural background.  Both subjects can't be independent of observation and comparison.    In a word, since both "language study" and "science study" are "study", they have methods in common; and as they belong to different study catogory [fm1,-] , we should find the suitable method for each . 

<ST 5> <SEX 2> <Y 8> <SCH Zhongda> <AGE 20> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 2>      A Character Sketch of Galileo      Galileo was born in Pisa, Italy, in 1564. As a boy, he showed a scientific talent: observant, curious, and non-conformable [fm2,-] . As he grew up, his desire of probing the mystery of the things  became more and more intense, [sn1,-s] his dissatisfaction with what the authority ordered to obey became stronger and stronger. After he entered the University of Pisa, Galileo became more active to testify his hypothesis with experiments and he was brave enough to  challenge  the great Aristotle.  Although he was considered an idiot and a heretic, he just turned a deaf ear to such "criticism and  dedicated himself to the pursuit of truth.  After he went to Padua, where the intellectual air [wd3,2-6]  was much more freer [aj3,1-2]  than Piza, Galileo reached the height of [wd4,4-1] life.  All his life Galileo invented a lot of things (for example, the compass, the thermometer and the telescope) and discovered many nature laws (such as the Theory of Falling Objects, the isochronism of Pendulum) .  Actually  Galileo was a follower of Copernicans and he dared to declare there are spots in the sun.      In the atmosphere of [np7,-2]  Middle Ages, Galileo was just like a shining star in the dark sky.  His contribution was bejond [fm1,-]  comparison.  Yet just as the sun also has spots, Galileo was not perfect.  From a critical point of view, Galileo should have  achieved more if he hadn't made the deadly decision to return to Pisa, where the power of Inquisition was very strong.  However , with an eagerness to return in triumph to his hometown and to show how injust [fm2,-]  they had treated him, Galileo returned to Pisa brashly.  Soon he suffered the consequence of his decision -- He was oppressed, summoned and deprived of the basic rights by the Inquisition and finally was sentenced to death.  Psychologically speaking, Galileo's mind was not broad enough so that he sacrificed his career for the [np7,5-1] fame.       Yet it was really difficult for Galileo to break through the dense nets made by the authority of his times.  He deserved the respect and memorial [wd3,5-5]  from all over the world.  In my opinion, he is not only a great scientist, but also a brave warrior.

"I promise I won't go to work, just go back to have a look at our house and land."  Grandma continued her request.    "Don't argue any more.  I know you, Mum.  Next time, let's go back together."     Often do I hear such a conversation.  At first I think Dad is too authoritative.  Why not let Grandma do what she wants?  But by and by, I understand Dad.  He knows Grandma as well as loves her.    Grandma is over seventy now.  She has spent almost all the time on the land, farming for the whole family.  As our life is improving, Father wants Grandma to stop working and enjoy life in the city.  However, Grandma won't rest and "enjoy".  She is always trying to do as much housework as she could.  "Let me do it."  is her favourite words.     "Grandny [fm1,-] , come here and watch television.  The programme is wonderful."  I called Grandma who was washing the dishes in the kitchen.     "OK, wait until I finish, dear granddaughter."    Ten minutes passed.  "Grandny [fm1,-] , have a rest."  I called again.   "Thank you.  But look at the floor.  It's a little dirty.  I'll mop it first."     Such is Grandma, always finding things to keep herself  busy.   However, as she grows old, she isn't as strong as before.  Three times she met with small accidents while she was at the countryside.   Once she even broke her leg when she tried to climb up a mountain to collect some dry branches, and that's why after that Father would not let Grandma go home alone.   "Grandny [fm1,-] , you've worked hard all your life. Why not rest and enjoy life?"     Grandma stroked me with her wrinkled hands, "dear [fm3,-]  girl, I've been used to using my hands all the time.  I feel so uncomfortable when I rest my hands.  And, "she added, "I like to do things for you."    "But, Grandny [fm1,-] , we hope that you can live a happy and free life."     "I know you are all good children.  Never mind, I'm still strong.  I just cannot keep my hands free."     "cannot [fm3,-]  keep my hands free", that's my Grandmother.

Dear Ms Chen,      With reference to your advertisment [fm1,-]  in China Daily of Oct. 3, 1997, I should like to apply for a secretary job [wd5,4-] , as you offer in your company.    My name is Pan Xiaoyan, 19 years old.  Having just graduated from Zhongshan University as an English major, I can speak fluent English and write good English articles.  I also obtain a computer certification.  I'm sure I can meet the requirement p6,4-3]  of a secretary in your company.    I've got some experience of secretary work when I was  still at the university.  I took a part-time job as a secretary for an import & export company.  The company was satisfied with my effort and I think this gives me an advantage [np1,4-3]  among the candidates.     I'm enclosing a Personal Data sheet.  If this satisfies you, please contact me as soon as possible.                                                                  Yours sincerely,                                                                 Pan Xiaoyan                                                                      

<ST 5> <SEX 2> <Y 8> <SCH Zhongda> <AGE 20> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1>                    Is The boy Guilty or Not?      There is an important principle that the criminal court must eliminate any reasonable doubt to confirm the defendant's crime. Among the several proofs listed by the prosecution, reasonable doubts will be found.       The lethal weapon is the knife.  The boy admits going to a neighbourhood store and buy [vp4,9-2]  this knife, but he also says he must have lost it on the way home.  The prosecutor considers it a lie just because the store keeper said that the knife was the only one kind he had.  Actually, it can be easily found.  Look at this one.  I got it last night in a little junk shop around the corner from the boy's house. Therefore, the boy may have not lied.     Now let's come to the first witness's testimony.  The old man said he heard the boy yell, "I'm going to kill you."  A second later he heard the father's body falling.  And he saw the boy running out of the house fifteen seconds after that.  However, the second witness -- the woman across the street -- said that she saw the boy stab his father through the open window of a moving elevated train.  Now let's pay our attention to the time. How long does it take an elevated train going at top speed to pass a given point?    About ten seconds, or two seconds per hour.  Remember the woman saw the killing through the windows of the last two cars, which means that the EL train had been going by the old man's window for at least 6 seconds before the body fell.  Imagine the awful noise made by the passing train.  Do you believe that such an old man could hear the boy's shouting in such a condition?     Suppose the old man did hear it, now let's continue to see [wd3,4-1] his words.  He said he saw the boy running out of the house 15s [fm2,-]  later.  A man who can only walk very slowly with two canes is able to cover forty-three feet within 15s [fm2,-] , can we imagine?  A judicial test will show whether it's possible or not. (Perform  test) As we all see, it's absolutely not true.  Thus I think that the old man only heard someone running down the stairs and assumed it was the boy.  He lied in the court.     The second witness -- the woman seems to have given a more important evidence, because she said she "saw" the murder.  At about 12:10 when she was turning and tossing.  Let me remind you of the facts:  The woman is near-sighted and no one wears glasses in bed, true?  How can a woman with poor eyesight see clearly what's happening in another house across the tracks?     From the  above reasoning, the witnesses'  testimonies can not be used as the evidence of the murder.  Apart from it, there is another point about the stab wound -- the downward angle.  The boy is five feet eight inches tall while his father was six two.  The different [wd2,1-5]  of 6 inches in height makes it very hard to stab into the chest of the taller one.  There must be another person who is taller than the boy's father that had killed him.    The boy is not guilty, though he has been kicked around all his life, though he may hate his father.  The strong facts before us show that the boy didn't commit the crime. 

<ST 5> <SEX 2> <Y 8> <SCH Zhongda> <AGE 19> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 2>                     An Old Man      He is the strangest man I've ever seen.     When I was four years old, one day, my mother brought me a picture book after work.  I was attracted to the colourful pictures at once.  My mother told  me that it was Uncle Chen who had given me the book.       From then on, I often received some picture-books and story-books sent by Uncle Chen.  I loved those books.  First, my mother told me the stories on them.  Little by little, I began to learn the characters through the stories.  But I had never seen Uncle Chen for he lived far away from my home.  Only now and hen my mother told me something about him.       Uncle Chen is my mother's workmate.  He is an engineer.  Nearly eighty as he is, he still works in the factory.  He is a learned, warm-hearted but very serious man.  He can't bear a tiniest mistake in his work.  He was very strict with [wd3,4-2]  his disciples, so they are a bit afraid of him but all respect him.  In fact, the work done by his group is always excellent.  On the other hand , people think [vp1,1-4]  him a strange man.     Firstly, he has gone beyond in retiring age, but he  was [vp6,9-4]  still working very hard.  He has said that he won't quit until he can't work any longer.  Secondly, he earns a pretty good salary, but he leads a very simple, maybe we should say, a miserly life. He spends most of his money on books, magazines and newspapers.  Thirdly, he isn't married and    consequently has no children, but he always sends books to his workmates' children freely.  I am one of the lucky children.  From the first picture-book fifteen years ago to the latest English Salon a week before [wd3,14-] , I've read considerable [aj1,2-3]  books and magazines from him.     I remember very well the first time I visited Uncle Chen three years ago.  It is [vp6,8-3]  a small room no longer than twelve square metres.  When I went into it, I found myself enter a world of books.  Three big bookshelves, the desk, the boxes under the bed and even half of the bed were all filled with books.  He recieved [fm1,-]  me warmly.  He inquired how I got on with my study.  When I told him that I was interested in English and was going to do further study of it in University, it seemed to please him.  He himself studied English in Yanjing University  when he was young.  Then, he began to tell his story.     He was born in an influential family.  His father was a superior officer of the Kuomindang government, while he was influenced by the progressive ideas.  When he graduated from university, he left his family and took part in the revolution.  After liberation [fm3,-]  he entered the university a second time and studied mechanics, then became an engineer.  In the Cultural Revolution, his family background brought him persecution.  He was barred in a barn for ten years.  During the years, he read some books that he had hidden secretly.  It was books that helped him go through those hardest days.  Only when he came to my mother's factory in the 80's could he continue his work and study.  He said to me, "Some people think I'm a bit foolish.  They don't understand why I keep on working instead of enjoying the days I have left me [sn8,s-].  And since I am quite old now, it seems unworthy to spend so much money on books.  You know that he Cultural Revolution has [vp6,6-4]  taken me ten years.  I feel lucky that I could go through it, moreover, I still have the ability to work now, so why shouldn't I work harder to make up for the lost ten years[sn1,s]love books and one is never too old to learn.  I give books to children because I hope they will love books and realize the importance of books too.   Remember: You young people is [vp3,3-5]  the future of the country.  It is very important for you to learn as much as possible, then you can serve the country."  Hearing his words, I came to understand him. I saw a noble soul.     He is the man I respect very much.
  
<ST 5> <SEX 2> <Y 8> <SCH Zhongda> <AGE 19> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1>                     The Defence by the Boy's Lawyer       According to the two witnesses'  testimonies, now we have been informed that an old man living under the boy's house heard the boy say to his father, "I'm going to kill you."  , then the body falling [vp5,3-] , then he saw  the boy running down the stairs and out of the house; at the same time, a woman living across from [wd5,4-3]  the boy's house saw the boy stab his father through the windows of a pass [vp5,1-2]  EL train.  In addition, the boy admits [vp6,2-12]  he bought a knife just like the one stuck into his father.  So my client, the boy is accused of murdering his father.  Since "Guilty beyond a reasonable doubt" is a principle of our American system of criminal court, now I'd like to state some reasonable doubts to  prove that my client is innocent.     First, the old man says he heard the boy say to his father, "I'm going to kill you.", a second later the body falling [vp5,2-] . [sn1,s] According to the woman's testimony, the whole thing happens [vp6,8-]  during [pp1,-5]  the EL train passing through.  People who live near the EL tracks know that when the window is open and the train goes by, the noise is awful.  So it is impossible for the old man to hear what the boy says and the  body falling [vp5,9-]  with the EL  noise. Suppose he did hear it.  I'm sure all of us have said "I'll kill you." for many times.  When we say this, certainly it doesn't mean we're really going to kill someone.  So the phrase cannot mean anything.  Further more [fm2,-] ,the old man says he ran to the door and saw the boy rush out of the house fifteen seconds after the killing.  Let's see the drawing [wd3,3-3]  of the apartment. The old man was in bed.  It's twelve feet from his bed to the bedroom door and the hall is forty-three feet, six inches long, i.e., he had to walk about fifty feet from his bed to the door. Don't forget the old man is over seventy and there is something wrong with his legs, which makes him walk very slowly.  Can such an old man do all of that in fifteen seconds?  Obviously he can't. So I can say that the old man has lied in court and his testimony is unbelievable.      Secondly the woman right across the street says that she saw he boy stick the knife into his father.  It was at night and she was lying in bed, unable to sleep because it was hot.  We have proved that one can look through the windows of a passing EL train at night and see what's happening on the other side, but remind you, the woman has bad eye sight, she has to wear her glasses to see things clearly. [sn1,s] We all know that no one wears glasses to bed.  So without her glasses, the woman couldn't see the boy kill his father.  What she saw was only a blur.     Last, although the boy admits [vp6,2-2]  he bought a same d3,3-5]  knife as the lethal weapon, in fact, no other evidence proves they are one knife. [sn1,s] Since the boy can buy it from a store, someone else also [ad1,2-2]  can buy this kind of knife from other stores.     According to the three doubts above, I should say the boy is innocent.  

<ST 5> <SEX 2> <Y 8> <SCH Zhongda> <AGE 20> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 2>         The Essence of New Year     Today is December 31th [fm2,-] , the New Year's Eve.  All the students were free and relaxing [vp5,6-] .  At supper, my roomates talked about how to spend this night.  As usual, they might go back home or appoint [wd3,6-3]  her boy friend, or gather with her fellow-men or familiar friends.  So, after supper, they were all out.     With the purpose of visiting my former classmates, I went to Dormitory East 11.  When I passed the No.5 students' dinging-room, I saw many students going into there.  There were long queues in front of the selling-windows [fm2,-] .  For I wanted some breads [np5,3-]  for midnight, I went in.  The sellers were all busy.  They did their sellings as quickly as possible.  But the students were so many that they couldn't deal with it.     It occured [fm2,-]  to me suddenly that idea [wd5,6-] : why not come to help them?  I went into the selling-room and said to a female seller: "I'd like to assist [vp1,3-5]  you to sell the pastry. Can I? "  She got a shock and thought I might tease p6,8-1]  her.  However, assistance was really needed .  She accepted me.  Firstly and quickly [ad1,2-8] , she told me the price of different pastry and how to operate the Dolden [fm1,-]  Dragon Card machine.  Then, I  stood behind a window.   When a student stood in front of the selling-window and told me what he wanted, I'd pack [vp6,16-2]  the food with a plastic bag. And then I'd count [vp6,2-2]  [wd3,1-2]  the price and get the payment from his Golden Dragon Card  by pressing the IC card Machine [fm3,-] .  That's all the process.  It's not difficult but mechanizational [fm1,-] .  I did it again and again.  At the beginning I was a little clumsy.  By and by I became skillful.  The long queue was shorter.  The other sellers praised me  with delighting expression [np6,-3]  in their eyes.     Having serived [fm1,-]  one and another customer, I was filled with the satisfaction and happiness occured [fm2,-]  by labour.  I still remembered tonight [wd3,3-5]  was the New ear's Eve.  I tried to send my wishes to all the people.     Now a girl was  standing infront [fm2,-]  of my window. I smiled and said :"Hellow [fm1,-] , what would you like to have?" The girl said: "Two eggs. A piece of cake." ok [fm3,-] , just a minute." I packed them into a bag  quickly and handed it to her. After I pressed the key on the I.C. card machine, I said to her: "Wish you a happy New Year.  Have a wonderful  night !"  The girl was surprised and couldn't find [vp2,1-2]  her voice at that moment. I nodded to her and said:   "See you!"  Surprisedly [fm1,-]   and happily she left.   "That is good." I said to myself, "I must go on." Another girl was here. After I pressed the key, I said:" Wish you a happy new year.  Have a wonderful night!"  She grinned." Thank you.  You too. " Again, she left happily and surprisedly [fm1,-] .     Sending my wishes to everyone with my services, I did it again and again delightedly.  The other sellers were infected from my behavour [fm1,-]  and gradually smiled to the customers. A warm, cordial atmosphere filled the dinning-room [fm1,-] .     At last, time's [vp6,2-1]  up.  Having said "Happy New Year to each seller, I went out of the dinning-room [fm1,-]  with cluster [wd3,-2]  of thanks from the sellers.  I was tired but happy.  This Eve was a most instructive Eve, because I understood the essence of new year: sending assistance and wishes to everyone!     I looked up and saw what a starry night it was.  It seemed that the stars were smiling and blinking to me.     "Happy New Year."  I spoke to myself softly.

When he entered Pisa University Medicine Department, he put his heart in Mathematics and experiments, for he was interested in  [np7,4-3] science of astronomy.     When his theory was met with other Professors' criticisms and students' sneerness [fm2,-] , he paid no attention to it [pr1,17-] , for he had the [np7,2-3]  confidence on [wd3,4-2]  his discovery.     When the chair of Mathemetics [fm1,-]  with low salary was vacant, he accepted the position, for it's [vp6,6-3]  convenient for his research.     When he was forced to leave [wd4,6-1]  hometown and stayed at Padua University, he kept his study and published many treatises on science, for he could never stop pursuing the truth.       When he was persecuted by the Inquisition, he didn't give in and give up his pursuit, for he believed in the faith which he got from science.     He's a man with hight [fm1,-]  spirits and strong will on science research.  He had devoted himself to it and contributed a lot to it for he was always persevering[wd3,-] for  his goal and worked hard.    He's Galileo.

<ST 5> <SEX 2> <Y 8> <SCH Zhongda> <AGE 20> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1>                 The prosecutor testimony    In the following testimony,  I'll prove the boy, the suspect is guilty.     First, let's look at the boy's record.  He lives in a slum.  At fifteen he was in reform school .  He ever [wd5,1-3]  stole a car.  He's been picked up for knife fight.  The suspect's life is filled with bad records.     Secondly, let's go through the first witness, the old man's testimony.  The old man lives on the second floor under the room where the murder took place.  After twelve o'clock [wd5,2-1]  ten, he heard loud noises in the uper [fm1,-]  apartment.  It sounded like a fight.  The [fm1,-]  he heard the boy shouted to his father, "I'm going to kill you ."  A second later, he heard a body falling.  He ran to the door of his apartment and looked out.  He saw the boy running down the stairs and out of the house.  Then he called the police and found the father was knifed dead.     Thirdly, let's go through the second witness, the woman's testimony.  The woman lives across the stree [fm1,-] .  The boy's house-window [fm2,-]  is right across from hers.  There is an [np7,-2]  EL tracks between them.  The woman went to bed at about eleven o'clock that night.  Her bed was next to the open window. She could see right into [pp1,12-2]  the window.  She tossed about her sleep [cc3,3-]  over an hour. Finally she turned to the window at about twelve ten.  As she looked out, there was a train passing. The EL train had five cars.  Through the windows of the last two, the woman saw the boy stab his father.  And we had proven one can see through the window of a passing train and see the thing on [pp1,3-2]  the house across at night.     Finally, let's go to the important evidence. [sn9,-]   The flick knife.  The knife was stabbed into the father's chest.  Also, the boy admits going to the neighborhood store and buying the knife after being beaten by his father that night.  The storekeeper identified the knife and said it is [vp6,3-]  the only one of its kind he had.     So, from all above, we have enough evidence to prove the suspect is guilty.
   
<ST 5> <SEX 2> <Y 8> <SCH Zhongda> <AGE 20> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1>                                   After conducting a thorough cross-examination, please allow me to have a conclusive statement as defense lawyer.     Firstly, this knife is a pretty strong piece of evidence.  The boy admits buying a knife  like this in his neighbourhood after being bit [fm1,-]  by his father.  You may doubt whether this unusual knife is a present for a friend as the slum boy says?   But I easily got it in a little junk shop around the corner from the boy's house.  Since there's no fingerprint on it, it can't prove that this is the exact knife the boy uses to stab his father.    Sencondly [fm1,-] , the testimony of the old man is not so persuable [fm2,-] . As we know from our common sense, you can't hear yourself think because of the awful noise when your window is open and the train goes by.  So it's impossible for the old man to have heard the boy say "I'm going to kill you" while the front of the EL war [fm1,-]  roaring past his nose.     Another important point is time. The old man was positive that he got to his front door from his bed in 15 seconds. The hall of his house is 43 feet, six inches long. He had to get out of bed, get his canes, walked [vp5,10-]  twelve feet, open the bedroom door, walk forty-three feet, and open the front door to see what was happening.  Could anyone of you believe that it's possible for an old man who walks with 2 canes can do [vp5,12-]  all in 15 seconds[sn8,s-]? I think the old man was trying to get to the front door. He heard someone running down the stairs and assumed it was the boy.  He didn't witness it by his eye [wd5,7-] .     Let's go over the women's statement. The murder was taking place as she looked out of the window while tossing and turning in bed. She couldn't have time to put on her glasses in a second to see clearly who was the murderer.      To sum up, there are many contradictions in the evidence and the testimony. I don't think a wise verdict should be [wd5, 7-5]  result from these groundless evidence [np6,2-] . Every bright juriors [fm1,-], [np6,2-]  [fm1,-]  I'm sure you'll vote impatially [fm1,-]  without any prejudice of [pp1,6-3]  the innocent boy from the slum. We believe that law is fair and nobody innocent will be  verdicted [wd2,24-3]  to be [np7,7-1]  criminal.

<ST 5> <SEX 2> <Y 8> <SCH Zhongda> <AGE 20> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1>        The Learning of Science And Language      As a subject, the learning of science and the learning of language are quite different and have some similar characteristics as well. [sn8,s]   First of all, the contents are different.   If you study a subject of science, you should know the exact way in which a certain object move [vp3,8-] , the accurate fomula [fm1,-] , the outside and inside appearance and feature of the object etc.  If you study one language, you have to learn the culture background, the grammar rules and you must master the skills of reading, listening and writing of this language.  The most important thing is to communicate with this  language-speakers [np1,2-] .       Secondly, the ways of learning are different.  Learning a science, you must observe carefully, calculate accurately and do the experiments conscientiously.  To master a language, you should do listening, speaking and writing exercises as much as possible.  The environment is a significant factor to a language learner.  You should take all the opportunities to practise your language. A language learner has to communicate with others to improve himself while a science learner can learn all by himself.      Although the learning of science and language is quite differet [fm1,-] , as a course, they have some resemblances fm1,-].[sn8,s] To master knowledge, no matter it's science or language, you must practise as much as possible. Practice makes perfect.  If you practice more and are familiar with your subject, you can draw parallels from inference and make a rapid progress.    To sum up the resemblances [fm1,-]  and differences of the learning of science and language, we can draw a conclusion that science and language are incompatible, we can learn both of them well.

<ST 5> <SEX 2> <Y 8> <SCH Zhongda> <AGE 20> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 2>                  Character Sketch of Galileo      In Februry [fm1,-] , 1564, the great physicist, Galileo, was born in Pisa , Italy.  His  many achievements include the discovery of the isochronism [fm1,-] of the pendulum and the demonstration that the acceleration of a falling body does not depend on its weight.  He constructed the telescope, discovered Jupiter's satellites, observed sunspots and the mountainous nature of the moon.     Galileo was keen on observation when he was a little boy, and his curiosity about the world always couldn't [vp9,1-2]  be satisfied.  He never regarded [vp2,2-8]  what the [np7,4-6]  great man had said for granted, and he kept experimenting to test whether the theory was true or not.   This  led to his first discovery of the isochronism [fm1,-] of the pendulum when he was 19.     In my opion [fm1,-] , it was his disposition that led to Galileo's achievements and fate of his whole life.  He had 3 main character [np6,2-] . First of all, he was fearless.  It's  regarded as [vp2,2-10]  brash for Galileo, an obscure young prefessor [fm1,-] , to contradict Aristotle at that time.  Undaunted by the sneers of his students and the  wrath of the faculty, he managed to proved his theory of the falling object.  He never accepted what the Master said as authritative [fm1,-] .  Galileo could make so many discoveries.  Most of Galileo's discoveries were owned to his keeping questioning.     Galileo's second character was perseverance.  When his father beg [vp6,3-10]  Galileo to give up and obey his professor, Galileo put [vp2,1-6]  a deaf ears to the plea.  He continued his study although he met with jealousy and hatred, even though he was dismissed [sn6,s-] .  He made great achievements during his 18-year stay in the University of Padua. When he went back to Pisa, he never stopped his study in spite of the cruel persecution.       Galileo's vainity [fm1,-]  led to his tragedy in the rest of his life.  For years, he had longed for the day when he could return in triumph to Pisa.  He wanted to revenged [vp4,3-]  his fellow professors and gain  the respect and approval of his fellow citizens.  Knowing that he wouldn't get away with the persecution of the Inquisition, Galileo made the decision in spite of the warning of his friends.  If he had stayed in Padua, he would have made more achievements.  To go back to Pisa is the fatal mistake he made.    To sum up, it's tortuous [fm1,-]  for Galileo to make so great achievements.  His great  courage and perseverance of pursuing the truth are worth learning from.  No men [np6,1-2]  is infallible.  We will always remember Galileo as a great scientist who had contributed so much to the world.

Everyone said [vp6,1-6]  my mother is a happy wife.  My mother is a self-employed entrepreneur, she works out all day. [sn1,s] Father will prepare for each meal when he goes [wd3,8-3]  back from work.  He is not only a good cook but also a good gardener.  He is interested in cooking and planting in his spare time.  All our  relatives and friends who has [vp3,6-1]  tasted our dishes would sing high praise for father's dilicous [fm1,-]  cooking. Every dusk after dinner, Father will spend half an hour in our small balcony to take care of the flowers.  You can see different kinds of flowers and smell fragrant throught-out [fm1,-]   the year.   My father never smokes but drinks occasionally.  I am happy  I live in a fresh atmosphere [wd3,5-] .  Father helps Mother to calculate [cc3,-2]  some statistics of her business and gives advice at the right time.  Our family is well taken care [vp2, 5-2]  by Father so Mother can concentrate [vp1,-5]  herself to her owe  [fm1,-]  business.    My younger brother and I never lack of care of [wd3,9-1]  family.  Father never takes our education lightly.    Last year, when my brother began to study in middle school, he kept returning home late.  My parents were afraid that he would make friends with some bad youngsters.  But they couldn't know anything from my brother.  Why not follow him to see what he does and what kind  of people he makes friends with out of school?  My mother suggested.  She thought that's [vp6,2-3]  a direct way to know something.    "That's not a good way."  Father said seriously, "We should keep in touch with his teachers.  Parents and school should operate."     Then my father made a phone call to my brother's teacher and got some details of brother's performance in [pp2,2-1]  school.    One day, when [np7,-4]  four of our family sat around the table after dinner, Father said "Let's have a family talk.  What happened these days to our family?..."    "My children, you are getting old enough to deal with different situations by yourselves.  I have told you some examples of the complex society.  I have confidence that you can judge by yourselves what kind of people you should make friends with.  We don't want to interfere, but as your parents, we want to know more of our children.  Can you take your new friends home and introduce them to us?" "By the way, we hope you can return home on time because we would worry about you every night when you came back late.  Can you?"  Father said to brother.  After that, my brother would go back to home on time.     That's our respectful [wd3,2-1]  father -- common but great!

<ST 5> <SEX 1> <Y 8> <SCH Zhongda> <AGE 23> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1>      Differences on [wd3,1-1]  Study Between Language and Science    It's hard to say the difference directly. Let's set to the study of the distinctive features between them.  Language is the systerm [fm1,-]  of human expression by means of words, and science is a knowledge which depends on testing facts and stating general natural laws. So the ways to study  is [vp3,4-1] different.     If we want to study language very well, we'll set about listening, writing,  [wd4,4-1] speaking simultaneously. It is very important for us to practise these three kinds of abilities.  But studing [fm2,-]  science isn't as easy as language. Above all, people should have several qualities, such as patience, dedication, earnestness, enthusiasm, etc, because the research and the experiment is [vp3,5-2]  too dull and complicated. For example, after repeated experiments, radium was found.  After struggling against Aristotle's wrong idea, Galileo found the theory of "falling object".     By making a comparative study, we could see that language needs imitation, while science needs creation. If we create language, we'll be easy [wd3,2-3]  to make mistakes. Identically [sn9,-]  if we imitate science, we couldn't get progress [cc3,1-] . So science student [np6,1-3]  should have encouragement [wd3,5-]  to break down old ideas.     From the question professor [fm3,-]  Chang gave, I'm reminded again that it is easier to study language than science. I sure do learn it well. [sn8,s]   
 
<ST 5> <SEX 1> <Y 8> <SCH Zhongda> <AGE 23> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 2>                     The Character of Galileo     Galileo is a great scientist of Italy. The achievement that Galileo made can't be separated from his distinctive character.     First, he is observant and studious. When he was young, his insatiable curiosity made him experiment and devise tests constantly to probe the mystery of the world. Once, he listened to the persistent rattle of a chain unconsciously; [sn9,-]  and then he discovered an important principle through the regular swinging of an old lamp. Just such spirits led to his discovery.[sn8,s]    Second, Galileo is brave and defiant. In order to persuade wd3,-2]  scientific truths, he didn't care about the sneers of his students and the wrath of his fellow professors, even the threat of christian [fm3,-]  persecution. At the same time, he wasn't ready to confess [wd3,-1]  theories just because Aristotal [fm1,-]  said so. He dared to contradict Aristotal's [fm1,-]  wrong theory. Eventually he even risked his life publishing an astronomical book to support Copernicus'  theory. What he did demaged [fm1,-]  christian [fm3,-]  interest and the penalty that he got is [vp6,5-]  serious. Obviously, he dedicated himself to science. Therefore, without these characters, he can't [vp6,4-4]  stuggle [fm1,-]  against wrong idea [np6,1-]  and [np7,-2]  heartless pope [fm3,-]  fearlessly.    Evidently, Galileo's characters are very important factors for his success and great achievement. Before his death, he repeated his words. The persuit [fm1,-]  of science needs special bravery.      This is his real portrait.

<ST 5> <SEX 2> <Y 8> <SCH Zhongda> <AGE 20> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 2>      Spring-festival [fm2,-]  is a traditional Chinese festival to celebrate the coming new year.  It is in some way like the Christmas day [fm3,-]  in Europe.  For example, people also have new year's eve on which they eat a delicious meal.  Then the family get together happily waiting for the new year to come.  Like the turkey for Christmas, the Chinese dumpling is one of the traditional food for Spring-festival [fm2,-] .     The Spring-festival [fm2,-]  usually lasts for 20 days.  Besides celebration, people also make good plans for the new year.  It is said that "A good Spring-festival [fm2,-]  can bring you luck throughout the year."  Thus, [np7,-2]  spring festival  [fm2,-]  becomes the most important holiday for every Chinese.  

<ST 5> <SEX 2> <Y 8> <SCH Zhongda> <AGE 20> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1>       A Misunderstanding in Science and Language Study      The study of science and the study of language seem to be quite different.  When the students of language talk about the study of science, they feel [wd4,2-1]  headache.  Why does this happen?     To look into the problem, we have to go back to our high school.  It is the training method of our high school that brings this result.  When you decide to study [np7,5-1]  language, a subject  involved [wd3,2-2]  in arts, you devote most of your time to remembering things, Chinese, history, politics, etc.  You try to remember everything in the text book [fm2,-] . Gradually, you will lose the ability [np1,4-3]  of thinking logically which is very common in the study of science. You will slowly form a habit of learning things passively, and just recite what you've learnt.    After you enter the [np7,3-1]  college and become a major of language, you take it for granted that since language is involved [wd3,2-2]  in arts, the way of studying it should  be passive--rememberance [wd7,-] .  In fact, this is quite [np7, 3-1]  misunderstanding.    First of all, study is not a passive work.  No matter which subject you learn, your eagerness is the precondition of your study.     Secondly, logical thinking is also important in language study.  I believe some of you have [vp6,5-3]  such experience that sometimes you want to say something, but you just can't get [wd4,7-1]  across.  This is because you are lack of logical thinking.  On this occasion, you always try to put the words you are going to speak in [np7,1-2]  right order.  And  You [fm3,-]  do this just as the students of science use logical thinking to solve their science problems.   Thirdly and lastly, since you are not a native-speaker [sn9,-] you certainly have to remember something.  But just notice that the aim of your rememberance [wd3,4-6]  is to use the language for communication and the more you practise it, the more you are familiar with it.     From the above, we can see that the study [wd4,2-1]  language is really a hard task.  Not only have [vp9,2-3]  you [np7,2-2]  good memory, but also a logical mind.  The differences between the study of language and science is disappeared [vp7,10-] .  As an English major [np6,4-3] , we really have a long way to go. 

<ST 5> <SEX 2> <Y 8> <SCH Zhongda> <AGE 20> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 2>           The sketch of Galileo's character     Like all other great scientists, Galileo had both an observant mind and a great soul.    When he was in his childhood, he was curious  about the world and was forever experimenting and devising tests to probe the mystery of things.  The observant mind made him brash enough to challenge a theory of the great Aristotle .  Because of this, he had earned [cc3,-5]  himself the jealousy and hatred of his colleagues. He was unaware of all this persecution.  To him, scientific truth is [vp6,11-1]  everything.     The determination to pursue scientific truth as well as the patriotism for his hometown, Pisa, delivered him into the torture chamber of the Inquisition.  He fought against it, but it was a pity that he did not keep on.  Finally he was compelled to renounce his belief.  But if we take the hard situation into consideration, we shall [vp9,10-]  say Galileo is still a great person.  At his times [pp2,2-] , the Inquisition was too strong that [cj1,5-5]  no one could defied [vp4,3-1]  it.  It is said that after his renouncement, Galileo remarked under his breath that, "But the earth does move!"  This showed that his belief did not change.  The scientific truth was still in his heart.   From this, we can see that it is difficult to become a scientist.  It is even more difficult to become a true scientist.    And Gelileo [fm1,-]  is just one of them [pr1,16-] . 

<ST 5> <SEX 2> <Y 8> <SCH Zhongda> <AGE 20> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 2>    Mother's dream     I took out the application form during the meal.  "Mum," I said, "We are asked to fill in this form."   Mother took the form. "Well, which college are you determined to go [vp1,6-] ?" She asked.    "Mum, I don't want to go to college.  I'm..."  Her face turned cloudy [wd3,3-] .  It was the expected result.  I waited for her bursting out, but she just put down her chopsticks and went to the living-room without any words.    "You should not do that."  my father said to me as he patted my shoulder.    "Dad, I don't mean to defend [wd3,4-1]  mum [fm3,-] .  I just can't bare [fm1,-]  the competition of entering the [np7,8-1]  college.  I am tired."   "I know, my dear!  But do you know it is your mother's greatest hope that you can enter the [np7,3-1]  college?"   I opened my eyes wide when my father began my mother's story.     When my mother was young, she was the top student of her class.  Just after she had entered the key middle school, the Cultural Revolution began.  She had to quilt [fm1,-]  her study and went to work on the farm.  She was only 14, and was determined to go to college afterwards.  During the campaign, she caught ever [fm1,-]  chance to learn.  She was a person with strong perseverance.  At the end of the campaign, she became a worker and married my father.      After marriage, my mother thought of taking part in the entrance exams of college.  Just then, she was pregnant.  She faced a [np7,-12]  choice whether to give birth to me or to go on study.  She chose me because she was maternal [wd3,6-] .  Her dream, however, became foam [wd3,4-]  this time and it faded away completely.  As a wife and a mother, she had to take on such heavy and time-consuming housework that she had no time to think of her dream.  She devoted herself to her family.     "After your birth, your mother found her dream again.  It's you!  You are her new hope!  Just think of it, what you do will break her dream a third time!" [sn1,s] Father finished [wd4,2-1]  story and left me alone in the dining-room.    In front of me was the application form.  I never knew my mother's dream and how cruel life had treated her dream [wd5, 6-] .  I suddenly understood the saying "Every mother is a great person."                                                     I took out the [np7,3-1]  pen and filled in the form "Zhongshan University."  I knew thoroughly that it was me to fulfill my mother's dream! [sn8,s]

F. C. Co. Guangzhou Branch Guangzhou, GuangDong China Dear Sir,     I am wring to apply for the vacancy [wd3,7-3]  of the secretary offered by your company.    You will see from my C.V. I enclose with the letter that I graduated from a vocational school major [vp4,6-2]  in secretary.  In my previous position I was a secretary in Dulux Company.  This gave me some more experience in addition to what I had learnt in school.  Now I am able to operate [np7,2-1]  computer and type at a high speed without mistakes.  I am good at stenography and work [vp4,6-2]  with files.  I also know how to take the client in my stride and I'd like to give the manager a piece of my mind [wd3,8-]  if he/she wants it.     I am available for immediate employment and I look forward o hearing from you soon.                                                                 Yours truly,                                                                 Dora    

<ST 5> <SEX 2> <Y 8> <SCH Zhongda> <AGE 20> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1>             Final words of the defense lawyer    Your honour,     We have listened to all the witnesses and conducted thorough cross-examinations.  It's time we concluded that the boy is innocent, because there are a number of reasonable doubts in the evidence  the prosecutor gave.     Let's start with the switch knife.  The prosecutor said that the knife is [vp6,6-1]  unusual. The shop keeper identified it and said it was the only one of its kind he had.  Everyone connected with the case identified this knife.  But my assistant got a same [wd3,4-1]  knife in a little junk shop around the corner from the boy's house.  This shows that it is chance [wd3,2-1]  that others get a similar knife.     Then the downward angle of the wound in the dead body.  The boy is five feet eight inches tall.  His father was six  feet two inches.  It's very hard to stab down into the chest of someone who's taller than you.  And if we take the boy's background into consideration, he would not stab it that way.  He got used to knife fight and anyone who has ever used a switch knife would use it underhanded.     Secondly, let's look at the woman's  testimony.  She was lying in bed and couldn't sleep.  Right across the street she saw the boy stick the knife into his father.  That's all what [wd5,2-2]  she said but the woman is near sighted.  Surely she would not wear her glasses in bed.  How could she see clearly without her glasses. [sn9,-]   She saw only a blur.     Thirdly, there are several doubt [np6,3-]  about the times [np5,1-5]  in the old man's testimony.  It takes an elevated train 10 seconds to pass a given point.  That is 2 seconds per car.  According to the woman, that EL had been going by the old man's window for at least six seconds before the body fell.  And in such awful noise, the old man could not hear the boy say "I'm going to kill you."  That's one point.  Then in his testimony, he said when he heard a body falling, he ran to the door of his apartment and looked out and saw the kid beat it downstairs fifteen seconds after the killing.  We conducted an experiment in court that for an old man like him it would take him at least thirty-nine seconds to do all this.  So his testimony is unbelievable.    For the above mentioned reasons, we say that the boy is innocent.  And we appeal [vp1,1-2]  the jury to vote for innocent for the boy.[sn,s].

They have a lot of the same things.     First, people in different places all make a lot of preparation [np6,4-]  to celebrate them. In [wd4,1-3]  east [fm3,-]  and   [wd4,3-1] west [fm3,-] , the street light and store windows are decorated with the traditional colours of red and green before the festivals.     Secondly, On [fm3,-]  Christmas and the Spring Festival people in different places  all send cards to each other.     However, because the geography [wd3,2-17]  and the culture are different, there are a lot of differences between Christmas and the Spring Festival, too.     First  [sn9,-] they have different meanings. People celebrate Christmas to memorize [wd3,4-1]   Jesus, while people celebrate the Spring Festival to welcome a new year.     Secondly; [sn9,-]  on Christmas Eve in the west [fm3,-]  many families go to church and on the Spring Festival in the east [fm3,-]  many families stay at home to watch TV programme [wd5,3-] .     Thirdly, on Christmas people buy Christmas trees to symbolise [fm1,-]  eternal life while on the Spring Festival people are used to playing firecrackers [cc3,2-]  to express their happiness.    Fourthly, people eat different foods.  On Christmas people will enjoy a traditional Christmas dinner -- turkey or ham, sweet  potatoes, vegetables, mince pies and so on.  On [wd4,1-2] Spring Festival people like to eat fish and ravioli.     Last, on Christmas the children in the  west [fm3,-]  will hang stockings near the chimneys, hoping that Santa Claus will fill them with peasants [wd3,6-] .  On the  Spring Festival the children will visit relatives and get money from them.  They think that will bless [vp1,-4]  them safety and luck in the new year.

All of them can be divided into two branches -- language study and science study.    They are a lot of differences between them.    Language study is mainly depended [vp7,4-4]  on people's concrete thoughts.  Language is connected with morpheme, words, phrases, clauses and sentences.  You must remember words, use phrases and make up sentences.  Language has its rules called grammar, telling something about sentence structure and tenses.  If you write  something, you must obey the rules.    Further [wd3,-4] , writing is not enough.  To master a foreign language, listening and speaking is also very important. If you can't listen [wd3,3-7] , you'll not know what other people say and if you don't speak, other people can never know our ideas.  To learn listening and speaking well, you must practise a lot, knowing the cluster readings, acquainting [vp1, -4]  the pronunciations and intonations, and enlarging your vocabularies.    If you want your foreign language improved, you should learn some more things, such as idioms, foreign culture and so on.  Thus you can express yourself and translate better, and use words more properly.    As a student of language study [wd5,5-] , I have the experiences above. In one word, you must remember a lot to learn languages well.     On the contrary, science study is mainly depended [vp7,4-4]  on people's abstract thoughts.  It is connected with lines, numbers and shapes.  The essence of studying it is thinking and imaging. Whether people can learn it well depends on people's abstract [wd3,1-1]  abilities.  Science also has its own rules called theorems, but it is different from the grammars.  You must not only remember it but also use it freely.  With the the you will look out not a problem, but a sort of problems. [sn8,s]   You must imagine what will happen if you change the conditions or states and do a lot of experiments to examine your imaginations.[sn8,s]       Though language study and science study are so different, if you want to learn it [pr1,14-]  well, you must use your head and work hard.

However, he proved another important fact that two different weights drop [vp4,3-14]  simultaneously from the same height, [sn9,-]  would fall to the ground at the same time.  In order to prove the Falling Theory, he tasted a lot of bitter things, and all of these can show his character to us.     First, he was extraordinary [wd2,2-1]  observant and liked thinking   very much.  He observed every detail in the lives [wd3,6-] .  Some of the phenomena are so common that we all take them for granted, but Gelileo [fm1,-]  asked why and tried to find the answers.  Just because of this, he found out a lot of truth.  As we all know [sn9,-]  millions of people have seen apples fall to the ground, but only Newton found out the gravitation of the earth.     Secondly, he had a dedicating spirit of examining the nature and pursuing the scientific truth.  He could not accept the answers of the authority unless he himself did experiments to prove them.  For pursuing the truth, he even contradict [vp6, 2-1]  Aristotle.     Thirdly, also the most importantly, he was very brave and undeunted [fm1,-] .  He dared to have differently [wd2,2-1]  thoughts and proved theory that different from Aristotle. [sn8, s]   He even dared to do anything for seeking the truth.  Though the authority had warned him many times, never did he stop working.  He even published a book to disclose the results of his work to the world because he was undounted [fm1,-]  and could not suppress his ideas. Even if the students were scornful, even if the proffessors [fm1,-]  were very angry, and even if he knew what would happen if he proved his theory, he did it at last.    Galileo had devoted himself to the [wd5,3-1]  science.  He was so great a scientist that we will admire him for ever [fm2, -] .

This is the general idea from the past 20 years.[sn,s].   However, the things that impressed me most deeply are some living details.    I remember the time very clearly.  It was on October 1, 1988, when I was only a child of 10 years old.  The day before the National Day, I had finished all of my homework, because I hoped to go to [wd4,2-1]  zoo with my parents, just as the last few national Days.[sn,s]. On the morning of October 1, when I told my father the idea, to my surprise, he refused me.  He was preparing for passing a very important examination which can [vp6,10-3]  help his work a lot.    I was very disappointed and my mother comforted me again and again.  She told me that my father was very busy and the examination was very important for him, [wd4,s-]  she would take me to the zoo.  That year, I was ten years old and was so capricious and stubborn that I insisted on my father taking me there as usual.         I began to cry, begging them.  I didn't understand them at all.  Hearing my cry, my father had to give up.  He stood up from the chair, put on his cat [wd3,3-]  and took me to the zoo. That day, I was so happy that we didn't go home until the sun had fallen [wd3,3-3]  behind the mountain.  After dinner, I watched TV for a moment, [wd4,6-4]  then went to bed.  I fell asleep with a smile quickly. Waked [fm2,-]  up by a nightmare in [pp1,-2]  the mid-night, I saw the light in my  parents' room was still lighting [wd3,10-] .  I walked there with [pp1,-2]  my tiptoe ,to my surprise, my father was still sitting beside the desk to study [vp5,8-] , concentrating all of his attention.  It was 12 o'clock already.  My mother didn't sleep either, lying on the bed and reading some newspaper. After a moment, I heard their [pr4,2-1]  talking:   "You should not take her to the zoo.  If you studyed [fm2,-]  n the daytime, you can go to sleep now."  my mother said.    "No, I can refuse her words, but I can not refuse her tears.  I can not bear [cc3,3-2]  her disappointment. "  said my father,.    "You spoil [vp6,1-3]  her so much."    "So do you! We all love her, don't we?"    Hearing these words, my tears fell down along my cheek [np6,6-]  without controlling.[sn,s]   My heart can not be quiet for a long time.     "I love you, too"  I said to my parents in my heart.

I would like to apply for the position.    I was graduated [vp7,2-]  from Zhongshan University and was an English major, so I know English very well.  Being good at Chinese, I can translate English not only quickly and correctly, but  also with literary grace.  Having the experience of translating for over 2 years, I have enough confidence and enthusiasm to do the job very well.     If you are interested in my  application, I am very glad to come for an interview.    Thank you for your consideration.                                                                  sincerely [fm3,-]  yours,                                                                  Li Man  

<ST 5><SEX 2><Y 8><SCH Zhongda><AGE 19><WAY 3><DIC 1><TYP 1>                                                                    After hearing the old man and the woman's words you will think that the boy may be guilty.[sn,s].   But let us see the acts from surface to essence and think more deeply,   I think all of you will agree with me that the boy is innocent.    First, the boy is only 19 years old.  Because of some bad deeds, we may have a bad impression on [pp1,6-1]  him.  But let us see the truth that he lives in a slum and has been kicked around all his life.  His mother died since he was nine and his father beat him up regularly.  What can we require [wd3,3-8]  for [pp1,4-3] such a boy in a broken home?  I think we should show more our [wd5,2-1]  mercy, not prejudice.     Secondly, let us think about the old man's testimony.  according [pp2,-2]  his words, at 10 minutes after 12, he heard he loud  noice [fm1,-]  in [wd5,3-1]  upstairs.  Then he heard the kid say to his father "I am going to kill you."  A second later, he heard a body falling. Running to the door of his apartment, he saw the kid running down the stairs and out of the house.  But  let us use our heads and think [vp1,-2]  it further. He says he got up from the bed in his room and went down the hall to the front door.  He opened it and looked out in time to see the boy racing down the stairs.  According  to the research, e know that his bed was by the window, which is 12 feet to [pp1,10-3]  the bedroom door.  The hall is 43 feet, 6 inches long.  He had to get out of bed, get his canes, walk 12 feet, open the bedroom door, walk 43 feet, and open the front door -- all in 15 seconds.  Do you think this was possible? According to the experiment, we can quickly answer  "of course not."  Furthermore; [sn9,-] he had to be helped to sit into the witness chair.  Maybe some people think that the old man is too old to remember things well. Thus how can we believe an old man's words who can not be positive with things? [sn8,s]    Thirdly, the woman's testimony is also doubtful.  She sees the kid stick [wd3,2-2]  his father right across the street, across  The [fm3,-]  EL track at 11 o'clock that night.  As we all know that the first thing we do when we wake up at night and want to know the time is wearing glasses. [sn2,s-]   Because nobody wears glasses to bed and the woman had no time to put them on, I say she saw only a blur.    Fouthy [fm1,-] , there are a lot of the same things in the world.   I have show [vp6,1-2]  a knife which is the same as the boy's.  So it has great possibility that someone else killed his father with a same knife as the boy's.[sn8,s].       Last, the boy is 5 feet 8 inches tall.  His father was six two.  It's very hard to stab down into the chest of someone who's taller than you are.  Furthermore, anyone who's ever used a switch knife would never have stabbed downward.  Then the boy wouldn't have made the kind of wound that killed his father.     In conclution [fm1,-] , from the reasons above, I think and believe the boy is innocent.

In these time [wd3,9-]  all people feel very happy and give up plenty of vexeds [fm1,-] [wd3,4-]   which are in working and living. [sn8,s]   But there are a lot of differences.     Christmas is a public holiday in the western countries comemonates [fm1,-]  a saviour's birth which called birth. [sn8,s]   At that time, there are full of fun in everywhere. [sn8,s]   In the street, lights and stores [np6,2-4]   windows are decorated with the traditional christmas [fm3,-]  colours of red and green.  People go shopping and decorate [wd4,4-4]  home [wd3,1-3]  inside and outside, trim trees with coloured lighted d3,4-] .  [sn8,s]  In many communities there is the costom [fm1,-]  of decorating a big Christmas  tree for out-door display.  On christmas eve or morning many families go to church.    After this they come home to enjoy a traditional christmas fm3,-]  dinner.  After this most people exchange presents and send christmas [fm3,-]  cards to their friends, relatives and business associate [np6,9-] .  In a word it is the most pleasant time of [wd4,5-1]  year.    However [sn9,-]  in China [sn9,-]  Spring Festival is also the biggest holidays [np6,6-] . It celebrates an influent [wd3,1-1]  harvest in a year, express [vp3,8-] [wd3,8-3]   a new beginning.  People will emphasis [wd2,2-] . So on New year's eve, each families [np6,1-4]  has a great  abound [wd3,2-1]  dinner, fall the peak of the celebration of a [wd5,-1]  activities.[sn,s].  On New Year's Day, people will dress [vp1,2-3]  in their finest. And on the fifth day of the lunar calendar, people will make jiao zi because it will bring good luck in the new year.  At the end of the night is Yuan Xiao, [sn8,s] also known as the Lanterm [fm1,-]  Festival. [wd4,-6] Chinese custom calls for the display of lanterm [fm1,-]  inside or outside of the house because it will bring luck.  According to Taoist belief, the lord of heaven visited the earth on the lanterm [fm1,-]  .  Festival to confer luck and happiness on those who are morally upright. [sn2,s-]     Although they are different festivals, people are very happy at that [pr1,10-1]  time.

[sn8,s]      In people's lives, they want plenty of matters to take place and some not so do I.[sn,s].   But I expect to do some strongly, [sn8,s]  can you guess?     In fact, the scale is unsteadable [fm1,-]  in the  world. [sn8,s]It is very dangerous unless a new scale is establishment [wd2,5-]. So I expect to [wd5,-]peace all over the world because I know fighting to all over the world causes a lot of suffering-people are homeless, no food to eat, unwearing [fm1,-] and no water to drink, even full of illness.[sn8,s]. I always watch those on TV.  For example, in Israel people become thin and die because of fighting.  I was [vp6,11-]  sympathy [wd2,2-3]  of those people, but I can't help them.  A few years ago, I remembered a person who predicted that a new world war would be happened, [vp7,6-]  which made me vexed because  I didn't expect to bear these suffering [np6,1-] .[sn,s].  Now that is not true and I feel very happy.    I unexpect [fm2,-]  that there is [vp3,1-2]  no disasters everywhere.[sn,s].   The warmer it become [vp3,3-] , the worse our envionment [fm1,-]  is getting.  During a few years, some large disasters took place, especially in China, most of cities which are very poor take place flood.[sn,s].   I impressed on TV, which an old person stood in his field covering [vp5,2-1]  water, dampfounded [fm1,-]  forwards, his labour  was destoried [fm2,-] .  [sn8,s] According to scientists' saying [wd3,3-] , the main reason is [wd4,4-3]  [wd3,-3]  temperature become [vp3,1-1]     warm and make [vp3,4-1]  water turning to vapour, going through a long distance and it will fall.[sn,s]. Besides this, many disasters was [vp3,2-1] [vp6,2-5]   made [wd3,3-4]  by the bad enviornment [fm1,-] . I hope people love where we live.  And then we can live happily.     Those is [vp3,1-2]  my expectations, what about you? [sn8,s]

Both science and language are knowledge.  As a college student try his best to master knowledge, [sn2,s-]  but they are different areas, he can not grasp them well.[sn,s].   However, everybody chooses his favour [wd2,1-1]  subject to learn, if you choose the subject which you don't enjoy, you won't study it well and will give yourself much pressure.  This is an important problem to choose.[sn,s].     Second, whatever we learn, we must try our best to do with it. [sn8,s]  And we must spend much time to work hard.  Learning science always spend plenty of time in  calculation and realizing theories.[sn,s].  Sometimes they [pr1,s-]  see rare phenomenon, find [wd3,5-7]  theories they [pr1,s-]  have learn [vp4,4-3]  to explain it.  But they [pr1,s-]  also think learning [wd4,1-1]  language students are free.  In fact, they are wrong.  Learning [wd4,1-1]  language student [np6,s-]  also spend all the time in remembering and doing exercise.  The subject is not easy to master, which contain [vp3,8-]  grammar [sn9,-]  listening, reading and writing. Specially [wd3,-s]  listening and reading, you must have a large words [wd3,5-] .  So it is hard to learn it. In my view, I both enjoy two subjects.  [sn9,-] No matter where their difference, they are relation in the knowledge.[sn,s].   Language helps scientist [np6,s-]  to realize [wd3,4-4]  the knowledge of abroad; Science is helped to communicate language.[sn,s].  So they are the same system of knowledge.[sn8,s]

He discoveried [fm1,-]  movement of the heavy bodies and gravity, etc.  But as a proverb is successful man's back is hard life that is true.[sn,s].  In his ages, under the Rome [wd3, -1]  Catholic controlled, he didn't allow [vp7,2-4]  to affect their rule.  [sn8,s]   For his characters[pp1,2-], he overcome [vp6,1-2]  all difficulties .     First, he was a [wd5,2-7]  extraordinarily observant and his curiosity about everything.[sn,s].   At the age of 19, entering the university, he made his first discovery.  One day he went to church and occasionally looked up the handing oil lamp to swing.[sn,s].  Looking conciously [fm1,-] [wd3,1-2]  , he discoveried [fm1,-] [vp1,-4]   the lamp to swing rhythmically, and he found a principle of movement, which was applied to measure time and movement of heavies [fm1,-] [wd3,6-]      Second, his willpower made him finish his research.  In [pp2,-2]  that time, many professor [np6,1-]  obeied [fm2,-]  Aristotle's theory [cc3,3-]  which was idealist.[sn,s].   But Galileo was materlism [fm1,-]  [wd3,2-]  that he considered Aristotle's opinion  so that most of professor [np6,2-]  objected him.[sn,s].   However, he disguised [wd3,1-3]  to be deaf, [wd4,5-3] finished his work.    An important   character was followed up the truth.[sn,s].  Under the persecuations [np6,2-2]  of [wd4,4-1]  Inquisition, he had still believed [vp6,3-1]  Copernicus' theory was true, which was heresy.  Because of that, returning to Pisa, he was sent to the holy office and died on January 8 ,1642.    In a conclusion [wd3,-] , Galileo sent [vp2,-3]  as an example, we must persisted [vp4,2-3]  to [pp1,3-2]  the truth.

Sometimes he would order me again and again.  And I thought he was always long-winded.  It was that until one day -- October 4, I changed mind.[sn,s].      That day was the last  day of my holiday, [sn9,-]  I must go to the [wd5,4-5]  school and do my homework. As I hurried to put [wd4,2-7]  clothes, books and food in my bag, my father looked at me.  Making me trouble, he always said, "put everything in your bag and be look out to take a bus.[sn,s].   Every time I went to Guangzhou, following him to the bus stop. sn2,s-]   But today my baddage [fm1,-]  was too heavy, and my 6-year-old brother at home.[sn,s].  I made a determind [fm1,-] to go there with my mother by bike and asked my father not to go, feeling my ears.[sn,s]. To my unexpectedly [pp2,2-]  he agreed to that idea.  When I got ready to go away, he went out with my mother.  I felt that very interesting and happy, talked with my mother to bus stop.[sn,s].

[sn8,s] " "Yes, I am always nervours [fm1,-]  thinking u how to take a bus and how to take these baddage [fm1,-] .

[sn8,s]  You ill hurry [vp6,5-]  and catch [vp6,7-]  a bus early. "  Then I woke up and saw him catch a bus, hurried [wd3,-3]  me to come.  At that time I went on the bus with wet eyes.     On the bus, seeing [wd3,-4]  out of the window, I thought and understood my father loved me very much.

But the system of law is something different, especially lawers [fm1,-]  and a jury. [sn8,s]    A [np7,s-2]  jury decide to convict someone guilty.  There are two kinds of lawyers, one for the accused, the other for the prosecutor.     At first, [wd4,-2]  defense lawer [fm1,-]  must know the hole case, and the  prosecutor [wd3,-6]  must say [wd3,-4]  the rue  [wd3,2-2]  to him.  After that he searches [vp1,-2]  much material about the case.  If the prosecutor [wd3,2-2]  was guilty, it is important that he must think [vp1,2-2]  other things to prove that all are wrong. Sometimes he must make a story to tell.  All things are ready, then in the court, he will listen to what  [wd4,1-2] witness [np6,5-7]  say and analyse their words to resort [wd3,s-] . [sn1,s] When he asked [vp6,2-12]  them, he will make him be wrong or out standing their shortcoming so that all jurors and [wd4,-1]judge can't believe them.[sn,s].   But that is not enough,he will make [vp1,-3]  [wd4,3-1]  witness to lie by many ways and destroy all evidences which are very important for the prosecutor. [sn1,s]  In fact, it is important that he can prevent the opponent lawyer from asking questions and hypothesis [cc3,3-]  by using his thought [cc3,3-]  and eloquence .  But if he is innocence [wd2,3-] , he must search [vp1,-4]  all testimonies and witness. With those, he can tell his thought to judge and jurors.  In the end he will make a conclusion about the accused. If he don't [vp3,2-]  feel it win, he will try his best to decrease his punish.[sn,s].      In[pp2,-2] a way, [wd4,-2] defense law is very important for the accused to give up his guilty.[sn,s].

English  is our specialisation. Therefore, what we learn is mainly of English. For example, Intensive Reading, CECL, Oral Course, Hearing [wd3,5-4]  lesson and the like. [sn2,s-]   These offered [wd5,1-1]  courses can help us to make up eak [fm1,-] points and improve our abilities.  Especially in Oral and aring [wd7,7-] . [sn2,s-]     When we had the Hearing [wd3,4-1]  Lesson for the first time, I could hardly followed [vp4,3-2]  the records that the teacher gave [cc3,5-1]  us.  While [wd3,-5]  she asked us the [wd5,4-1]  questions, other students were able to answer them fluently.  I felt so nervous then that sweats [np5,-4]  dropped from my forehead.    Compared with others's hearing [wd3,3-6],  I realized, had a large gap.[sn,s].  My oral course was no difference with hearing.[sn,s].     I found that they were my weak objects [wd3,7-] .  What's more, the amount of my glossary [wd3,4-3]  are [vp3,5-]  too limited. How to improve them is my biggest goal at present.  I know clearly that only worrying about them is no use.   If I want to lessen the gap [cc3,3-],  I should spend much time and pay more vigour [cc3,3-]  than others.      In university, We are not only for enjoyment.[sn8,s]

The  Spring Festival is the biggest festival in China.  It's the time to celebrate the end of the year, the reuniting [wd3,-4]  of families and friends, and the looking forward to a brand new year. [sn8,s]   However, they also have different aspects in celebration.    Firstly, the time is different.  Christmas day is being celebrated [vp6,4-3]  on December 25th, while the Spring Festival is being celebrated [vp6,5-]  on December, [sn9,-]  31st of [wd4,2-2]  lunar calendar.     Secondly, the activities of celebration are various.  In the United States  people have a big dinner on the eve of Christmas Day.  The food includes golden butter cookee [fm1,-] , coffee  squares, gingerbread, chocolate fudge, candy and so forth.  The [wd5,-s]  parents put their gifts on their children's stockings, decorate the Christmas tree  with candles and presents; [wd4, 8-7]  send cards to their relatives and friends.  All these activities color the air of celebration.     In China we also have a big dinner on the eve of Spring Festival.  Especially in the [wd5,1-2]  North China, people eat special food: Jiaozi and noodle.  Besides, parents will give children the [wd5,4-2]  Lucky money, which implies blessings and hopes.  During this festival, people will visit and send gifts to their friends and relatives.  Children fire the crackers and fireworks, which makes them very excited.     Finally, the decorations are also different.  In the United States the poinsettia plant, evergreens and the holly are most common decorations.  The gay poinsettia row is most highly cherished.  Its rich red and green make this plant most appropriate for Christmas.  The evergreens are used to decorate the house, which bring in blessings and good luck.  The holly berries are used to dot the green branches.     In China we put the gatepost couplet and the door god on the door.  The former expresses the [wd5,3-3]  hope and blessing, the latter is regarded as the talisman, who protect [vp3,8-]  the family against danger. This tradition has lasted for more than a thousand years.      In a word, these two festivals have similarities and differences and we do hope [wd3,-2]their comings.

Science is the understanding of the natural world, while language is concerning [vp5,2-4]  about the social issues.  Naturally, there must be resemblances and differences in studying them.     I think the attitude is the assemblance [wd3,4-3]  in sudying [fm1,-] them.     Knowledge is power.  No matter what the knowledge is, we should learn it by [wd3,4-6]  courage, enthusiasm, confidence, curiosity and perseverance.  Without enthusiasm and curiosity, everything is boring to us, we shall lose our interests in learning it. [sn1,s] While we are carrying out a study course, we should have courage to look difficulty in the face; [sn9,-]  have confidence and perseverance to get over it.  Owing to these important elements, we'll study in an [np7,-4]  positive and active state.     As to differences, the learning skills are different most. [sn8,s]      Science is an accurate subject.  Therefore, we are patient and objective, and apply persistent and logic thought to the observation we makes [vp3,1-] .  We have to do the experiments in the laboratory, calculating and analysing, and make hypotheses of how [wd4,1-2]  process works and how events take place.     Studying language isn't seem as same as learning science. [sn8,s]   In order to master it well, we should pay attention to four elements: writing, reading, listening and speaking.  Neither [pr1,10-5]  of them should be neglected.  On writing and reading, we master the knowledge [cc3,3-]  on books; on listening and speaking, we utilize language in our daily life. [sn8,s]   Remembering a large amount of grammers [fm1,-]  [np6,5-4]  and vocabulary isn't enough.  Language is agile [wd3,2-]  and perceptual, so we use it in different ways.     In summary, we should put our hearts into studying and master [vp5,8-4]  knowledge [cc3,2-]  in different ways.

He founded the modern mechanics and experiment [wd2,3-1]  physics.  Though he suffered many persecutions, he still achieved quite a few achievements.  What makes [wd3,1-3]  him to success ?  If you have learned something about him, you'll get an explicit answer.     To begin with, he is full of curiosity.  He wants to find out how and why the world is.  He usually directs his attention towards problem [np6,4-7]  which he notices have no satisfactory explanation, and his curiosity makes him look for the accurate answer.  Because of his observance, he found the isochronism [fm1,-] of pendiculum [fm1,-].  To a scientist, it is the basic element.     Secondly, he is skeptical [fm1,-].  He doesn't accept the statements which aren't based on the most complete evidence available, and makes experiments carefully and objectively to verify them.  He isn't take the authority for granted.[sn,s].   As we all know, Galileo restated the heliocebtric [fm1,-] theory after Copernicus.  During that times [np5,2-] , it was thought as heresay [fm1,-]. Nevertheless, his theory has been proved to be true to this day.     Thirdly, he is persistent.  He was sure that his viewpoint was true [wd3,3-] .  Although the professor threatened him; [sn9,-]  the students sneered at him; [sn9,-]  even the cardinal persecuted him, he didn't take these into consideration.  In fact, he would not bow to the religious power.     As a scientist, he achieved many achievements; as a man, he had the excellent characters.  His name -- Galileo like a star shining in the sky. [sn2,s-]   We will remember him forever.

Its distribution is approximately like this:  the students' dormitories lies [vp3,3-]  in the eastern part; the buildings of all departments set up in the central part; the residential districts lies [vp3,3-]  in the western part.  Its total area is about one square kilometers.     Our campus is full of subtropical features.  It goes without saying it is a green campus.  When you are in it, you'll feel be steeped in a green sea with satisfaction.  [sn8,s]  It has so many subtropical and tropical trees and the evergreen trees, such as the palm tree, banyan, lilac, Cercis chinensis and many other trees anonymous [wd3,3-] .  Whatever the path or rode [fm1,-] , they are all lined with trees.[sn,s].   When the wind rustle [vp3,3-2]  the leaves, especially in summer, you will be immersed in [wd4,1-2]  refreshing atmosphere.   Like our foreign language department, many beautiful flowers blossom one after another.[sn,s].   When wind blows them, the purple petals fall like a [wd5,-3]  purple flower raindrops.  Besides, the small wild flower wear [vp3,4-]  a lovely face [cc3,4-]  to welcome every passer by beside the road.     Our campus has many old-fashioned architectures [wd3,1-] .  Because this university was built in [wd4,1-1]  1920's, it owned quite a lot of old-fashioned buildings.  Whatever the residential areas, the teaching buildings, or the auditoriums, more or less keeps the style of that times.[sn,s].   During the weekends, many visitors come to our campus to take photos, and naturally such buildings are the best settings for them.  This kind of buildings become a special scenery in the campus.    Our campus has a wild [wd3,4-1]  lawn in the central part.  On [pp2,-3]  the center of the lawn stands the statue of Sun Yat-sen.  He stands still, watches every passers-by [np6,1-] , whatever which seasons, rainy or sunny.[sn,s].   This monument was built up [wd3,4-]  for remembering the founder of our university [fm1,-] -- Sun Yat-sen.  Besides, this lawn is an enjoyable place to us.  As we see this green grass carpet, our eyes are relaxed, and forget all the tiredness.[sn,s].   In the Spring [fm3,-] , it is the most beautiful place.  Looking at the light lovely green [wd1,3-1]  grass, you'll hope you can lay [wd3,-2]  on [wd4,2-1]  grass and enjoy the warm sunlight.     Our campus does a peaceful place.[sn,s].   I hope that our school will make further progress so as to become a top university in our country.

I'm a college graduate.  At first, I was employed at a wholesaling [wd3,1-1]  company as a salesman for two years. Then I spent three years to receive a [np7,-2]  MBA diploma.  Afterwards, I worked as a manager in [wd4,4-6]  Import & Export co. [fm3,-] for three years.  I believe my education and experiences [np6, 3-5]  qualify me for a position in your company as a manager.     I've enclosed a copy of curriculum vitae, MBA diploma and transcripts for your information.     I'm [vp6,1-12]  glad to call at your office if you desire a personal interview. Respectfully yours, H.B. John.  

<ST 5><SEX 2><Y 8><SCH Zhongda><AGE 21><WAY 3><DIC 1><TYP 1>                                                                  Ladies and gentlemen, attention please!  Each person is innocent until [wd4,5-3]  is proven guilty.  No, we should not say this boy is a criminal until he is proven guilty.     Now let's settle the reasonable doubts in this case.     Above all, let's talk about the old man's witness [wd3,6-] . His apartment is right under the apartment where the killing took place.  His bed is by the window.  It's twelve feet from his bed to the bedroom door.  The hall is forty-three feet, six inches long.     Suppose when he heard the body falling he got out of bed, got his canes, walk [vp6,8-]  twelve feet, open [vp6,10-]  the bedroom door, walk [vp6,13-]  forty-three feet, and open [vp6, 16-]  the front door, saw the boy running downstairs.  How long did he [pr1,s-s]  take?  He said fifteen seconds.  However, he is so old that he only walks very slowly and even helped [vp7, 7-2]  by others into the witness chair.  So, his remark [np6, 1-2]  is doubtful.  I had demonstrated [vp6,2-6]  once, which took me thirty-nine seconds.     Secondly, that knife is also an important witness [wd3,s-] . His father was stabbed with this knife.  I had searched [vp6,2-5]  that area and found that quite a few second-hand shops sold it out [wd5,s-] .  We can't say it was the boy who committed the murder.  Someone else who helds [fm2,-]  it may did [vp4,6-1]  it.    Besides, this boy is five feet eight inches tall.  His father was six two.  It's hard to stab down the chest of someone who's taller than you are.  It's also a considerable [wd3,3-1]  point.     Thirdly, let's look at that woman's witness [wd3,s-] .  At [wd5,-2]  that night, she went to bed about eleven o'clock.  Her bed was next to the open window, and she could see right into the window across the elevated trains.  After tossing and turning for an hour, she turned toward the window at about twelve ten.  Then she saw the killing through the window of a moving train.     Now, I want to mention something about the EL train.  It has five cars.  When it passes a given point, it lasts ten seconds, or two seconds a car.  So, the train had been going by the old woman's window for at least six seconds before the body fell, according to that woman.  That old man said he had heard [vp1,2-3]  the boy shouted "I'm going to kill you."  while the train was roaring past his nose.  It was so noisy that everybody could not hear it. Maybe the old man was lying or he thought he had heard it.     Furthermore, let's look at that woman.  She saw the murder through the window of [wd4,3-3]  last two cars.  I put in a word, do you notice that she wore glasses when she was at [wd3,3-1]  court?  So when she slept, she didn't wear glasses as she said.  Suppose she put the glasses near the bed, the murder was taking place as she looked out.  The light went out a second later, she couldn't had [vp4,2-6]  time to put on her glasses.  Maybe what she saw was only a blur.     Now, as you can see, these two eyewitnesses' remarks have so many considerable doubts.  What they spoke [wd3,2-3]  was not fit[wd3,-] for the murder on the spot.   So according to the facts I mentioned, I think this boy is innocent.

After reading it, what impresses upon my mind most, is the leading role, Jane Eyre's resistance[cc1,-1] spirit. This characteristic runs through all Jane's life. We can see it by her words, her thoughts and her actions.        In this novel, Jane's experiences can be divided into four parts: at Gateshead, at Lowood Orphanage, at Thornfield and at the River's .  Jane's character is embodied in these experiences gradually.         Jane lost both her parents at an early age.  She was brought up at Gateshead, her aunt's house, where she was looked down upon and ill-treated by her aunt and cousins.  In such a condition Jane's resistance [cc1,-]spirit showed [wd3,-]little by little. Here we can see two high ideas [cc4,2-] .  One is when she was beaten by her cousin John, she called  out to him, "Wicked and cruel boy!" "You're like a murderer -- you are like a slave-driver -- you're like the evil rulers of ancient Rome! " For a child relying on her relation [wd3,3-2]  for life, it takes much strength and courage to say those words.  The other high tide [wd3,4-]  is: The night before Jane left Gateshead for Lowood, she gathered all her energies and spoke out those words to her cruel aunt, "I dislike you the worst of anyone in the world, except John Reed." "If anyone asks me how I like you, and how you treated me.  I will say that...you treated me with miserable cruelty."  Such words from a ten-year-old little girl! Even the cruel woman "look [vp6,3-1]  frightened"        In Lowood Orphanage, the life conditions were very hard.  Jane and her companions received forments [fm1,-]  not only in body, but in mind .  She once said to Helen Burns, a friend of hers. [sn9,-]   "When we are struck without a reason, we should strike back very hard."  Striking back very hard!  Not willing to be oppressed!  That's Jane Eyre.        After 8 years' life in Lowood Orphanage, a wild desire for freedom came over Jane.  She hoped for a new condition.  She was willing to be accepted as a governess at Thornfield .  There she met the master of Thornfield, Mr Rochester.  They understood each other and were attracted [wd4,2-2]  each other.  They intended to marry [vp7,s-] .  But things were going on difficultly.  Here Jane Eyre's resistance [wd2,-1]  spirit showed fully.  For example, when Jane learned that Mr Rochester had intended to marry Miss Ingram but still wanted her to stay at Thornfield, Jane called out, stirred to something like passion.  "Do you think I am a machine without feelings?... I'm not talking to you now by the standards of custom and the world. It's my spirit that addresses your spirit, as if we stood before God, equal, as we are!"  It's because Jane put emphasis on "equal" that she left Thornfield when she learned at the wedding that Mr Rochester had married fifteen years ago and his mad wife was still alive .  Jane felt she was cheated.  She must defend dignity of her own!     It was a hard time for her after she left Thornfield.  She ad no money.  She had no job.  She nearly died...But she wouldn't be regarded as a beggar.  Then she was accepted by the River's Family.  There her fate changed.  Her uncle left her all his property.  She learned that the Rivers were her relations.  But Jane still, or even strongly thought of Mr Rochester. [sn8,s] She refused to marry his [pr1,4-1]  cousin, for she didn't love him.  Because of the strength of love, Jane returned to Thornfield, to find it had become a blackened ruin.  And Mr. Rochester had lost his see-sight [wd3,5-]  in a fire.  But Jane married him and they led a happy life.    Such is Jane Eyre, a woman who has resistance [wd2,-1]  spirit, a woman that has strong desire for freedom and happiness!

A famous American literary critic thought that Jane Austen, the author of Pride and Prejudice, could even be compared with Shakespere.  After reading the novel myself, I find that it is really worthy of the name -- one of the world's ten masterpieces.    Someone thought Jane was both a moralist and a humorist.  These, I think, are embodied in Pride and Prejudice fully.     To [pp2,-3] the author's opinion, such marriage as is based on money and beauty is unhappy.  Like Charlotte and Collins, Charlotte married Collins only because she was old enough to marry, only because she had to find an "insurance box " for her food, clothing and shelter.  Now let's see Lydia and Wickham. Lydia loved Wickham because he was a handsome man, wearing military uniform.  What did they get after their marriage? "His (Wickham's) affection for her soon sunk into indifference: hers (Lydia's) lasted a little longer....she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her."     On the contrary, Jane's and Elizabeth's marriages are based on love.  Whether Elizabeth and Darcy or Jane and Bingley, they paid more attention to the other's quality than other sides.  So they were happy all the time.     From the comparison, we can naturally draw a conclusion: Whether it is a happy marriage or not depends on whether they love each other and whether they are perfectly suited to each other.     After reading the novel, I can't help saying that it's a perfect satire.  It often made me into an awkard [fm1,-]  position.            Mrs Bannet was a very funny character.  The only thing that worried her was how to marry her daughters to a rich man [np6,s-] .  She believed that "a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of  a wife."  Whenever she met a wealthy young man, the most important thing for her was to find out if he had got married or not.  Let's see her funny reaction when she heard that Mr Bingley was still single.  "Oh! single, my dear, to be sure!  A man of large fortune...What a fine thing for our girls. "  As if she was sure that Mr Bingley would be her son-in-law. [sn2,s-]   Because such thoughts were filled with [pp1,1-2]her heart, she was angry, annoyed, sad when she learned that Mr Bingley had left without asking Jane to marry him; she was excited, exalted after she had married three of her daughters.     Now let's have a look at that proud Mrs. Catherine. In order to prevent Darcy and Elizabeth's marriage, she became rather active.  She first went a long way to threaten Elizabeth, then went to scold Darcy.  What was the result?  It actually helped Elizabeth and Darcy clear up the misunderstanding.  How funny and interesting!  I couldn't help applauding when I was reading this part.     In a word.  I like the novel very much, not because what other people say, not because of its fame, but because I really enjoy reading it.

He made his mark on two novels.  One is Monte Cristo, and the other is The Three Musketeers.     The success of the Three Musketeers lies in many sides [wd3,s-] , but I think the most important one is that it models [wd3,-3]  many characteristic figures.  For example, D'Artagnan and the three musketeers, Athos, Porthas and Aramis.    D'Artagnan, a young Gascon, was a determined, brave and intelligent man.  I draw the conclusion from the following three events.  The first is that D'Artagnan and his three friends vercame [fm1,-] many difficulties, broke through the dense nets made by Ricbelieu (The Cardinal) and got back the diamond which was a gift to the Duke of Buckingham by the French queen.  And this led to the failure of Ricbelieu's evil plan and protected the king and queen from being attacked by Ricbelieu.  The second is how D'Artagnan fought against Milady, the Cardinal's secret agents.  And the third is connected with the attack  against the port of Rochelle.     Actually, D'Artagnan is an adventurer, "without regret for the past, confident in the present, full of hope for the future. "  Even his opponent thought highly of him.  The Cardinal, for example, thought "his (D'Artagnan's) activity, his courage, and his understanding" were important to a good master.  And at last, the Cardinal made a wise decision, appointing D'Artagnan the officer of the Musketeers.     D'Artagnan gradually proved himself to be a perfect musketeer, which was his greatest wish.  What's more, during the course of fighting, D'Artagnan won the friendship of Athos, orthos and Aramis, the three Musketeers.       Athas, a man of his word. [sn2,s-]   He was very frank to friends.   He was calm and methodical.  We can see his intelligence from these two examples.  When the other three were just going to drink the anjou wine, which was actually sent by Milady with a forged letter, Athos said, "Do not let us foolishly drink wine from an unknown giver."  The facts proved him right.  The wine was poisoned [wd3,s-] .  One more example, he forced Milady to give him the paper the Cardinal signed, which read, "It is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has done."  it protected D'Artagnan from being put into prison after their execution of Milady.  In a word, Athos was a man of wisdom.     Porthos, though a little vain-glorious and boast [wd2,s-] , was a brave soldier.  He had a lot of shortcomings and was not as bright as his friends, but he fought with his friends side by side and never gave up.     Aramis, who was called the scholar and future monk by his friends, was also a determined man.  Many times he played an important role.    There are still many other characteristic figures in this novel.  For example, Milady and the Cardinal.  The three Musketeers is a lifelike picture of France from about 1625 to 1628.  

<ST 5><SEX 2><Y 8><SCH Zhongda><AGE 19><WAY 1><DIC 1><TYP 1>                                                                                             WHAT I THINK OF REBECCA    After reading VANITY FAIR, Rebecca impressed [cc3,-3]upon my mind most.      I must say that Rebecca was a woman of selfishness and cruelty.  She became ruthless in her methods for the purpose of getting into the upper society.  She even hurt Amelia, a gentle, tender-hearted woman, the only one who was really kind and friendly to her.     She envied Amelia because in her opinion, everything seemed to smile on  Amelia's fortunes.  "Her fortune comfortable settled, I have only myself and my brains to trust to [vp1,s-].  Well, let us see if some day or other I cannot show my real superiority.... only it will be a fine day when I can take my place above her in the world."  Bearing such feelings in her heart, she began to make plans for the future.     At Amelia's home, Rebecca met Amelia's brother,  Joseph.  He was rich and unmarried.  Having learned this, Rebecca was determined to conquer him.  She pretended to be very much interested in India because Joseph was in the East India Company's Civil Service.  She swallowed her feelings when she was played joke on by Joseph's father.  She just looked forward to Joseph's proposal, but it didn't come.  And Rebecca had to leave and take up her post in [wd4,1-2]  Crawley family.      There she determined to strengthen her position with the Crawley family by making friends of [vp2,3-1]  everyone who could at all interfere with her comfort.  In order to win the heart of Miss Crawley, a rich old lady, she did every kind of service.  Once Miss Crawley fell ill, Rebecca "spent as weary a fortnight as ever human beings could, in the old lady's ickroom [fm1,-], but her little body seemed made of iron."     During the time in [wd4,1-2]  Crawley family, Rebecca conquered Captain Rawdon Crawley and after their secret marriage, they ran away.  Rebecca made use of Miss Crawley's name as an introduction to society.  Maybe she thought herself successful.  In a famous ball given in Brussels,  Amelia and Rebecca were both present .  "While Amelia's appearance was a complete failure.  Mrs Rawdon Crawley's entrance was on the contrary, dazzling. ...Everyone looked at her.  Numbers of the men ...crowded round her, begging for the honour of a dance."  She greeted Amelia and began to talk in a superior way.  "She criticized both her dress, and her hair."  This happened after Amelia's father became a ruined man, and at that time Amelia had been married for about a week.  It was in this ball that Amelia's husband was struck by Rebecca, which was too much for Amelia to bear.     Rebecca's "success" didn't last  long.  Her husband could not bear her and left her.  And she also lost the love of her on, younger Rawdon.  She wasted her property and got a dreadful reputation. Rebecca, once a "successful" woman, became a wanderer in Europe. Unfortunately, Joseph, Amelia and Major Dobbin met with Rebecca again.  And Joseph, once more, was struck by Rebecca's beauty and became almost entirely her slave. Joseph's illness was daily increasing and died leaving one thousand pounds for Rebecca.  The younger Rawdon refused to see his mother, but allowed a generous income.  Amelia and Dobbin refused to communicate with her.  Rebecca seemed to spend her time working for the church.  That's the end of Rebecca's fate.      We have the right to blame Rebecca, but from the story we can also see that Rebecca was a person [wd3,s-] , too.   In many scenes, she and Amelia, one was in earnest and the other a perfect actress. [sn2,s-]   But she felt some pricking of conscience for her behaviour towards Amelia, the kind and simple friend who had been the first in life to defend her."  Actually, she did something helpful to Amelia in removing the bar between her and a new affection.  In this sense, she helped Amelia and Dobbin.     Therefore, I think Rebecca could have become as kind a person as Amelia.  But she didn't.  Why?  Let's see something about her early experience.     She lost both her parents when she was 17.  And at school she was treated "worse than any servant in the kitchen".  She was very clever and thought herself "a thousand times cleverer and more charming than most of the rich girls".  But she had no money, no good position.  So she got ill-treated and looked down upon.  Because of all these reasons, she went on a road leading to wealth and fame.     Rebecca's experience is a reflection of the society.  At the end of the book, there is a paragraph going like this,"  Ah! Which of us is happy in this world?  Which of us has his desire, or, having it, is satisfied? " In that society, fame, power and wealth are everything.  "Gratitude among the rich is scarcely natural."  We can imagine the life people without fame, power and wealth lived, in such a society.  So, I think, while we are blaming Rebecca, we might, or should sympathize [vp1,1-1]  her.

His mother married another man, who treated cruelly to [vp1,3-3]  him and his mother.  David's mother was a ind-hearted [fm1,-] but weak-kneed woman.  She was completely under the control of her husband.  Apart from tears, she could not do anything.  "Those who liked me did not dare to show it; those ho did not, showed it so plainly that I felt I always appeared o be anxious and dull at home. "  Here  Those [fm3,-]  who liked him: referred to Peggoty (David and his mother's servant), besides his mother.  Peggoty was a good woman and loved David deeply.     David's stepfather was so cruel that he sent David to Salem House.  The owner of the school, Mr. Creekle, was the sort of man who thought it a pleasure to punish his students.  He ordered David to put a notice "Be careful.  He bites."  on his back.  What a shameful thing for little David! "No one knew how much I suffered wearing that piece of cardboard."  It was not long before David learned  the news that his dear mother had died!  We can imagine how much David suffered!     Later, his education at Salem House ended and the cruel stepfather sent him to work at a business in the wine trade.  That place was almost a ruin.  He felt all his hopes of growing up to be an educated and respectable gentleman was destroyed.  He felt ashamed of his situation and he felt hopeless for his future.     Finally, David decided to run away from the tiring place and the tiring days.  He managed to find his only relation in the world, his aunt, Miss Beccy.  This was the most important event in David's life.  With his aunt's support, David entered a school where he was well taught and well-treated.  Again with his aunt's help, David became a lawyer at Spenlow & Jorkins.    Not long after that, David's aunt was ruined.  So David intended to find a job in addition to his work at Spenlow & Jorkins.  He worked as a secretary and got a good salary.  Later he was determined to learn to be a reporter, because he had learned that "many important and  successful men had worked as reporters for newspapers when they were young"  He worked hard for it and learned the art of being a reporter.  Meanwhile, David won an ideal marriage at last.    After going a long way and fighting a hard struggle, David Copperfield achieved his aims both in career and family.     David's story, like a long line, runs through the whole novel.  From the experience of David and the people around him, we can have a clear idea of the society of his time.  The bourgeoisie was greedy and hypocritical.  The hard-working people were living a miserable life.  To show it more clearly,  I'll talk something about the Peggotty family, and Uriah Heep, another figure.   David became a friend of the Peggotty family through his dear servant, Peggotty.  This was a completely make-up [wd3,-1]  family.  Mr. Peggotty, a generous man, supported the family.  He cared for two orphans, Ham and Emily.  Another member was Mrs.  Gummidge, the widow of Mr. Peggotty's partner in a boat.  They loved each other.  But they were often in trouble because they had no money. In spite of working hard, they could not change their fate.  It owes to the society, I think.   Of all the figures in this novel, Uriah Heep was among those who impressed upon my mind most.  I think we can't find any words better than "a wicked devil" to describe him.  He took advantage of Mr. Wickfield's weakness while Mr. Wickfield was fairy [fm1,-]  kind to him.  By a trick he became Mr Wickfield's partner in the business and took a lot of money. He made Mr. Wickfield completely controlled by him and did dishonest deeds by taking Mr. Wickfield's name.  Fortunately, he was found out and was punished.    From the comparison, we can see the two opposite world of that time.  And the story of David's success encourages us to struggle, never to give up.  I think this novel is attractive and instructive.  It makes me think a lot.  The writer, Charles Dickens, also preferred this novel.  He once said, "This is my favourite one of all my works."  

<ST 5><SEX 2><Y 8><SCH Zhongda><AGE 19><WAY 1><DIC 1><TYP 1>                                                                      A Man Can Be Destroyed But Not Defeated     This is the sentence that impresses upon my  mind most after I read the short novel, The Old Man and the Sea.  Actually, I'm deeply moved and encouraged by it.     The Old Man and the Sea  is a story of a Cuban fisherman in the gulf stream and the giant Marlin he kills and loses.  At the beginning of the story, the old man had gone eighty-four days without taking a fish.  The other fishermen, either made fun of him or were sad about him.  He was considered "salao", which is the worst form of unlucky.  However, he himself never lost the confidence and belief.    The body of the novel is about how the old fisherman fought against the nature to catch the big fish.  He spent three days and two nights at the endless sea, without salt and such necessities, without company and only talking to himself, the fish and the birds.  Moreover, his hand was cramped, bleeding.  He was not only fighting against nature, but also fighting against himself.    His words and actions show us what sort of man he was. "If he (the fish) stays down forever, then I'll stay down with him for ever"  What a patient and firm man! "  I wish I could show him what sort of  man I am.  I wish I was the fish, with everything he has against my will and intelligence."  In face of danger, he remained, or became calmer and stronger!  He himself said he was an old strange man".  But the sentence "A man can be destroyed but not  defeated."  is the exact explanation of his deeds.  because he had the firm belief in his mind, he was so brave, so strong, so optimistic!   After reading the novel, I sank into deep thought.  Someone says that The Old Man and the Sea  is not only a novel, but a fable about human being's life as well.  I strongly think so.  The deepgoing theme of the novel will have an effect on anyone who reads it.     In our everyday life, we will meet with so much difficulty. It's hard to avoid.  The most important thing is how you look on it and how you deal with it.  Some people lie down as soon as they see the shadow of difficulty, but others not. [sn2,s-]   Like the old fisherman, they fight bravely against the thistles and thorns.  They never give up halfway, never lose hope and confidence, never take[cc3,-4] their fate lying down.  Such is the true an who would rather be destroyed than be defeated.    Life is not easy for everyone.  There are always obstacles to overcome.  There is constant struggle.  To fight bravely is the only way to get through.  If one doesn't try, he will never have any chance to succeed.     The above is my impression and poor opinion [cc4,2-]  on the novel, The Old Man and the Sea. 
                                     
<ST 5><SEX 2><Y 8><SCH Zhongda><AGE 19><WAY 1><DIC 1><TYP 1>                                                                             After Reading Alice in Wonderland      Alice in Wonderland   is a world-famous reading material for children.  Being a college student, I might seem a little childish to read it.  Some of my friends laughed at me, "This is not a book for us.  It's only written to cheat the little ones." However, I don't agree with them.  After reading the book.  I'm deeply attracted by its rich imagination and naturally-shown theme.  And I think these  are the two necessary attributes for a successful story.    The story starts with Alice's falling into a dream because she didn't like the book without pictures in it . To young children, interest is the best teacher.  How can the authors make children show interest in their stories?  The essential aspect, I think, is that the story must be interesting and imaginative enough to meet the needs of children's curiosity.  lice in wonderland   is really a book full of fantastic imagination.  In the story, we can imagine the cat that disappeared in an order of tail, body, head and at last his grin.  A grin without a cat is really funny.  We can also create an image of an egg with two eyes and a nose and a mouth, the ends of whose mouth would meet behind the head when he grinned.  And I think the children will admire Alice because she could control her size by biting the left or right side of a mushroom.  How great it is!  Surely the children will be absorbed into [vp1, 2-2]  the story as they read it.  They will follow Alice's steps and find a new and unusual wonderland.     Nowadays, some people criticize cartoons saying that they limit children's imagination.  Everything has its advantages and disadvantages.  Compared with cartoons, interesting books play a more important part in making children imaginative and creative, I think.     Things that were instilled in our minds during our most impressionable years (when we are [vp6,14-2]  still children) will not be easily forgotten.  Just think back.  I'm sure nobody will deny that stories have had a deep effect on us.  The moral lessons we learned from them affected, is affecting and will affect all of us.  Therefore, a really successful story should have an instructive theme, without violence, without hatred, without sex. At this point, Alice in Wonderland  is also a successful story.    Alice treated equally on [vp1,3-3]  all the animals she met, he rabbit, the cat, the mouse, the caterpillar.  She helped the three gardeners.  If it had not been for her, they would have been killed by the Queen.  The Queen  was a boastful and cruel woman.  She was very much authoritarian, who often called out "Off with his/her head" without any reason.  But Alice wasn't frightened.  She spoke out what she wanted to say," Who is afraid of you?  You're only a card from a pack."  She didn't fall down on the Queen's face.  When she learned that the Duchess boxed the Queen's ears and was thrown into prison, Alice thought it funny.  In a word, Alice always behaved herself politely, kindly and friendly, but she never bowed to authority. Children will learn these good characters gradually as they read the story and thus the story leads children to a proper way.      The above is my opinion of a successful story after reading Alice in Wonderland.  And this book, because it's very interesting and instructive, becomes very popular all over the world.  It's a great success.  I therefore think, before the writers begin to write reading material for children, they should bear the following principles in mind -- to be interesting and instructive.

Without dreams, we would be lowspirited and the world would be dull.  But what will happen to a person if he/she has wrong dreams?   Death of a Salesman tells about the tragedy of such a man, whose name is Willy Loman, Willy firmly believes that he can become famous and wealthy on [pp1,-2]his personality. He works as a salesman for Wagner Company for as long as 34 years, with dream in mind,  But things go by contraries.  Not only has he never been well-known or rich, but also he is fired by his boss for the reason that he is too old.  Willy is lost, but he still cannot get out of the hell of his wrong dreams.  He finally commits suicide, still with the dream of fame and fortune, for he believes that his son will get $20,000 insurance for his death, thus become rich.  Wrong dreams!    If you want to analyze the tragedy of Willy, you will naturally think of its background.  Willy Loman is an ordinary American citizen living in the early 1800s.  It was a time when Dream of America -- everyone except the laziest ones can gain ame and fortune through hard work in our society" was so popular and wide-spread.  As it turned out, a large number of Americans suffered from it.  Willy Loman is a typical figure of that time.     We now know clearly that "Dream of America" is an unrealistic illusion, a deceitful progaganda [fm1,-] .  Willy's tragedy is unchangeable, on one hand, because of his own weak personality [sn9,-]on the other hand, because of the political, [sn9,-]and social conditions. Under the condition of capitalist developing [wd2,5-]  it is inevitable for the whole society to divide into two opposite group [np6,2-]  and the difference between them tends to be larger.It is impossible for every citizen to be rich. On the contrary what the majority lose is exactly what the minor capitalists get. The capitalists accumulate their fortune by means of exploiting the working class.  There is no way to avoid the contradiction in that society.     In that kind of society, some people live a luxury life without working whereas some are in rock bottom even if they work their head [np6,2-1]  off.     Such is the condition of society.  The purpose of declaring that everybody can be rich through hard work is only to find an excuse to cover the cruelty and guile of the capitalists.      But numerous Willy Lomans fell into the dream and never got out of it, thus numerous tragedies took place.  At the end of Death of a Salesman, only Biff, Willy's elder son, realizes that "He had the wrong dreams", while others still firmly believe in the dream.  That's the most miserable tragedy, I think.

He comes forward to [wd3, 4-1]  rail, looks down to [wd3,3-1]  water thoughtfully, removes his gloves, takes an ivory charm from his pocket, and holds it in his hand.    Roy sinks into deep thought.  Twenty years!  Waterloo Bridge is still Waterloo Bridge.  The good luck charm is still in his hand but Myra will never appear as twenty years ago,    Twenty years ago, just on this Waterloo Bridge, Roy met Myra for the first time and they fell in love with each other at the first sight. That evening he gave up the Colonel's dinner and made an appointment with Myra.  Though Roy had to go to the front the next day, he was quite optimistic to meet Myra again, while Myra was more or less pessimistic.  Just as Myra was upset about Roy's leaving, Roy went to see her and asked her to marry him, because he had 48 hours' leave.  Everything was going on so wonderfully.  Myra agreed and he easily got the consent of Duke. except one thing, when they got to St. Matthew's, the time for marriage  had passed.  It will never do any harm to wait just a few hours, but who will imagine that the orders suddenly changed.  Roy had to go before their planned marriage.     That leads to eternal regret.  Life was terribly hard to Myra.  She was dismissed and couldn't find a job.  Moreover, she accidentally saw the name "Roy Cronin" in column headed Fallen Officers!  Desperately, Myra became a whore to make a living.        However, Roy didn't die and returned after the war ended.  e as beside himself with joy to see Myra at the railway station.  He decided to marry Myra as soon as possible.      Myra's heart was full of contradictions.  She deeply loved y and the love was so pure that Myra would never do anything to stain it.  But she had been ... a whore! Roy was born in a noble family.  Myra painfully found that the differences between her and Roy were like a concrete wall and there was only one road before her.  Only death could prove that the love between Roy and her was loyal and pure.     Roy went to look for Myra anywhere he could think of, but he would never find her.  Only Myra's purse and its contents scattered on Waterloo Bridge.    Now twenty years have passed.  Now Roy, as a Colonel, will again go to the front -- The Second World War has broken out.    Roy's face is full of pain and resentment.  Is it just because of the loss of Myra?  I think it has deeper meanings.  Though Roy doesn't say anything, his expressions are saying his feelings silently.  Inwardly Roy is sure to have wanted to speak out, "Detestable war!  Hateful World!" 

<ST 5><SEX 2><Y 8><SCH Zhongda><AGE 19><WAY 1><DIC 1><TYP 1>     the [fm3,-]  Pursuer for[wd3,-] Equality     After reading Jane Eyre, I found that the main character of the novel, Jane Eyre, is a pursuer for [wd3,2-1]  equality.     Even as a child, Jane felt mistily that equality meant so much to her.  She struggled to leave her aunt not only because she was badly treated, but also [wd4,-]she found herself far away from the equality between her and her relations.[sn8,s]    In her aunt's house, Gateshead, she "has less right than a servant."     Although Lowood Orphanage had a much worse living condition than Gateshead, the equality that had been given to Jane strongly attracted her.  She lived an active life there and managed to gain other's respect.  She decided that "in spite of the hardness of my life,  I would not have exchanged Lowood for all the comforts of Gateshead."       Did Jane give up to pursue equality when she was employed by Mr. Rochester?  No, she didn't.  That is why she felt very pleased when she came to know that Mrs. Fairfax was a housekeeper instead of a great lady and the equality between them was confirmed.  That is why she first respected her employer and then loved him.    Altogether, Jane Eyre has [vp6,2-11]  an iron will to pursue equality, which made her more admirable.

Village girl as Tess is, she is worthy of being loved by a perfect gentleman.  It is not because of her charming appearance, but because of her noble character.  She is kind and diligent and as the oldest child in a poor family, she works hard to help her parents without a murmur.  She is pure in soul nd even is ashamed of her mother's thought that the daughter should try to marry for richness; she has a sense of self-respect and never askes [fm2,-]  her parents-in-law for help even in the darkest days.    Good as Tess is, life is never fair to her.  Working hard to earn money for her family, she is seduced by a playboy named Alec, Feeling shameful and guilty, she has and then loses her own child. Dreaming of a happy, new life, she loses her sweetheart, Angel, after he knows her past. Being hopeless, she gives her body to Alec, the man she hates. Then, facing the man she loves, she does not no longer belong to herself.[sn8,s]       "Too late, too late!'  "I say, I say it is too late!"  , reading the words from Tess's broken heart, every reader will cry for her.  At last, Tess kills Alec and flees away with Angle.  They stay together alone only three days.  After the 3-day happiness, she is executed.     Poor Tess, she spends her whole short lifetime to pursue the truth and kindness in the world, but has been struck down by the evil and sham time after time until she dies.  It is with [pp1,-] this girl and her miserable life that the author exposes the evil of the capitalist society.   Without a doubt,  Tess of the D'urbervilles is really a successful novel.

It is the excellent writing technique, I think , that makes the novel so exciting and attrative [fm1,-] .    First of all, the remarkable writing technique is showed [fm2,-]  by the angle from which the story is recounted.  Without a unique angel, the story would probably have to begin with Rebecca and Maxim's life, and then it would go on telling how Rebecca cheat [vp6,7-6]  her husband, how Maxim killed Rebecca, and how Maxim remarry [vp6,7-]  , etc. Thus, there would be two female main characters in the novel and the story is sure to be dull and boring.  In fact, the smart author made a good choice of the angle.  It seems that the whole story is told by the nameless lady, who is Maxim's second wife.  The readers are made to know the truth little by little together with the lady.  Doubtless [wd2,-s] , it makes the readers be [wd5,4-3]  burning with curiosity when they are reading.     Secondly, we can see the good writing technique through the tightnit [fm1,-]  plot of the novel.  At the beginning of the novel, the big manor Manderley is revealed to the readers through the dream of the nameless lady.  After that, all the details of the story are pulled out from the lady's memory, and they are all connected with Manderley.  Rebecca married Maxim in order to be in charge of Manderley. Maxim killed Rebecca for Manderley. And things in Manderley always makes the nameless lady feel ill at ease.  At last, the story ends with the end of Manderley.  Manderley is burnt done [vp2,s-] .  Naturely [fm1,-] , with such a tightnit [fm1,-]  plot, it is difficult for us to lose the book after we open it.     The[wd5,-] third, the description of the details is also a success. For example, when Maxim told his second wife the things about the munder [fm1,-] , he said I had to get water from the bay, I had to keep going backwards and forwards for it. There was blood all around where she lay on the floor.  The window kept banging backwards and forwards..."  From the description, it is easy to imagine Maxim's hard condition: how he madly runs backwards and forwards in the pitch-dark, how he fearfully watchs [fm2,-]  the pool of blood of the dead body [wd5,7-], and how the noise of the banging window makes his fast-beating heart beat faster.  Obviously, such vivid description strenthen  [fm1,-]  the attraction of the novel.    As we can see, to write a successful novel like Rebecca, good writing technique is really important, of great help.[sn8,s]

Heathcliff is a boy adopted by Mr. Earnshaw, who was the owner of the Wuthering Heights.  Mr. Earnshaw dotes on Heathcliff very much, which causes the envy and hatred from his son, Hindley.  but Catherine, the daughter of Earnshaw is very fond of Heathcliff.    As soon as Mr Earnshaw dies, Hindley, as the new master of Wuthering Heights, begins to treat Heathcliff cruelly.  This does not hurt Heathcliff too much because Catherine's love makes everything up.    Things changes [vp3,1-]  soon after Edgar Linton, the heir to the Thrushcross Grange, falls in love with Catherine.  Catherine as to choose.  She at last chooses Edgar with the illusion that she can use her husband's proverty [fm1,-]  to help Heathcliff.  Heathcliff could not bear it and leaves Wuthering Heights.    Three years later, Heathcliff comes back with a lot of money and a heart filled with love and hatred.  He has a plan of revenge.  First, he makes Hindley a gambler and won the whole Wuthering Heights from him.  Secondly, he makes Isabella, the younger sister of Edger his wife by means of deceiving, and then treats her badly. Thirdly, he makes Hindley's son Hareton his servant and gives him no chance of education.     Catherine, with sorrow and guity [fm1,-] , dies after her giving birth to little cathy [fm3,-] .  Heathcliff's love and hatred hasn't faded away but getting stronger and stronger.    A few years later, Heathcliff forces little Cathy to marry is on little Linton, thus, after the deaths of Edger and little Linton, he gets the provery [fm1,-]  of Thrushcross Grange.    Now, Heathcliff seems to have fulfilled his plan of revenge. But the fruit of revenge is tasteless.  With the development of the love between little cathy [fm3,-]  and Hareton, grief and regret seizes [vp3,3-1]  him by the throat tighter and tighter, and then kills [vp3,13-1]  him.      This sad story of revenge tells people that we must learn to know how to love, and we mustn't let our love give way to hatred.  The power of love is great, and if you use it wrongly, you are sure to be punished by it.

I thought the author had merely created a queer story.  However, I soon realized that It [fm3,-]  isn't a right way to read the novel forgetting the whole back-ground characteristic f the time.  I should think of what time is Hard Times talking bout.     Now, I can understand the novel much better.  I divided the people in the book into three parts [wd3,9-],they represent three different types of persons in the capitalist society of [wd4,-2]  mid-19 [fm2,-]  century. [sn1,s]    Mr Bounderby and Mr Gradgrind are typical characters of the capitalists.  They only believe money and facts.  The way Mr Gradgrind educates the children and the way Mr Bounderby treats is mother may seem incredible to us, but if we analyze the social background, we will not think it has been exaggerated.  In the middle part [wd5,3-3]  of  [wd4,5-2]  19 century, the [wd5,-6]  capitalism was still in its boyhood, we call it non-monopoly capitalism. [sn1,s] And at that time, the capitalists hadn't think of [vp6,5-]  the need to cover up their cruelty yet.  So the capitalists at [wd3,-2]  those  days are [vp6,6-]  not the same with [wd3,-]  the kind we see nowadays.     The second part [wd3,2-3]  of the people is laboring people of whom Stephen and Sissy are the representative figures. They are oppressed by the capitalists, but they are so kind, honest and lovely.  Take Stephen for example, he is a worker in Mr Bounderby's factory, only one of the "hands" in Mr Bounderby's eyes, but he is able to taste the honey of love while Mr Bounderby and Mr Gradgrind have not a sense of it.  Now, let's see how the author describes the circus people: They were simple and gentle, like children.  There was a look of honesty in their eyes, and pity too.  They were the kind of  people who like to help others -- and do not count the cost. I appreciate the author's ability to see the goodness  of the laboring people.      The third part [wd3,2-3]  of the people I would like to name them "the middle part."  Louisa, Tom and Bitzer are the suffer [np6,6-]  of the society, but they don't have the characteristic [np6,4-4]  of the laboring people, on the contrary, some of them do harm to the people. [sn1,s]    As a matter of fact, through the three parts [wd3,2-1]  of people and the relationship among them, the author drive [vp3, 2-3]  home to us the situation of the capitalist society.  And through reading the novel, I found an important way to read, that is, to think of the background all the time you are reading a novel.

In my hometown, people have similar ways as well as different ways in celebration compared with the American.    As to the similar ones, both festivals are family festivals and the traditional family dinners take important roles [cc3,3-] .  There are festival [cc4,-]reasons for people to enjoy themselves with their family and friends, too.      Apart from the similarity, the different points are easy to be seen. In my hometown, while receiving the Lucky-money, packed n a small red paper bag, from the adults, every children appily wears their new clothes to greet the new year.  In USA, not only do the children receive presents but also adults.  Children and adults exchange their gifts to show their love to each other.      Santa Claus and Chrismas [fm1,-]  tree are the symbols of hrismas [fm1,-] .  Santa Claus brings gifts to children and good ill to people at Christmas time, while Chrismas [fm1,-]  tree's evergreen would protect people from the spirit of death.  In my hometown, dragon and lion bring goodwill to people.  There are dragon-dance teams and lion-dance teams which performing [vp4,3-5]  dance of dragons and lion to people to wish everybody a "happy new year".     What's more, maybe the celebration in my hometown is bustling with more noise than [wd4,11-2]  the US, as the firecrackers can making [vp4,4-3]  very loud sound to add the joyness [fm2,-]  to the people.    From the similar points and different points of the two festivals, we can see that although people in different courtries [fm1,-]  have different customs, the cherishness [fm2,-]  of togetherness and love is their general charcter [fm1,-] .

I think this story is very interesting.  It is full of adventure, and it absorbed me very strongly.     This book mainly told us the thing that before the first [fm3,-]  world [fm3,-]  war [fm3,-]  broke out, the 'Black Stone' spy of German[wd2,-] went it[wd5,-] England to steal word [cc3,2-].In order to uncover their bad deeds , they tried to kill all the people who knew their secrets. Richard Hannay is the main person in this book.  The German spies wanted very much to get rid of him because he knew their secrets, but Hannay was a very clever and brave man.  he [fm3,-]  struggled against his enemies without any fear, and he defeated and caught the spies with his wiseness [fm2,-]  and bravery finally.    Athrough [fm1,-]  the book, I like the [wd5,2-2]  chapter ten:The House By The Sea best, because this chapter described Hannay's character most completely.  I think Hannay had four good virtues: calm, brave, use and the love of peace. [sn6,s-]   I got this from [wd4,4-1]  following.     I thought about karolides [fm1,-]  and the danger of war.  And I remembered the fear in Sir Arthur Drew's face.  I knew what I had to do.  I had to go to that house and arrest those men.  If I was wrong, I would take the blame myself." these [fm3,-]  words were said when he found the three German Spies  [fm3,-]  but couldn't be sure if they were the right men.  It showed completely his deep love of peace.  Then. [sn9,-]   Let's see [wd3,1-9]  this, the German spies lived in an English house, and the British flag was flying in the garden.  They used English names and played English games.  It seemed that they were English men, but all this couldn't fool Hannay.  On the contrary that made him more suspicious.  This point showed that he was a very wise man.  Later, when he was full of suspicious [wd2,4-]  to [pp1,5-3]  those three men, he went to their house alone and had a successful idea [cc1,-1]struggle with them,  this showed us that Hannay was also a calm and brave man. [sn1,s]     In a word, I liked the book very much, and liked Hannay very much , too.  I think he was a great hero.  Although the war broke out in 1918 at last, yet Hannay's great work should be remembered and praised, for he had  ever [wd3,2-7]  tried his best to protect the peace.  Peace is so beautiful that we all like it.  But it is not enough to only like it.  We should also protect the peace and fight against the war in our deeds.

It is the best known of her writtings [fm1,-] .     This book is a little difficult for me to read.  Because my vocabulary is poor [cc4,4-] . [sn2,s-]   There are many words I don't know. But the story is very interesting,.  I enjoyed it very much.      Mr Bennet was a country gentleman, and he had five lovely daughters.  Jane was the oldest and most beautiful one.  Elizabeth was the second of the five.  She was the most intelligent one.  Lydia was the youngest one.  And Mrs Bennet was their mother.  The thing that she cared most was to get her five daughters married.        Mr Bingley was a wealthy gentleman, who took Netherfield and lived near the Bennets'.  He lived with his two sisters and his best friend, Mr Darcy, a gentleman of a noble family.  Mr Bingley met Jane at a ball, and they fell in love at the first sight.  At first Miss Bingley and Mr Darcy thought that Jane didn't fit Mr Bingley, and tried to separate them.  But after some time,  Mr Darcy found that Mr Bingley really loved Jane, then he persuaded Mr Bingley to gain Jane's love back again.  Finally, Jane married Mr Bingley .     Mr Darcy met Elizabeth at the ball too.  At first, he thought that Eliza was not very beautiful and refused to dance with her.  But when he met Eliza the second time, he found that Eliza was clever and her eyes attracted him very much.  Then he couldn't prevent himself from loving her.  Hower [fm1,-] , he was a very proud man, and he didn't tell Eliza about his feeling to her.    Elizabeth had prejudice on [pp1,3-2]  Mr Darcy.  Because she knew that Darcy had separated Mr Bingley and her dear sister Jane. [sn2,s-]   And Mr Wickham, an officer, who was the godson of Mr Darcy's father, told Eliza that Darcy had taken the fortune which Wickham should have.  The two things made Eliza dislike Darcy very much.  So when Darcy expressed his love to Eliza, she refused him directly and told him about her feeling to him.  When Darcy knew it, he wrote a letter to Eliza and explained the two things.  After that, Eliza found that she had misunderstood Darcy, then she began to love Darcy.    In fact, Mr Darcy was a very good man, though he was so proud. He helped Miss Lydia to marry Mr Wickham.  And he didn't tell Eliza what  good he had done to Eliza's family.  But Eliza found the fact out herself.  Then she loved Darcy more.  In the end.  Eliza agreed to marry Darcy and began their happy life.   The happy ending made me so happy.

This novel uncovered the realities of English [wd3,6-]  in the Middle [fm3,-]  of the 19th Century.  It gave much sympathy to the ordinary people, and it is a novel that reflected the oppressed women's life [wd3,-1]  conditions and spirits.  Jane Eyre just is the typical woman in the book. Her advanced spirits [cc4,2-]  moved me deeply.     The story of <<Jane Eyre>> [sn9,-]   happened in an English countryside in the middle Century [cc4,3-] .  The main charactor [fm1,-]  Jane Eyre has a poor life experience.  She lost her parents when just a little child and was sent to her uncle's to e brought up.[sn,s]. Unfortunately, her aunt and cousin treated her badly,.  But Jane Eyre, a girl who has a [np7,-2] innate resistible [wd3,-1]  spirit.[sn2,s-]  Although she is still very young, she put up resistance to her cousin and aunt.  Now I still learly remember her words to her aunt: "You told Mr Bracklehurst that I had a bad character, and I'll let everyone at Lowood know what you are, and what you have done.   'Deceit is not my fault!'    These words will never come out from an ordinary child's mouth.  Jane Eyre was an especially [wd2,1-1]  people [wd3,5-]  and her this [np9,2-1]  character protected her majesty.  I admire her heartfeltly [fm1,-] .     Besides, Jane Eyre is also a kind-hearted female.  After she was sent to Lowood, although she continued suffering from the torment, to her joy, she got to know a girl called Helen -- a kind and staunch girl similar to her.  They made friends [vp2, 3-2]  each other.  Helen's fate is more poor [aj3,4-2]  than Jane [np4,s-] .  Jane gave much sympathy to her.  When she was dying, and not allowed to see anyone, Jane managed to see her, and slept with her in one bed, accompanying her to her last night.  When she grew up to be a young lady, she became a governess of Mr Rochester's.  Jane and her master Rochester have [vp6,5-10]  the same interests and spirits.  They loved each other deeply.  But then Jane left Rochester because she heard of [vp1,2-7]  that he had already had a wife.  The strength of love is great.  Jane Eyre loved Rochester.  She couldn't cheat herself.  So, she returned again to look for Rochester.  But, to her sorrow, Rochester was seriously wounded in a big fire set by her [pr1,10-1]  wife.  He was blind and lost one hand.  Jane Eyre, such a kind lady, didn't care for [vp2,15-1]  this a bit and got married with [pp1,2-1]  Rochester determinedly.  When I read here, I was moved to tears, for her kind-heart [fm2] and unfortune fate.[sn8,s]      <<Jane Eyre>> [sn9,-]   is really an immortal works [np6, -] .  The writer made the ordinary poor woman as the good person in the novel, and highly praised her for her struggles which fought [vp7,2-7]  for the equal position and happy life.   like this great works [np6,2-] .

But the next morning, he found that the office he used to work in was locked and he cried in vain to get any information about the Red-Headed League.  The job was  good indeed, so Mr Wilson asked Holmes to find out why the Red-Headed League had disappeared suddenly.    Holmes asked Mr Wilson for all the details and thought carefully.  Then he went to the place where Mr Wilson lived with Watson, his good  friend.  After carefully studying, Holmes  considered that a great crime must happen.[sn,s].   Finally, with the help of the police and   Wilson,  Holmes prevented the thieves from stealing three thousand pounds from the bank.    Holmes just used one day to discover and prevent a great crime.  How would he do [vp6,15-]  that?  He was so careful that he did not want to miss any details.  For example, when Mr Watson told him that his shopman spent too much time in Watson's cellar,  Holmes realized that the man was suspicious.  Then, through his carefully [wd2,1-1]  examination, he finally found a bank behind Mr Wilson's shop.  He knew that the man must be digging  a tunnelin Wilson's cellar.     The story is not only interesting but also educational.  I'm a very careless girl.  After I finished reading the stories, I have determined to be moved [wd3,5-1]  careful.  I'll try my best to be a good girl with carefulness and thoughtfulness.                                      

<ST 5><SEX 2><Y 8><SCH Zhongda><AGE 19><WAY 1><DIC 1><TYP 1> Treasure Island   Treasure Island was written by Robert Stevenson, an English novelist.  The novelist was famous for his adventure stories.        This book is different from other four novels I have read.  It's an attractive adventure story.    The adventure began with the map of Treasure Island, where a large quantity of treasure was hidden, and the map showed the spot.    A lot of pirats [fm1,-]  wanted to get the map, but a boy named Jim got it by chance.  Then a term [wd3,1-8]  including Mr Trelawney, Dr Livesey and Jim himself set off to the Treasure   Island.  On board, the staff got divided.  Due to the temptation of the Treasure, [np7,-2]  fight began.  Seventeen men had been killed before they found the treasure.  Jim had a narrow escape.  He was almost killed if Ben, who met Jim on the Island  hadn't come in time and saved him.  In fact, Ben had found the treasure.        After many adventures, only five men remained during the searching [wd3,1-3]  for the treasure.  In the end they shared the treasure.      Treasure always has great temptation to people.  In the story, everyone revealed his nature in duelling.  They would rather give their lives to get the treasure.  In today's world, endless misery has resulted from the love of money.  I read this sentence in a magazine.  I think it is very correct and true.  Money makes some people become greedy and try to get it by illegal means.  I think we should treat money correctly.  Money is important, this is true, but it is not money that can bring us everything.  There are many more important things which is [vp3,3-4]  more important than money,what's more, they can not be bought with money.  We should seek the most important thing: advanced spirits [cc4,2-] . [sn1,s] 

<ST 5><SEX 2><Y 8><SCH Zhongda><AGE 19><WAY 1><DIC 1><TYP 1> The Three Musketeers     Several days ago, I read a novel  "The Three Musketeers". This story took place in France from 1625 to 1628.  The mainly [wd2,1-1]  contradiction in the story is the antagonism between the cardinal and Treville, perhaps also between France and England.  After finishing this novel, I didn'tunderstand the background clearly.  I feel the plots of it is a little disordered and some thing and person haven't origin [wd3,-]or suddenly disappear without being know why. So, I can't say some interesting things about the story, but it seems that there are several people in the story having a lot of personality.[sn,s].   I think I  can only say something about this point.    There is a famous saying: "The times produce their heroes. "  At that times [wd3,2-]  in this novel the heroes are those three Musketeers.  They are Prothos.  Athos and D"Artagnan.Among them, I like Athos best.  I think he is the most clever,  calm musketeer.  I found this in several things [wd3,7-] .  One, Milady sent the poisonous wine to D'Artagna to drink, but D'Artagnan himself didn't know where the wine come [vp6,7-1]  from, actually.  When Porthos wanted to drink it, it was Athos who stopped him from doing such a foolish thing.  He said:  "Do not let us foolishly drink wine from an unknown giver. "  He is very cautious.  Two, when he knew that Milady was in the RED DOVECOT INN, he thought out a good idea to deceive the Cardinal and met Milady successfully.  Facing Milady, he discovered her guilty [wd2,1-]  without mercy although she was his wife and used his terrible cold and firm voice to force Milady to hand out the paper that Cardinal signed.  That paper gave them much help later.  That showed Athos was brave, clever and calm.     D'Artagnan is also a very outstanding person.  His activity, his courage and his understanding were similar to Athos, but maybe he was too young, so he acted a little recklessly sometime.      Porthos was more minor [aj3,1-]  than Athos and D'Artagnan in the novel.  He is [vp6,1-s]  also brave, but I think he was not clever, and not cautious enough.    In a word, this novel is successful in the person's [cc1,-]mould. That is my deepest impression about the novel.

<ST 5><SEX 2><Y 8><SCH Zhongda><AGE 19><WAY 1><DIC 1><TYP 1> Rebecca    Several years before, I've been told that "Rebecca" was a good novel.  But I've never read it.  Today, I finished this novel and felt that it enjoys the well-deserved reputation indeed.  It was written by [np7,4-3]  English female novelist Daphne du Maurier.  This  novel has a very obvious characteristic that it can catch reader's  heart tightly by its reader [cc1,-]involvement.  It was named "the first reader involvement novel in the world."  The writer had her particular literary skill.  Rebecca who is taken for the novel's name has never appeared, but exits everywhere.  The real female leading character only sets off Rebecca.    The femal [fm1,-]  leading character "I" was a lady who hasn't any relations and was hired as a companion for a nobel [fm1,-]  woman.  In parice [fm1,-] , she falled [fm2,-]  in love with Maxim at the first sight and married him hurrily [fm1,-] .    After the honeymoon, they came back to Manderley.  The housekeeper Mrs Danvers don't [vp3,2-4] [vp6,2-8]   like the new hostress[fm1,-] because she admired Rebecca with a morid [fm1,-]  psychology [wd3,6-] .  At a fancy dress dance, Mrs Danvers cheated the new hostress [fm1,-]  and asked her to dress as a nobel [fm1,-]  woman that in the picture.[sn,s].   This thing [wd5,1-5]  caused a disaster to her.  Mr Maxim was very angry with her that time.  Some day, Mrs Danver said to her face to face that she couldn't compare with Rebecca for ever.  Maxim loved Rebecca deeply and didn't love her at all. These words hurted [fm2,-]  the simple lady very much.  She wrongly thought that Maxim didn't love her, so she was not intimate to him.    Later, a diver unexpectly [fm2,-]  found Rebecca's boat and body in the sea.  At this [wd3,1-s]  time, Maxim finally told the bride that he didn't love Rebecca.  Rebecca was actually a cynical unconventional and unrestrained woman.  Maxim felt he couldn't bear her dirty deeds.  One night, in the house that near the bay, [sn8,s] Rebecca who knew she had a [np7,-1]  incurable disease cheated Maxim that she was expecting a baby not his, Maxim was very angry and killed her.  The bride then knew the fact in the end, and she was not miserable any more. she [fm3,-]  knew Maxim loved her and so she gave him much warmth and comfort. She helped him live though the difficult time.  During this most difficult time, their love developed.  Good man always get [vp3,3-3]  the good result.  Though a [np7,-1]  investage [fm1,-]  to this criminal case.  The judge announced that Rebecca was killed by herself for she knew she has [vp6,9-3]  a incurable disease.[sn,s].   Maxim won.    Finished [vp5,-s]  the lawsuit, Maxim and his bride drove back to Manderey.  When they arrived, they found fire [cc1,-]sea was covering Manderey.  The big fire was destroying it to ruins, but at the same time, I think the fire was also chasing away Rebecca's dirty and disappeared [wd3,3-1]  soul.   I think this is a good ending.  Although the explendid [fm1,-]Manderey was ruined, the love between Maxim and his bride was deepened.  They can built[vp4,2-]  a new house and begin their new life. Wish them happiness!

It took the Holland bourgeois revolution in the seventeenth Century [fm3,-]  as its background.  It described a love story between a young prisoner and a girl: Doctor Van Baerle was put in prison because of one political thing [wd3,s-] .  In prison, he knew and fell in love with the daughter of the prison-keeper -- Rosa.  Their love was pure and deep.     In this novel, the female leading actor [wd3,6-]  Rosa impressed me very much.  She was a beautiful, clever, brave and kind girl.    Rosa didn't know Cornelius De Witte and his brother John, but when she saw solders moved away and the people would kill the two brother [np6,1-] , she offered the [np7,3-3]  help to them and let them run away. this showed her kindness.    Rosa didn't receive [wd4,3-1]  education, so she couldn't read.  later, Van Baerle taught her,she learned very quickly and soon could write simple but full-meaning letters [cc4,2-] [sn1,s]showed that she was clever.    Rosa was only an eighteen-year old girl, but she was very brave.  When she found that her black tulip was stolen, she went to the house of Mr Van Herysen, President of the Flower-growers and told him that Isaac Boxtel had stolen her black tulip. But Boxtel was a fox [wd3,1-1]  man, he made the President and Prince blevie [fm1,-]  him. [sn1,s] Although there was much difficulty, Rosa didn't give up.  She took a brave struggle against Boxtel.  In the end, because of her brave [wd2,1-2]and wisdom, she got back the black tulip and even saved her lover, Baerle.    The end of this novel is a happy one.  Boxtel answered for his bad deeds and died; Rosa and Baerle got married, just as I expected.

Among them, "The woman [fm3,-]  in white" is the best one , and it was this novel that brought him the fame.     The young painter, Walter Hartright was hired by Mr Faile to serve as a drawing teacher of Mr Faile's two niece [np6,1-] .  The deep night of leaving for Limmeridge, he met a woman in complete white and helped her get rid of the pursuite [fm1,-] . When he arrived at Limmeridge and saw one of his students-beautiful Laura, he fell in love with her at the first sight.  Meantime, he was surprised to find that Laura was very like that woman in white.  He told this to Laura's sister, Miss Halcombe.  They began to do something to find out the secret.  After a long-time investage [fm1,-], They [fm3,-]  found out the truth; The woman in white called [vp7,4-2]  Anne Catherick.  She knew a fatal secret of Sir Percival.  So Percival put her into private anslym.Now she had fled out and people could not know where she was exactelly [fm2,-] .  That Persival happened to be the man whom Laura was engaged to and would marry him soon after.[sn,s].   In fact, the purpus [fm1,-]  Percival wanted to marry Laura was to get her possetion [fm1,-] .He and his friend Fosco made up Laura to be Ann Catherick and put her into the anslym.  At the same time, they lied to people that Laura had died and took Ann's body to hold a Fudal [fm1,-]  (Ann died of a sudden heart attack). So, all people thought that Laura had died, and Percival achieved his aim to herit [fm1,-]  her possetion [fm1,-] .    Hartwight who loved Laura deeply all the time came back from abroad and had a deep and close invest  [wd3,4-4] [cc4,5-]  of Percival and Fosco.  He was very clever, [wd4,4-1]  brave.  With Miss Halcombe's great help, finally, made all things clear up.[sn8,s]     According to the end, Percival and Fosco both answered for their guilty deeds and died.  Hartwight and Laura got married and lived a happy life.   It's a happy end, just as I expected.  After reading this novel, I was very happy too.

In other words [sn9,-]  the accused is held innocent until proved guilty.  In the murder case we can't prove the boy's guilty because so many reasonable doubts emerge and no one can explain them rationally: [sn9,-]   It seems to be quite possible for the boy to commit [vp1,-3]  murdering his father owing to the fierce conflict between them.  But the conflict isn't enough to prove he was inexorably [wd2,2-3]  to commit [np7,11-1]  murder. One and another one doubt suggest themselves.[sn,s].  No one, including the two main witnesses, could prove he's guilty .     As an important witness, the old man's testimony is unbelievable.  We can easily  pick up two obvious pick holes in his testimony.  Firstly [sn9,-]  he said that he heard the boy and his father quarrel fiercely in the upstairs department [wd1, 3-] . He heard the boy say to his father, "I'm going to kill you." A second later he heard a body falling.  It's said that at that moment an elevated train was passing by, which is [vp6,7-1] roaring past his nose.  The noise was too loud and awful for him, such an old man, to hear anything.  He told a lie.  Secondly, he claimed that when he heard the body fall, he got up and went down the hall to the front door.  He opened it and looked out in time to see the boy runing [fm2,-]  down the stairs.  The distance from his bed to the front door is sixty-three feet six inches.  How can an old man as [wd3,5-1]  him with two canes walk such a distance in 15 minutes?   He is a liar.  We can't believe a word he said.      As to another major witness who claimed that she saw the under commiting [vp5,4-] , we  can also pick up pick holes in her testimony.  She said she was unable to sleep that night and happened to look into the window which is [vp6,7-]  right across from hers across the EL track at top speed.  And she saw the boy stab his father.  A second later the lights went out.  She had no time to put on her glasses.  That's  for sure.  So it's impossible for her to see clearly what happened in the room where the murder took place.  Her testimony is also weak and doubtful.       Since no one and no evidence can prove the boy's guilty, he is innocent.

So is our lunar New Year.  The western holiday and our tranditional [fm1,-]  Spring Festival are much similar.     As the Christmas [wd4,3-1]  coming, cities and towns deck  their streets with bells, garlands of evergreens and glittering decorations.  On almost every front door hangs some red and green symbol of the Christmas season such as a fragrant evergreen bough tied with a red bow.  In China, you also feel the air of  New Year in the streets.  In my hometown, the trees, along the bank or lined [wd5,4-2]  the streetside, are strung with twinkling electric lights.  The shops hang the big red lanterns in front of the door [np6,11-] .  The buildings set up colourful frags [fm1,-]  waving in the wind.[sn,s].    Both the western people and eastern people are busy during the important holiday [np6,12-] .  The western people are busy in sending cards, buying Christmas tree [np6,5-] , trimming the tree [np6,7-]  and decorating the house [np6,10-] .  In my hometown, people are busy in buying new clothes, preparing things for  [np7,3-2]  new year.          Music literally fills the air at Christmas and [np7,-2]  Spring Festival.  Carols sung by church choirs, by school children express the joyous [wd2,2-2]  of people.  In my hometown the special songs sung in New Year are often heard from the recorder at shops, in [pp2,-1]  home [sn9,-]  while you are walking in [np7,2-1]  street.[sn,s].   Happiness fills everyone's heart.     Both Christmas and [np7,-2]  Spring  Festival are family festivals. Going home for Christmas  and going home for [np7,-2] Spring Festival are customs.  No distance seems too far away if it enables one to join the family circle for the holiday.  Parents welcome home their children and grandchildren.  On Christmas Eve, the family will has [vp4,3-]  a great meal including turkey, toasted duck, pies, [wd4,5-1]  puddings.  In our hometown, we also have the grand dinner on New Year's Eve including chicken, goose, [wd4,3-1]  fish.  We also make some special cakes for the New Year.     During the Christmas and [np7,-2]  Spring Festival, the children are the happiest group [wd5,4-] .  In the west [fm3,-] , the children receive the [wd5,2-2]  Christmas presents.  In China, children receive money from the older members in the family.   They go out in new clothes together to let off firecrackers and have a good time.    Comparing Christmas and [np7,-2]  Spring Festival, they both are the [wd5,3-3]  festivals for jubilation.

As a student, I always hope I can do well in it.  I also hope we can get some improvment [fm1,-]  this year.    First, we need detailed explanation and guidance.  The subject requests us to pay more attention to the details of the text.  We need help to answer [vp1,-2]  to questions we raise while we are reading the text.  Moreover, we need the guidance to appreciate the style of the article which is becoming more and more important.    Secondly, we can add some outside knowledge in class.  As a student  who majors in English, we [pr1,7-]  can't just focus on the language itself.  It is good to talk about some cultures, backgrouds [fm1,-]  and customs related with the text before or after we study it.  I think it can expand our knowledge.     Thirdly, we can hold some discusses [wd2,4-]  sometimes in class.  We can get a deeper understanding about  the text's theme.  On the other hand, we break the ice and become more active in class.  At the same time, we pratise our oral English.      Fourthly [sn9,-]   the suitable exercises make us to master the knowledge [cc3,3-]  we have learned [cc3,4-] .  Practice makes perfict [fm1,-] .  During the exercises, we make good use of the knowledge.  The pressure that comes from the homework offer [vp3,7-]  us the power to make progress.     Intensive Reading is not so difficult as we thought if we put our heart into it.  I'm sure I can do it better this term.

No doubt that he had contributed a lot to the world.  After reading the text Galileo, the Stargazer Who Defied the World,  I have known more about this great man.  In my view, Galileo is a seeker and fighter.     Galileo is a seeker.  He devoted his whole life to seeking for the truth.  As a curious and observant boy, he was eager to probe the mystery of the world.  He never took anything for granted.  He found out the truth through his own experiments.  He himself devised tests to examine and prove his hypothesises [fm2,-]  and conclusions.  He had never believed any theory unless he found the facts to support [wd4,11-] .  Galileo's dedication to his pursuit of truth and his rebellion to Aristotle earned himself a great trouble at that Dark Ages.[sn,s].   But he insisted [vp1,-2]  his belief all along. Even when he was compelled to renounce his opinions, he didn't give up his experiments privatly [fm1,-]  and stuck to his belief in his heart.     Galileo is also a fighter .  As he was carrying out his experiments, he was fighting against the sneers of his students, he jealousy and hatred of his colleagues and the persecution of he Inquisition.  Undaunted by the antagonism of these people, Galileo continued his studies.  His keen belief on the truth gave him courage and power to fight against the prejudices.  He had succeeded.  Not only had he become famous at that time, but also his contribution to the science was approved today.     Galileo's story is far more than inform us the life of the great scientist.[sn,s].   It arouses our admiration for his sincerity to [pp1,1-2]  the science, his courage to the knowledge and his quality.[sn,s].

There are still reasonable doubts about the murder.     First, let's talk about the knife.  That's an unusual knife and the storekeeper have [vp3,2-1]  identified it and said it was the only one of its kind he had.  My client had bought the knife from him as a present to his friend.  Unfortunately, he lost the knife on the way home and it is the same as the one which was stabbed into his father by chance.  But it proved nothing.  Maybe there are then [fm1,-]  knives like that.  It is the only one in that store, but how about in the other junk shops?  So it can't proved [vp4,2-]   that only [ad1,-s] there is one knife in the case.  My client lost the knife and someone else stabbed his father with the knife just like it.     Secondly, let's review the testimony of the neighbour who lived under my client and his father's home.  He claimed after my client was beaten, he heard him yell, "I'm going to kill you. "  A second later, he heard the body falling.  And he saw my client running out of the house 15 seconds after that.  The man is [vp6,2-5]  lying.  He made himself believe he told the truth. Let's take a look at that picture.  When the murder happened,  a [np7,-1]  EL train passed the room in which the killing took place.  We proved that when our window was open and the train went by, the noise was so awful that we couldn't hear ourselves think.  We also proved [wd5,2-2]  have proved that it took at least 10 seconds for a train to pass a given point or two seconds per car.And we had another witness see the killing and the body fall through the windows of the last two cars of the five-car train.  So that EL train had been going by the man's window for at least 6 seconds before the body fell.  The man couldn't had [vp4,3-1]  heard my client's  saying "I'm going to kill you" while the front of the train was roaring past his nose.  He couldn't heard [vp4,2-4]  it with the noise.  But suppose he did hear it.How many times has [vp3,3-4]  each of you said "I'll kill you?" Probably, hundreds.  We say it every day but it doesn't mean that we're really going to kill someone. And do you think that my client would shout a thing like that so that the whole neighbour [wd3,4-2]  could hear?  Everyone is much too bright to do that.  On the other hand, the witness also said that he saw my client beat it downstairs 13 seconds after the killing.  It's impossible.  For you see, the witness is a man who can only walk very slowly with canes and he even needs help to get into the witness chair.  And when the killing happened, he was in bed in his room.  We have proved that if he wants [wd4,3-4]  reach the front door, he have [vp3,1-]  to get out of bed, get his canes, walk 12 feet to the bedroom's door, open it, walk 43 feet to the front door and open it.  How can it be possible for an old man like him to finish such a  long walk in 15 seconds. [sn9,-]   It take's [fm2,-]  at least 39 seconds for an old person with canes to walk 40 feet. It's been proved. So the man was trying to get to the front door and as [wd4,1-8]  heard someone running down the stairs, he assumed it was my client.     Thirdly, let's think of the downward angle of the stub wound. My client is five feet eight inches tall while his father was six two.  There is a difference of 6 inches.  It's very hard to stab down into the chest of someone who's taller than you are.  My client would have to move his hand above his shoulder.  Anyone  who's ever used a switch knife would never have stabbed  downhanded[fm1,-].  So my client wouldn't have made the kind of would [wd7,8-4]  to kill his father as he had some experience with the switch knives.     Fourthly, let's think over another's witness's declaration.  She said that she went to bed about 11 o'clock that night.  Her bed was next to the open window.  She could see right into the window across the tracks.  She tossed and turned for over an hour, unable to sleep.  Finally she turned towards the window at about twelve ten .  As she looked out, she saw my client knife his father.  I would say that she did see the murder through the window, but she couldn't have seen that  the murderer was my client.  She wears glasses.  Let's not forget it.  No one wears glasses to bed.  So she wasn't wearing glasses in bed while tossing and turning.  She looked out [wd4,3-2]  the window and saw the murder taking place and the light went out a second later.  She couldn't have time to put on her glasses.  What she saw was only a blur.  She just thought she saw my client kill his father.     Basing on the four reasonable doubts thereinbefore, I beg the jurors to turn over the case and vote my client not guilty.  That's all.

Intensive reading in freshman year was quite boring not only because the book was a little outdated, but because the way in which the teacher taught was so simple and direct.  All we had to do on this subject was to check out the new words in the text, and to listen to the teacher to analyse some grammar points in the text, and finally to finish the exercises of the text.    I'm [vp6,-5]  afraid, before the term began, that the procedure in intensive reading courses will [vp6,s-]  continue.     To my great joy, changes has [vp3,1-]  taken place in the subject.  The greatest one is that our teacher has changed the way of teaching. We now have to do a lot of preparation before the text [wd3, 2-1] begins.  We have to know something about the background, the characters, etc.  I thought that these [pr1,-1]  preparation would help us know further the details of the text and would enlarge our horizon [cc3,3-] , though  we have to spend more time and energy on the preparation.  I appreciated particularly the section our teacher leads us to speak.  I thought that learning to express the feeling in English was an important target for us especially when we were in sophomore year.  Though we sometimes were too shy to open our mouths and left our teacher in embarrassment, we indeed wanted to practise our oral English.     What I expected the intensive reading courses to be in the future is that we should do more discussions [cc3,3-]  in class and have more chances to open our mouths to speak English.  I thought that maybe both [np7,5-6]  teacher and students could think of some questions and delemmas [fm1,-]  for us to discuss. According to the details of the text, we can put us [pr4,3-1]  into the situation of the text, and think, if we are [vp8,s-]  the character in the text, what we will do [vp8,s-] .     In a word, the intensive reading course in my mind is a comprehensive course.    

<ST 5><SEX 2><Y 8><SCH Zhongda><AGE 20><WAY 1><DIC 1><TYP 2>  Character Sketch of Galileo    As a great scientist, Galileo posessess [fm1,-]  the character a scientist should have -- talence [fm1,-]  and perseverance.    When he was 18 years old, he observed the swinging of a lamp in a church by chance and discovered an important theory in the science history.  From this, we can tell that Galileo was a talented person with keen observation which should be the essential ability of a scientist.    But what made him a great scientist in history is, besides the talence [fm1,-] , his perseverance. [sn9,-]   In the period of time during which Galileo lived, religion occupied a powerful role [cc3,4-]  in the society religious authority stood beyond the government. [sn1,s] They owned their court and could judge whether a guy was vicious or not.  Under the pressure of the religion, many scientists had to bow before it, and gave up their belief.     Galileo was threatened by the Inquisition as well when he wrote a book and agreed with the viewpoint of Copernicus', but he didn't give in.  He tried his best to prove the theory and to persuade the Pope to accept his theory.     During the time from 1592 to 1610, Galileo moved to the University of Padua.  There, he got a free environment to continue his research.  He was successful at that time.    In 1610, Galileo gave up the comfortable and safe life in the University of Padua and went back to Pisa.  He tried hard to introduce his theory to the Inquisition but failed.    He was forced to obey the Pope's orders but continued his research secretly in very bad conditions.    Galileo's theory was admitted [cc3,4-]  by the Pope of Rome in 1979.  His perseverance got [wd3,2-1]  successful at last.

My Dad     When I began to write this article, I wondered what information I would get from my memory about my father because, sometimes, Dad seemed so  strange to me.[sn,s].      What does my father look like?  Dad was [vp6,7-]  one of the most ordinary kind of people with few words.  The deepest impression about him in my mind  was [vp6,8-]  his always [ad2, 1-2]  rough  [wd3,-1]  face.  In my childhood, I was usually too scared to look [vp1,-1]  him in the face.  Each time when we were together, I just wanted to escape from him.         Common as he was, I wouldn't find anything particular about my father to brag before my classmates.  Sometimes I would feel shamed [wd3,3-3]  of his ordinariness.  I would ask myself whether I would choose to be his son if I had the chance before I was born.  Also, it seemed that he didn't care about me  much and just let me go my own way.  There must be a gap between us, I  always thought.     An episode happened and changed my perception [wd3,-] towards dad.  It was just after I had received the notice that I was accepted by Zhongshan University that a  banquet was held. All of my relatives came to congratulate me on it.  At [pp1, -2]  that night, I was  so surprised to find dad singing songs and talking loudly and excitedly all the time.  He wasn't the one he used to be.  What astonished me most was that father got drunk that night, for as  a bus driver, he never drank more than a little glass of beer.     I felt something unusual  about dad that night.  It seemed that something which he had hidden in his heart for a long time bursted [fm2,-]  out.  And I found the things I had neglected or so many years at [pp1,-2]  that night.    I knew he was proud of me, and I was proud to have a father like him as well.  I will be his son. Forever.

Galileo     Galileo  was born in Pisa, Italy in February, 1564.    He was the famous physicist all over the world when he was 19,he made his first important discovery-the Isochronism of Pendulum, by chance, which is applied today in the measurement of time, the eclipses of the sun, and the movement of the stars. [sn1,s]      Galileo had even been a professor of Mathematics in the University of Pisa.  During that time, he challenged the great Aristotle's theories by conducting an experiment regarding the laws of bodies in motion and got the famous theory that two different weights dropped simultaneously from the same height, would fall to the ground at the same time.     While in Padua, Galileo had written a book concerning the movement of heavenly bodies.  He favored Copernicus theory which declared that the earth is [vp6,5-2]  a planet which revolves [vp6,8-1]  around  a fixed sun.  For to do so, he was be delivered to the torture  Chamber of Inquisition.[sn,s].

I am a graduate of Zhongshan University, majoring in English. I have a good command of English, and I have the ability [np1, 4-4]  of dealing with problems well.  Moreover, I had [vp6,11-3] the experience of being a town [wd3,1-1]  guide as a part-time job when I was a junior in school.

I should be much obliged for your favorable consideration and the chance for an interviews [np6,1-] .

Jury [wd3,-4]  8 gives the points that the boy is innocent  and at the end, all the juries [wd3,2-3]  agree with him and now all the reasonable doubts will present following: [,s]   The [wd5,-8]  first, what the old man said is impossible, because it will take an old, crippled man to walk from his bed to his front door at lease 39 seconds instead of 15 seconds.[sn,s].  The second point is that the woman across the street couldn't see the murder committed, because she saw only a blur through the windows of the last two cars of the EL in 10 seconds without her glasses; [sn9,-]  The third is that the boy is five feet eight inches tall.  His father was six-two.  That's a different of six inches[sn8,s-]. It's very hard to stab down into the chest of someone who's taller than you are, and then the boy wouldn't have made this kind of wound that killed his father.     At the same time, these petty doubts [cc4,2-] , [sn2,s-] when the EL had been going by the old man's window, he shouldn't heard  [vp4,2-]  the boy say, "I'm going to kill you."  because to noise[wd7,-] is awful, we can't hear ourselves think. [sn1,s] But suppose he did hear it, "I'll kill you? [sn9,-] " We say it every day, this doesn't mean that we're really going to kill someone and we will metion [fm1,-] the knife which isn't exactly belong to some-one else could have stabbed the father with a knife just like it, because we can buy the same one in the junk shop whenever and  wherever.[sn,s]. [sn1,s]   So summing all [np7,3-2]  above up, we can draw a conclusion that the boy is innocent.

So before you consider which you are fit for, science or language, you have to know the different approaches to science and language.    Firstly, the ways of thinking are quite different in these two kinds of study.  You notice that science students usually consider the feasibity [fm1,-]  of things while language students firstly take his [pr1,5-]  own feeling [np6,6-],  like [np6,7-]  or dislike [np6,9-]  into consideration.  The study of science is more logical.  For everything you have to find [wd3, 6-1]  course  [wd3,6-9]  and try to infer a result from the course [wd3,7-] .  However, as for language  study, you should be more sentimental [wd3,9-] .  Apart from vocabulary and grammar our should put your heart into the works, together with the author's heart, otherwise you can not share the feelings and thoughts with the author or preciate [fm1,-]  the works.     Secondly, language study demands a more pratical [fm1,-]  way than the study of science.  Because language is a tool  by [pp1,4-7]  which you communicate with the outside world, a [np7, -2]  efficient way for you to adquire [fm1,-]  the communicative skills is to use it as much as you can.  As for science study not that means you needn't try to apply the knowledge to the daily life,the present preeminent task is to have a deep understanding of the theories of your subject and do experiments to test them. [,s] [sn1,s]           Anyway all subjects have something in common.  No matter what you are going to study and what you will study, if you want to learn it well, you should have the interest and be hard working. What's more, don't limit yourself in [pp1,3-5]  the field of your major and try to enlarge the horizon [cc3,3-] .  Remember knowledges [np5,1-3]  are always relative.

No longer speaking like a shy girl, the sun looked so peaceful and composed.  Grandma and I was walking in the twilight, enjoying the sunset.  When I was a little girl.  I used to go out for a walk with Grandma after supper.  But after I went to high school, I had to spend more time on my study, and now, studying in Guangzhou, [sn3,-s]  the time to be with Grandma was getting less and less. [sn1,s]  I held Grandma by the arm and obviously felt that she was now an old woman.  Time had slowed her steps and bumped her back.  Several times when walking with me, Grandma turned to me and found surprisedly [fm2,-]that my shoulder was higher than hers.  Each time she laughed and said, "Oh, you see, I've got old.[sn8,s]. But it's rally a great thing to see you've grown up!  And it sometimes reminds me of the past time [wd5,5-]  when you were just little girls."    Every time Grandma said these, I always slipped back in time to my childhood and remember [vp6,10-]  many things  Grandma had told me when walking. Grandma was born in a small village.  As any other  girl in that village. [sn2, s-] She recieved [fm1,-]  no education and just did housework and farmwork all day long.  When reaching her early twenties, Grandma was married to Grandpa, who, [sn9,-]  she didn't ever seen [vp6,9-]  before. All the things were determined by thers[fm1,-], which people took for granted. Then, desterny [fm1,-]  made Grandma a joke [vp2,4-]  which was so serious that she could almost [wd3,7-3]  not bear it.  When Father was only 8 months old, Grandpa passed away and left them for ever [fm2,-] . t's hard to imagine the hardness Grandma encountered when she tried  to bring up Father by her own hands, standing some people's bully [cc3,4-] . Tilling the land was far from enough to make a liveing [fm2,-] .  After getting up early in the morning, Grandma climbed up the hill, wearing straw sandals and a little package containing some rice and a yam bean as lunch, cut the grass and then sell [vp6,26-]  them [pr1,6-]  in the market. Sometimes when she finished cuttitheirst was also in the twilight, Grandma stood up after bending for such a long time, gazed at the winding way [wd3,2-]  towards the hill top and found all her companies had family members to come to help them.[sn,s].[sn1,s] But Grandma, alone, stood in the glow of the sunset.  She was at a loss.  However, even so, Grandma never wanted Father to help her. She was not willing to take Father's time from his study.  To her, the greatest happiness was to see Father's good score.  In rainy days, Grandma also kept working.  She liked it most to watch Father studying while herself [pr4,1-2]  was spinning [fm2,-] .  No matter how hard it was, for better or worse [wd7,3-], Grandma determined [vp1,1-4]  to ring up  Father, gave him education and let him step out of the  poverty-stricken land. Grandma's dream came true after enduring for over 20 years. She came to town with my parents and life was getting better and better.  And then my sister and I came to the world.  Since then, Grandma had put her heart into us. But I knew Grandma sometimes still felt loss [wd2,1-]  .  Of cause [wd3,1-] , it was not the same as she felt many years ago.  When the whole family got together, apart from chitchat, my parents, my sister and I usually talked about the [wd5,2-1]  litterature [fm1,-] , current events and things we learned from TV, radio, newspaper [np6,-2]  and magazines.  But for most of the things we talked about, Grandma could not understand.[sn8,s]    In these cases, she always sat quietly, nothing to say.  I had thought that it was only indifference about what she could not understand.  However, Only [fm3,-]  when I went out for a walk with Grandma one day after supper, [sn9,-]  did I went [vp4,2-] into the depth of her heart.  When we were walking, she told me sentimentally that although the sky at twilight was beautiful, it meant the end of a day.  And then, I tried to understand her inner feeling [np6,2-] .  It was [np7,-2]  same kind of self-contradicsion [fm1,-]  -- she was so happy to see the children were no longer like her, uneducated on the other hand, she felt inferior and lonely.  From then on, we always tried [vp6,5-]  to keep her company. "Look! How beautiful the cloud looks! " Grandma's remark drew me back in time. I should cherish the chance to see the beauty of dusk with Grandma. "To tell the truth, when your sister get [vp6,3-3]  married, I felt a little loss [wd2,4-] .  But how fast the [wd5,2-2]  time flies!   Now I'll be a great-grandma! Today, I went to buy some clothes for my coming great-grandson, [sn1,s-s]  oh, I can bet, it must be a boy, people said [vp6,1-4]  I still look active and healthy for my age." [sn1,s] "Grandma, you'll be busy again.  I know you're always likeing [fm2,-] [vp6,4-]   to keep yourself busy." So, I'll never be lonely." I looked up into the sky and found that it was the most impressing moment.  Although it was continuing to go down, the sun had dyed the clouds rosy.  What a brilliant scene and what a beautiful sky at twilight!

I'm against the verdict that the boy was not guilty. First, I believe that what the old man said was true.  It's possible for him to hear the boy say  "I'm going to kill you"  though the train was roaring over and it's also possible for him to walk to the front door from his bed within 15 seconds.  Nowadays, scientists have proven that in some special situation [np6,2-] , we can show the potential of our physical ability and do something we can not do in usual time [pp2,2-] .  Suppose   the boy was about to kill his father, the words "I am going to kill you" should sound more hoarse and terroble [fm1,-] , different from the words "I'll kill you"  we said in our daily life.  If the old man did hear the words and then hear the sound of the falling of a body, think of it, it's not a wonder for the old man to get to the front door as quickly as possible   to see what had happened. Secondly, I am still not sure whether the woman weared [fm2,-]  her glasses or not when she was tossing and turning. It's true that people usually don't wear glasses to bed.  But that does not mean there is no exception.  One of my friends often goes to bed, forgetting to put off [vp2,3-2]  her glasses, and she often finds that the  [np7,13-2] next morning.  What's more, the woman's eyesight has not been examined, and in fact, we have no idea about her exact eyesight situation.  How can we draw the conclusion that she could not see the murderer even if she didn't wear her glasses. Finally, let's turn to the downward angle of the knife.  They said if the boy had ever used a switch knife, he would never stabbed downward.  But how can we know the boy was experienced with switch knives?  And even if the boy was, since the stabbing probably happen after a struggle, the knife was not necessarily used underhanded.  We can not exclude the possibility that the boy killed his father accidentally in the struggle.  In that case, the angle can be downward. So, all comes to this: the boy was guilty.

In those days, people decorated [vp6,19-]  the gate with the traditional color of red, especially the red lantern and the couplet with blessing words.  And you will see many kinds of colorful balloons and firecrackers everywhere.  In the United States, the spirit of Christmas arrives about a month before the holiday itself, December 25. ate in November, street lights and store windows are decorated with the traditional Christmas color [np6,-4]  of   red and green.  Snowmen, Santa Claus, shepherds, angels, and Nativity scenes appear in countless shop windows.  Fir tree [np6,1-2] , holly wreaths, and mistletoe are familiar sights.  Families decorate their homes, inside and out, with colored lights and evergreens.     In [pp1,-2]  [np7,-2]  Spring  Festival, most of the Chinese will go home from other places to have a family reunion.  The whole family will enjoy a big happy dinner which we call a reunion dinner.  It's the most important and happy [aj3,3-]  thing to all the Chinese, because we have a most deep [aj3,2-]  love to [pp1,1-2]  the relatives.  On Christmas, many American families go to church and enjoy a traditional Christmas dinner just like [np7,1-1]  Chinese, but I don't think it's [pr1,19-]  as important as to the Chinese.  And now more and more people going to church is only for fun.[sn,s].      Both in the Spring Festival and on Christmas, are children [wd1,10-]  the happiest because they can get a lot of gifts.  In American [wd3,1-] , children could receive toys from Santa Claus in their stockings and they exchange gifts with their parents under the Christmas tree.  In China, on the New Year's Day, the children should get up earlier than their parents and kowtow to them, then they can get their lucky money. [sn1,s] Now of course they needn't kowtow.  Besides they can also get money from their grandparents, aunts, [wd4,2-1]  uncles.  So in the new year the children are very rich.  They can buy everything they like.     Although the Spring Festival in China is different from the Christmas in US, they are of the same importance to people.  I like the days of [np7,-2]  Spring Festival, for I can relax to my heart's content.  Perhaps the Americans have the same feeling with me.

Do you think the art [wd3,-1]  course and the science course should be completely separated?  In fact, I don't think so.  The art [wd3,-1]  and the science are two different courses, but they connect [vp7,2-3]  to each other very much.  The art [wd3,-1]  trains people's understanding  skill, and the science trains people's logical skill.  However, the understanding and the logical skills are both very important in the art [wd3,2-4]  and the science.  In China, from senior [wd4,1-1]  school we separate [np7,2-4]  art [wd3,2-3]  from [np7,3-2]  science completely.  I think it's a serious problem.      How to study the art [wd3,4-]  and the science, here I have some opion [fm1,-]  of my own.  In studying the two different courses, there are resemblances and differences.  The resemblances are such as carefulness, memory, and observation. [sn8,s]   Carefulness is the most important in doing everything. With care, you can distinguish two similar things easily and can find something other people can't see.  So carefulness can improve your memory and observant skill.  Actually good studying methods are all good to the art [wd3,-3]  and the science. [sn8,s]   However, the art [wd3,1-3]  and the science lay particular stress on them [pr1,s-] .  For example the art [wd3, 1-]   needs more memory and the science requires more observation; the art [wd3,1-1]  students should have more understanding efforts [wd3,1-]  and the science students with more logical efforts [wd3,1-]  are better.  In studying art [wd3,2-] , you should have more patience because there are a lot of things for you to memorize and most of the things are very similar to each other.  You will confuse them easily unless you rememorize them frequently. In studying science, there are only some main formulas you should memorize.  Then you should learn to use them to deduct the others.  So if you have a good head for logic, that's very good. Studying is very flexible.  It's hard to say which method is the best.  Different people study in different ways.     The art [wd3,1-3]  and the science are of the same importance to our society.  I believe if we were good at both of them, the society would develope [fm1,-]  more quickly, I hope the day is not far away.

He had discovered the isochronism of pendulum and invented the compass, the thermometer and above all, the telescope.  All of these  benefited the whole world inestimably.  However, how about Galileo's character?  How can he did such things as other people couldn't do? [sn8,s]      The truth is always first grasped by a few people.  We call them scientist [np6,3-] .  The most important reason that they found out other people can't see is that they have intense interest and extraordinary observations [sn8,s]  Galileo was was just such a person.  He had entered the University  of Pisa to study medicine.  But his real interest was in mathematics and his experiments.  He dedicated his life to it despite a lot of difficulties.  And his discovery and inventions were surely oming [vp6,6-]  from his extraordinary observation in the ordinary life.    Besides, Galileo was used to challenge [vp5,4-]  and probe [vp5,6-]  the mystery of things.  He never took anything for granted.  In  his days, everyone in his hometown believed Aristotle's theories very much except Galileo.  He could not accept as authoritative the answers which the adults about him offered in response to his questions.  After his own examination, he challenged the theory of Aristotle in spite of he sneers of his students and the wrath of his professors.  His daring to do so obviously reflected his great courage and self-confidence.  There is none other than him.    In fact, in order to pursue the scientific truth he suffered a lot .  All the people in his hometown laughed at him, hated him, even then [wd5,10-2]   persecuted him because he didn't stop his "non sense" .  Finally he had to leave his hometown for Padua, where the pursuit of scientific studies would not be interfered by the Inquisition.  Although he got great success and became famous there, he was not happy.  Then he came back and there came his great tragedy.  In spite of the cruel persecution, he still persisted in the truth until he died.   Galileo was a great scientist.  For the truth he devoted all his time and even his valuable life, but his spirit would last for ever.

They love me and I love them.  But I never thought it over or had deep feeling [np6,2-2]  about it. It's after I left home for study that I really felt the great love between my parents and me.    My father is the main supporter of our family.  His work made him often been away from home.[sn,s].   Every time he came back only for a few day's rest.[sn,s].   So in my childish heart Father was very far away from me.  In fact, I was a little afraid of him.  However, an unforgettable thing make [vp6,11-]  everything changed.[sn,s].   When I was 13 years ago [sn8,s] , I lived in school for study.  Once, after class I went back to the domitory [fm1,-] .  Suddenly I saw my bed and desk had been made tidy. All my dirty clothes had gone and the bed  cover and sheet had been changed into clear [wd3,9-1]  ones.  My first feeling told me that Mom came here.[sn,s].   However, when I rushed into the washingroom [fm2,-]  excitedly, to my great surprise, I saw Father was washing things for me.  It was the first time Father showed his love to me directly because I seldom saw him doing such things.  At that moment, I was deeply  moved and really wanted to say, "Father, I love you, too."  From then on, the barrier between Father and me disappeared immediately.      In my memory, Mother is the strongest and the most labourous [fm1,-]  person in the world.  In my childhood, Father was seldom at home. Besides working outside, Mother did all the houseworkings [fm1,-]  and looked after my sister and me.  Although she was very strict with us, we always knew she loved us and we loved her. When I went out to study, I saw [vp1,-4]  many classmates'  mothers cried. However, although my mom was also sad to see me away, she never cried, because she knew it was good to [pp1,3-1] me.  She taught me to put emotion inside and to learn to be strong.  As for me, my parents are the best in the world, and I love them the most all  my life.

More and more companies and individuals use this [pr3,13-6]  machine [np3,1-] . I think the use of computers will bring us into a new would. First, the computer can save our time and labore [fm1,-]. With its help we don't need to do the boring hard work. Furthermore, people can design and invent some new useful things by using it. So it will speed the proceedings of a company. And it is very convenient for the public. For example, the police can store all the things about criminals into the computer. At any time policemen can check out [vp2,1-1]  the information they want to know. It only takes a few minutes. Without it, how troublesome the work would be! The computer do  [vp3,1-]  us a world of good. More and more people realize it's souseful [fm1,-] and convenient [wd2,s-]. There [wd7,-s] it's used widely. I think the use of computers does good to human being. The computer helps people to do many jobs. Without [wd4,-1]  computer's help, people can't produce so many things. Since there is  [wd4,-1] computer, people needn't do some complicate [wd2,-1]  work. The computer can do it itself. Such as [cj2,-s]  in [wd4,-1]  company, people need [vp9,-1]  record many thing [np3,1-]  about what is done everyday. but [fm3,-][wd3,-s] the use of computer now help them do such things. Using a computer you can look through and know the company's condition in short time. With computers' help, the company need [vp3,1-]  a few people instead of many people. A computer can do what people do. Using a computer, you can so your job more correctly. [, -1]   [fm3,-]  Such as the data of your company. [fm3,-] if the people record the data they must make some mistakes, but if you [pr1,7-]  use a computer, it will make less mistake [np3,1-] . So I think the use of computers is good to us. Using a computer, you can do your job fast, correct [ad2,4-]  and if you have a company, you needn't pay so much money to employ so many people. As we all know, the use of computer [np3,2-]  is getting more and more popullar [fm1,-] in the resent years. Many people began to learn and use computers in order to make their work, study and daily life become more convinient [fm1,-], easier and happier. So, the use of computer [np3,2-]  can really help people. In many companies and factories, the computer [np3,-5]  is [vp3,1-]  very important. With their help, people can do many jobs without move [vp5,1-]  away from the desk, they just sit at the desk, look at the screen and push some buttons, all the works will be done, all the information will be recalled by computers. With the use of computer [np3,2-] , hard labour [cc4,-1]  work will be no longer difficult to people, and matal [fm1,-]  work such as counting, measure [vp4,1-1] , searching for files, saving information can be easily done. With the use of computer [np3,2-] , daily life will be no longer boring and uninteresting. You can use the computer to wake you up, and if you feel dull, there are some games saved in the computer, you can play with it. So now you can see, the use of computer [np3,2-]  brings a new way of life to people, and it is going to change our future! Nowadays, computers have come to many fields They help a lot. At homes, They can help with kinds of housework, Correct [fm3,-] [vp4,5-5]   the homework of children's [np4,2-] , do [vp4,5-]some shopping, and also you can stay at home and capture the news of stocks from the computer. At factories, they [pr1,3-]  can help with many things that people can't do. Computer [np3,-1]  are useful moden [fm1,-] machine [np3,3-]  that link with the future of people. Computers are so useful because of their instructure [fm1,-] . It's a long way that scientists invent computers. They sent the information into the computers so that computers can so things by orders. The computers are made of special meterial [np3,5-]  so that they can deal with the work which is dangerous without being hurt. They can do many things freely because of he intelligen [fm1,-]  that were fixed upon. As we all know that computers are very useful. With their help, people can do things  a convenion [fm1,-]  and quick way. Wherever at homes, the [np7,1-]  fatories [fm1,-]or other fields, they work very well. fm3,-] computers become more and more important this pr3,-1]  days. [np7,-1]  [fm3,-] Computer is no long strange or us, following the development of science. Some families own their computers now. It shows that  [np7, -1] computer is useful and convient [fm1,-]  for people to deal with heir jobs and studies. Most of the big companies and factories use computers. They can o their business with it [pr1,7-] . Not only some hospitals but lso some libraries use it [pr1,10-] , too [wd5,5-] . The computer can help them to calculate and store the information. With the help of computers, people can save more time and labor nd are able to do other things well. In some universities and schools, students have a chance to learn how to use the computers. And they all enjoy it [pr1,5-] . I am sure that computers will be more  common and useful for us in the future. It can help us in many fields. And it must make our country more advanced and stronger. In recent years, computers are used in more and more fields. It's convinient [fm1,-]  and quick to use a computer. And it also save [vp3,1-]  time and labour when  using a computer. A computer, as it is called, is a machine  that [wd5,-2]  use [wd5,-1]  to store datas [np5,1-]  or numbers and [wd5,-2]  use [wd5, 1-]  to caculate [fm1,-] complecated [fm1,-]  numbers. When somebody need to know something about [wd5,1-]  that [wd5,2-]  he is not so sure or he can not find it [wd5,12-] in the books, a computer can help him. So long as he press [vp3, 1-]  the right button then [wd5,6-]  the data he want [vp3,1-]  to know will appeare [fm1,-] in its [pr1,10-]  cream. A computer can also be used to play games, such as football, basketball and chess. A computer can also help people  in charge of a company or a factory.[vp1,s] The managers use computers instead of some people who have [vp9,1-1] go from one ace [wd7,3-]  another to pass the message that their owners want to know before the computers are invented .Now that the managers can use the computers to pass message [np3,-2] which have been stored in the computer a few seconds before. The se of computer are [vp3,3-]  in many ways. Computers have become a vital part in modern life. As the science are [vp3,1-]  developed, the computers will be ore and more useful and scientific. Nowaday [fm1,-]  computers are used more widely [wd5,1-3] and more widely. [wd5,-1]  such as in the library, in the office, in the library, [wd5,5-]  in the factory and so on. Because computers have many uses: accounting. entering materials, typing, drawing. Computers do people good. Computer [np3,4-]  makes easy  [vp1,2-1]  do the job [np3,10-] . For example, if computer [np3,-1]  are used in a library, they an store [wd7, -1]  how many and what books in the library. It can make fewer mistake [np3,1-]  and also subtract the number of the workers. So computers can save labour and people [np3,3-] . It's very important for people [,7-1] . Accounting is one of the most uses of computers. Computers can help people account complecated [fm1,-]  number [np3,1-]  and make few mistake [np3,1-] . So it [pr1,12-]  can save time and labour. And then [wd5,-s]  computers can draw pictures. Now many archetecters [fm1,-]  use computer [np3,2-]  to drow [fm1,-]  buildings. Computers have other uses. Computers have a lot of uses.It is very useful for people. In the future, computers are [vp6,2-]  used in every field. With the development of technology, the use of computers is very common, and it brings people convenience and more knowledges [np5,1-]. Many students use computers in their studies. The computers are easy to operate, you [pr1,4-]  can be easy to install the information and get the result in some seconds because of its high speed. The computers can also keep stores [wd7,1-] . When you want some information, you are able to get it from the computers in no time. At the same time, the computers can teach you more knowledges [np5,1-]. If you can't understand the meaning of a word, and you think it's trouble to look up a dictionary, you can consult the computer. It's really very convenient. In our school dinning-room, we use computer [np3,2-] , too. When you get the food, you should put you [pr4, 3-]  card [np3,-3]  into the computers. At the end of the month, the computer [np3,7-]  will count you [pr4,14-]  bill [np3,14-] . Nowadays, more and more people use computers. That's to say computers are widely used in many ways such as shops, factories and so on. The use of computers makes people's lives more convenient and interesting. In our morden [fm1,-] society, [np7,-2]  computer becomes more and more important. It has been used wildly in many fields Our daily lives also are connected with computer [np3,15-] . Computer [np3,-4]  has [vp3,1-]  different kinds. Some are very huge, they are often used in science. They can control roborts [fm1,-] and machines instead of human. Some are used in family [np3,4-] . Now more and more family [np3,1-]  have PC (personal computer [np3,4-] ). People can watch VCD and play games throught [fm1,-]the computer. We can also store important information and data into it. We can join the internet. It is a information highway. Then without going out, we can get all kinds of information from all over the world and make friends. [np7,-3]   [fm3,-] Personal computer is a special window, through it you can get to know the world. People can use it [pr1,13-]  to write. Compared with writing by hand, using the [np7,-1]  computer to write is more easy [aj3,1-1] , quickly  [ad3,1-]  and [wd4,2-1]  convince [fm1,-] . The use of computers makes our social lives [np1,1-]  become faster and faster. Computer [np3,9-]  will act [vp2,-3]  n important role in future. Nowadays the use of computers has spread over the globe. Many people are familiar with them. In fact, the computers really help the human a lot. In some modern factories, you can see the roborts[fm1,-] controller [vp2,3-1]  by the [np7,-1]  computers, work [vp4,1-1]  without a stop. If people let the computers know what to do, they can do [vp1,5-1]  very well. Working in such  [np7,1-1] way not only save [vp3,6-] time but also save [vp3,3-]  labours. After visiting factories sn7,-1] , let's go back home. There, you can know more about the use of computers. As soon as you enter the [np7,-1]  house, you can see many kinds of auto-machines, such as auto-washing machine, auto-air conditioner, auto-cooker and so on. They are all controlled by computers, too. As long as you turn on the witch, everything is ok. You don't need to worry about the washing, cooking and other housework. Also in scientific research, scientists use the computers to do come dangerous work. For an [np7,1-1]  instance, the computers can be ordered to control the time of nuclear weapon's explosion, of course, the scientists are safe, staying in the hiding shelter to watch. All n all, the computers do good to human [np6,1-] . They can help n many respects [fm1,-] . They are good helpers. Nowadays in the big city of Guangzhou, you will meet many, many computer shops when you go out. [np7,-1]  Computer is used in a lot of ways in lots of fields. Nearly all the students in colleges more or less [ad1,3-]  have to learn how to use computers. Some of my roommates say they are illiterate now because they know nothing about computer [np6,14-] . You can see , how important the computer is now.  [np7,3-]  [fm3,-] Computer is widely used in o many fields because of its good abilities. It   can do many things, such as caculation [fm1,-], control [wd7,1-]  and so on. It can work much faster than man's [wd3, 1-]  brains. It can operate very correct [wd2,1-] . It can also work out some difficult problems. With the computer,  [np7, 1-] man can carryout a project much faster, do many things easily without hard labourwork [wd3,1-] .[np7,16-]  [fm3,-] Computer is of great use. We have to study it and learn how to operate [vp1,1-] , or we can not make good use of ourselves [sn7,10-] .With the develop [wd2,2-]  of science and technology ,our society has been more morden [fm1,-]and morden [wd5,2-] . One of the greatest achievement [np6,4-]  is the appearance  f [np7,-1]  computer. With  [np7,-1] computer we can do our work conveniently. [np7,-1] Computer [np6,-3]  not only help us save our time, but also help us do work better and better. Computers are very useful to human being. Computer [np6,7-]  has [vp3,1-]  appeared in most of work field. In factories, they help the workers control the machine;  in school, students can use them to do their homework or play interesting games. This can help the students' brains develop. In some companies, the clerks use computers to store their massage [np6,1-]  of their cooperations [fm1,-]. This can help the companies know each other further. But [cj1, -1]  on the other hand, some people use computer to do something wrong. In a word, we should use computers properly and make it pr1,4-]  bring more conviences [fm1,-]  and benefits [fm1,-] to human being. Computers become more and more important in [pp1,-1]  nowadays. They are the carriers of knowledge. In computers you an find all kinds of referrences [np5,2-] in many subjects that you need. Computers also [ad1,-1]  are the tools that we can communicate with each other. In our modern society computers play an important role. If we are interested in some subjects we can enjoy oursleves [fm1,-] by[wd3,-] computer. We progress with the help of computers. They can give you [pr1,9- 5]  many useful information.We can find all kinds of information through internet. We can make friends and communicate with others without going out of your [pr1,12-]  homes. We can enjoy many entertainment programmes [fm1,-] by computers. On [wd3,-1]  businesses [np5,1-]  we can contact with others in such a short time that we can work more effectially [fm1,-]. So the usage of computers become [vp3,3-]  wider. We need computers wherever [sn8,-] . Computers can make our lives more convienient [fm1,-]  and interesting. Computers are very useful to our human beings. they've done wonders for us since the first computer was born. but it's important to use them properly. Computers can do many things for people as they are required to. For example, nowadays lots of them [pr1,2-1]  work in factories. The engineers in still [sn8,3-]procedure requirment [fm1,-] to the computers and put them into roberts [fm1,-], and then, the roberts [fm1,-] will do the work properly. They won't feel tried [fm1,-]  or complain about the work. Many scientific researches np5,2-]  need accurate numbers and most of them are very complicated. sing [np5,-1] computer, the scientists can get the result in several seconds while it'll need [np7,-1]  man's almost entire life long [wd5,1-]  to do [wd4,1-]  .Though computers are of  [wd4,1-1]  use , people are aware of their problems. They are easily infected [vp1,1-1]  computer virus. And some of criminals use them to commit crimes. It is said that some very clever criminals use computer [np6, 1-1]  to get the [np7,0-1]  money from banks. So, computers are really wonderful and dangerous. They do goods [fm2,-]  to the [np7,0- 1]  people but some times [fm1,-]  they are used to do harm to us. We should carefully [ad1,0-2]  use them. Nowadays computers show their value in more and more fields and become a new pet [np3, 2-0]  [np3,13-0]  of people. Computers can be used in many ways and at [pp1,0-2]  many laces, such as factories, schools, cinemas, super markets and families. Computers are very powerful. When you enter a modernized factory, you can notice there are not so many workers, because computer  [np6,1-]  can replace so many people. The factory just need [vp3,2-0]  some people to sit in the control-room and control the computers, then the products will be produced continually. And in our school's dining-room, you needn't pay money or [np7,0-2]  old-style meal-cards [np1,5-0] , you just put [cc3,0-6]  a special card in the computer, then you can pay your money indirectly. Computers can make your life not so troublesome. [sn1,s] And also, they can bring you more joy. With the help of computers, you can singsongs with the music that you choose conveniently in your home, you can make your washing-machine wash up all of your cloths, and you [vp9,1-2]  also play TV Games in your room. Computers just   [ad1,1-1]  are a kind of interesting and powerful thing. It can make your life become more and more attractive. My View on Cigarette Smoking When you walk in the street you'll find many people are doing the some [fm1,-]  thing: smoking. Not only in public place [fm2,-] , [wd5,-]  in the street, or [wd5,-]  shops [sn9,-]  restaurants, post offices ect[fm1,-], but  also at home, man or woman, young or old seem to enjoy smoking. In my opinion, there is nothing more hateful than cigarette smoking. Why I hate cigarette smoking? Because I think smoking either wastes money or pulluts [fm1,-] the environment. Most important of all, it will do harm  to people's health. The smoking people will have such experience: Once you begin smoking, you'll [vp9,5-5]  never give it up easily. Many people have been a smoker [np3,5-0]  for several years, or even longer. Sometimes, they don't stop smoking until they die. So they must [vp9,0-5]  spend much money from [vp2,3-1]  smoking. On the contrary, [cj1,6-7]  smoking just does harm to people's [fm1,-]  health. According to the scientist's research, there are a lot of piosonous [fm1,-] substances in the cigarette. Among these substance [np3,1-0] , Nicotin[fm1,-] is the most poisonous thing. A [np7,0-1]  experiment proved that just a drop of Nicotin [fm1,-] will kill three strong horses. Just imagine  how many [np8,1-1]  Nicotin  [fm1,-] there is in the cigarette and how many Piosonous [fm1,-] substances the smoker breath [fm1,-]  into their lungs when they smoke! Scientists believe that smoking will cause lung cancer. They find people who smoke will have much more chances to gave [fm1,-]  lung cancer than those who don't smoke. In a word, cigarette smoking is the most hateful thing in the world. It either waste your money or does harm to your health. I hope there is no any one who smokes in this world, I don't like smoking very much, to be exact, I hate smoking. Smoking will do harm to the [np7,0-1]  people. It will cause all kinds f disease [np3,3-0] , the [np7,0-1]  cancer is most typical [aj3,1-] , which will lead to the death of people at last. In spite of it , it can also pollute air and do bad to the other people except for [wd5,-]  the smoker. It [pr2,0-4]  is no doubt, every smoker knows the damages that smoking will do, because there is [vp3,0-4]  "stop smoking" mark everywhere in public place [np3,3-0] . But to my surprise, they don't stop smoking  in spite of the other's health. Please stop smoking! My View on Studying abroad Generally speaking, students who study abroad, especially in good universities, Oxford, for example, can learn quite a lot [wd4,-]  new and advanced things there. But I think that studying abroad is not so easy and it needs the students' courage and determination to overcome all the difficulties. I believe that studying abroad is the dream of any [fm1,-]  Chinese students. We have deep impression about Oxford, Cambridge, Havard [fm1,-], and so on. Overseas students can go into some advanced [fm1,-]  fields which are not begun [vp6,2-0]  in our own country. So if they can learn well and make achievement [fm2,-]  in their own field [np3,2-0] , they can do great[cc4,-1] good to our motherland when they come back. By sending students abroad, Japan had achieved quick development after Mingzhi Reform. I think [fm1,-]  it is sensible to learn from Japan. On the other hand, overseas students find difficulties to [vp2,2-1]adjust [vp5,3-0]themselves to the different circumstance. They need to be diligent and try to learn more. And perhaps they'll lack of [vp2,1-1]  money and have to do part-time job [np3,9-0] . In short, studying abroad is great but it needs to be carefully handle [vp7,2-0] . Studying abroad is not so good, in my opinion. Thought [fm1,-]  I know many people want [vp4,0-1]  staying abroad, so many people try every thing [fm1,-]  to go abroad. Abroad, [sn2,s]means that you're not [fm1,-]  in your motherland, you are just a guest. Of cause [fm1,-] , the living [fm1,-]  conditions in many other countries are quite good, but most of the Chinese people abroad was [vp6,10- 2]  not accepted by the foreigners. The whites always think that they are superior to Asian, especially Chinese [np7,1-]. So many many [wd5,1-0]  unfair things happen [vp6,1-3]  to the Chinese abroad. The persons who can apply to go out, [wd4,s-]always the learned, or skillful, or having ability [cc4,1-1]people, if let them staying abroad, [sn8,s]it's a loss of our country. So staying abroad is not as good as many people dream. Among the foreigners, you may be [fm1,-]  treated rude [ad2,1-0], unfair [ad2,2-0] , or another even worse things.[sn8,s] Our society is a competitive one, People [fm3,-]  compete for everything in order to lead a better life. Late in the 20th century, only the people who are well educated can win the competition. So, many people would like to study abroad to get a higher level education and some useful experience as long as they can afford t [fm1,-] . In my opinion, studying abroad is quite good for some people. If you are good at English, you can manage your life when studying abroad. You can receive better education in America or in England. In the school, you can learn something advanced that are quite helpful to our country. In the meantime, you can improve your oral English. If you are major in English, that's the best way. When you come back, after several years of hard work, you probably can get a high position and lead a better life. But if you are not good at English, I think you'd better not studying [vp5,3-0]  abroad, because if you can't communicate with the people outside, how can you learn something good from them? All in all, you should think about studying abroad according to your own condition. It is only good for some people. If I have enough many [fm1,-]  and I really do very well in my studies, I'd like to study abroad when I graduate in three years. I think studying abroad is quite good and attractive. When you study broad, you must often contact with the native people, then you can learn about their customs and traditions by yourself And you an [fm1, -]  learn more knowledges[np5,1-] you can't learn from the books. If you study in your own country, what you learn is quite limited, When you study abroad, you must communicate with others,so you have to learn the native language and speak it well. In that case, you can learn another language quite well. I major in English, if I study abroad, I think I can improve my English quickly because I have to communicate with the English speakers and speak English more often. I think studying abroad will do good to you. You can learn more knowledges [np5,1-] including a second language. Now, more and more people are studying abroad. Though the education [wd4,2-3]  of other countries is different from the education [wd4,2-2]  of China, and there are many difficulties the students who study abroad should face, the students have a lot of useful things to learn. I have a friend who is studying in Canada. He told me at the beginning he [fm1,-]  study[sn8,s-], he had to get used to the life in Canada. Language is the one of the most [wd4,1-3]  of the problem [np3,6-0] . Though he had learned English in China, after he came to Canada studying [vp5,3-0] , he found that he couldn't understand the foreigners' saying even a word. It is [vp6,1-]  hard to communicate with each other. But after a few months, he can [vp6,s-]  speak English fluently and know [vp6,s-]  what people say [vp6,s-] . Then he can [vp6,s-]  study without the problem of language. He told me he had studied many subjects. The universities in other countries are well equiped [fm1,-]. He can get a lot of useful knowledge from that. He said studying abroad could give [wd4,-1]  experience which we can not get in China. Studying abroad maybe would let you ace  [fm1,-]  a lot of difficulties, but it also let you learn a lot. My View on Studying Abroad From the middle of 1980's, more and more young people or mid-aged [fm1,-]  people prefer studying abroad to studying [fm1,-]  in their own countries [fm2,-] ,because they think it's a good way to improve their study. But I don't think so. Of course, in other countries, there are many international universities, such as Harvard University and Oxford University, they are well equipped. They have many famous professors and good condition for study. They also offer grants, aids and loans. But, as we know, the tuition of the private universities is quite expensive. Many students have to do past-time job [np3,6-]  to pay for it. When the students are free from class, they have to work on campus or off campus. That means they have no free time all the[wd5,1-1] day. What a hard life they live! The worst thing about the students or cholars [fm1,-]  studying abroad is that when they graduate, they don't want to go back to our countries [fm2,-] . They just stay at [pp1,1-2]  the ountries which offer them high income and work for them. It's unfair. Our motherland spent so much on their study, but they make achievement [np3,2-3]  for other countries. When someone have [vp3,1-]  the ability to study abroad, they [pr3,7-]  can do it. But they must remember that they are members of Chinese, they must serve China when they complete their study. I hope that one day I can have the opportunity to study abroad. In [wd5,-1]  nowadays, studying abroad can do good [fm1,-]  to one person or his country. Studying abroad may open your own eyes. [wd4,3-]  You can learn a lot of things that you can't do in your own country. Such as the customs of the foreign country, the civilizations, the education, the medication [fm2,-] system, and so on. All these can make your spirits rich. And if you are patriotic, you can study the advantage part [wd5,1- 2]  of civilization of the abroad.[sn8,s] If it can be developed in your own country, you can return [fm1,-]  your homeland and work hard to realize it. There are many examples [fm1,-]  in our[wd5,-1] China, such as Mr Qian xuesheng, Mr Hua Luogeng, etc. So, if you have the chance to study abroad, go ahead without hesitation. There are more and more students that studying abroad nowadays. On the one hand, it is good. So that our nature will get stronger by speed.[sn8,s] On the other hand, a few students have been attracted by other developed countries and have become the citizens of other countries. And, it's a hard lifeship [fm1,-]  to live abroad. The students studying abroad can learned [vp5,1-]  much advance [vp5,-1]  skill [np3,s-]  from other countries and bring the good thing [np9,s-] back to contribute for [vp2,1-2]  our nature [wd3,-s] , so that our country gets stronger and stronger. But our country is not much [wd4,-s]  rich [aj3,0-1]  than the developed countries. Some students didn't want to be back and [sn6,5-4]  work for other countries. It's also a lost [fm2,-]  of our nature [fm1,-] . Then, it's hard to live without help, when you leave you [fm1,-] country [fm1,-] . In order to earned [vp5,3- 0]  money, you have to do part-time jobs. So, in my opinion, study [vp5,-s]  abroad is a thing with advantage and disadvantage. It depends. If you want to do something of use for our county [fm1,-] . Just [fm3,-] study hard, and come back to our country and work for it. That's a good way. Nowaday [fm1,-]  [fm1,-], more and more students [fm1,-]  and the men who are working go abroad to study. I think it is very good for everyone. First, studying abroad can improve your own knowledge. One man's knowledge is limited. If you go abroad to study, you can learn many aspect [np3,1-0]  of knowledge such as custom, politics, people's life, culture, and so on. In school, you have [vp6,1-s]a chance to study your professional subject with the director's help. So you'll get a lot of knowledge. Secondly, studying abroad can make you [wd5,- 2]  good character. There is a new envionement[fm1,-] in abroad[wd2,1-]. You have to make yourself to [wd5,2-1]  adapt this environment. Maybe you have to endure alone pain and hard life. I have heard that many students at abroad[wd2,1-] have to make a living for [wd3,3-2]washing wishes [fm1,-] or doing other jobs. That's not as[wd3, s-]  many people imagine. But it can make you endurce [fm1,-]good character. At last, you also make friends with foreigners. It's very important that you get on well with others. You can learn something about relation. Studying abroad is very wonderful. If I had a chance, I would go abroad to study. Nowadays, many rich parents sent [vp6,s-]  their children to abroad[wd2,1-] to study. I think this is a good idea. Because studying abroad is better than studying in our own country. First, you can know the customs of the foreign country. There are many difference [np3,1-]  between our customs and [np7,3-1] foreigner's. So if you study in abroad[wd2,1-], you can know the customs and cultures of the foreigners. Second, you can improve your oral English very soon. In China, you have little chance to speak English. But in [np7,-2]  foreign country, you have to speak English every [wd3,0-1]  time. You will get great improvement in your oral English. I think studying abroad is better than studying in our own city. Although it costs a lot of money. You not only can know the customs and cultures of the foreign country, but also can improve your oral English. In recent years, many people want to go abroad, and studying is a good reason. So many people apply for it. I think studying abroad is good for a [np7,-1]  people to go to foreign countries, learn from them, and when he come [vp3,1-0]  back, he could use this knowledge to serve[vp1,-1] for our country. China is a developing country. In many respects, we couldn't match the developed countries, such as U. S, English [wd3,0-] , French [wd3,0-] , etc. and the experience, science, and knowledge of these countries are much richer than ours. So, it is very necessary for us to learn from them, then we could improve our country more and more quickly. In order to get to this point, we must go abroad and study there.If we want to match the developed countries, we also have to know about them, we have to know their history, their society, their development, and so on. If we just stay at home and read all the books about them, that is not enough, [sn9,-]  we must join their society and study [wd3,-s]  from the people and their traditions, it will help us to know the country, so we sent [vp6,s-]  people to study abroad. So studying abroad is a good way[np2,-1] for developing [vp5,1-]  our country, but the people get the chance must remember: Here is our motherland and it is our root! In my opinion, study [vp5,-s]  abroad may do good to people [fm1,-] ,their country, but it is hard to keep on it. [sn8,s]Studying in foreign country, people can learn some knowledge which they can not [fm1,-]learn in his own country, such as the culture, the costoms  [fm1,-], the communication of that country. Also, people can make their will become stronger and stronger in spite of the foreigner's [np4,s-]  despiration [fm1,-] . They can prove that his  [pr3,4-]  own country is the best and the most beautiful country in the world. For [wd3,-s]  they work very hard, do their best to master the modern scientific cultural knowledge[cc3,2-], they can make their own country become [wd5,-]stronger and stronger as a reward [wd3,2-]when they come back. But sometimes study [vp5,-s]  abroad is not an easy thing. All of us know the uition [fm1,-]  of study broad [fm1,-]  is quite high in many developed countries. he [fm1,-]  students have to take a [wd3,0-2]  or many part-time jobs to support it. The life is hard abroad. It's a pity that some people can't overcome the difficulties and have to come back home without getting a degreed [fm1,-] . I think study [vp5,-s]  abroad is quite good, it can help ourselves to know the world thoroughly. [wd4,s-]  any [fm1,-]  people want to study [fm1,-]  abroad. They think that they can learn more knowledge about other [fm1,-]  countries. I absolutely agree with them. But I don't want to do as they like. [sn8,s]It is not easy for everyone to study abroad. [sn9,-]  Because [fm3,-]  the persons who study abroad don't adapt [vp1, 2-]  the food, the limate [fm1,-]  the costume[wd3,s-]  and so on there. And the tuition is high. So most students must do the part-time jobs in their spare time. It is reported that the local students and the students who come from other countries have no equal chance to get jobs in the United States. It usually takes 2 or 3 years to study abroad. If e [fm1,-]  must spend most of time adapting and working, then the time that we can [wd5,4-1]  study is [vp6,s-]  so little. I believe that we also can learn more knowledge on other countries here. And we don't have to waste [fm1,-]  the valuable time to adapt and work, so we can save more time [fm1,-]  to study well. In that case, I prefer study [vp5,1-2]  here to study [vp5,4-0]  abroad. In my opinion, studying abroad is the best experience for us, especially for the students who major in foreign languages. As we know, to master a foreign language is not easy for the Chinese people. Because we don't have so many [np3,1-1]  environment or situations for us to speak it. As a result, we just memorize some useful phrases but we do not know how and when and to what person we use them. the worst part's that we can't know well about the foreign country's customs and cultural background [sn9,-]  even though [fm1,-]  we can read some references, but in fact it's not enough. These is [vp3,1- 3]  the usual problems in our language study. Studying abroad can help us to solve all the problems. We can go abroad o widen our horizon and learn a lot of knowledge. Studying abroad can give us a good language situation, we can speak as often as possible in our daily life. On the other hand, we can increase a lot of customs and background knowledge when we communicate with the foreigners. At last, studying abroad can make us more independent, because we must do everything by ourself [fm1,-]. All of these is just what we can't experience in our own country.   In a word, studying abroad can increase our knowledge, make ourself [fm1,-] more independent. It really not nly [fm1,-]  do good to our study, but also  [wd4,1-0] our character's training. I wish I could study abroad in the future. Studying abroad sounds great. But it doesn't means [fm2,-]  you will be very Sucessful  [fm1,-] after your studying. So I don't completely agree to [vp2,1-1]  studying abroad. When you are studying abroad. you will meet a lot of difficulties. Such as economics [wd3, s-] , language, how to adjust the new enviroment[fm1,-]. It is said that the students studying abroad make [wd3,-3]  a hard life there. They have to work outside while they are studying. So I think it will have a bad effect on their studies. What's more, some students even do crime things [vp2, 2-]  for their living.because they can't resist the money. But on the other hand, we can learn a lot of advanced knowledge of the developed countries from studying abroad and use them to serve our country. If you have confidence in yourself and courage of facing the [wd5,-5]  all kinds of the [np7,3-1]  difficulties, studying abroad is a good opportunity  [fm1,-] for you. But if not, I suggest you should study in your own country.   Studying abroad is becoming more[aj3,-3] popular and popular now. Will it benefit to [vp1,-1]  the development to [pp1,2-2]  our country? It is the most important thing the [wd5,-1] people concern. Of course, studying abroad, especially in the developed country, can [wd5,-s]  learn a lot of advanced knowledge and tenology  [fm1,-] to enrich ourselves, [sn7,s]if the students would come back to his or her country after he or she finish studying. Our country is the developing country, we have to learn a lot from the developed ones to accelebrate [fm1,-]the rocedure [fm1,-]to realize the four modernization. So our government sent a lot students abroad to study. The students who came back have [fm1,-]contributed to our country greatly. The students stayed abroad attracted by the western country, which should be condened[fm1,-] by our people, because it isn't easy for them to be brought up. Only the patrotic  [fm1,-]studying abroad will do good to our country.   My View on Studying Abroad[sn9,-] I think studying abroad is good thing to [wd3,-] our Chinese students. Although there is something not so good, after all, its good points are more than its bad points. We can't deny that many aspects of other west[wd2,-1] countries education are better china's[sn8,s-].[sn9,-]Such as the condition of school,  [sn9,-] in other countries' school [np3,1-], the campus is so beautiful, there are TV sets in the classrooms and there are so many rooms supplied to students to live [sn9,-]  which in[fm1,-] different from our university. We must share a room with six or eight person [np3,1-] . It's not so good. There is not enough space for a student. Studying abroad is one way to accept good points of other countries. We also can't deny that in some aspects our country is backward. Going to other country [np6,1-] to study, we can absorb the good things of other country [np6,1-]. When we accept these good points, we come back to our country and let our people learn these good things or use it [pr3,3-] .By using [wd4,-4]  other countries' good points, we can improve our country's economic condition or other aspects. Studying abroad do [vp3,2-]  good to us and to our country. So I think it's a good things [np3,2-] . My View on Cigarette Smoking Cigarette smoking is known to be harmful to people all over the world I was [vp6,s-]  a strong cigarette objector, I think cigarette smoking is [vp6, s-2]  absulutely  [fm1,-] do harm to not only the smoker [np3, -1]  themselves     [fm1,-], but also the enviroment   [fm1,-] and people arround     [fm1,-] them. It's really a very bad habby   [fm1,-], the smokers should be scolded by all the sociaty [fm1,-]. Even the children know that the cigarette smoking[cc1,2-] is a wrong thing for them to do. If them [pr4,0-s]  smoke, they will certainly be scolded or punished.  As we all know, there are many poisonous metirals [fm1,-] in cigarette, [sn9,-]  the more cigarettes they smoke, the more poison they keep in their bodies, [sn9,-] sooner or later, they will be poisoned. Many cigarette smoker [np3,2-]  got killed or died for [wd3,s-]  canser [fm1,-] and many other disease [np3,2-0] . Not only the smokers themselves were [vp6,s-]  harmed, but also the second-hand smokers. Although they don't smoke, just because they stay near the smokers, they also get armed. Many children have a weak nose [np3,5-]  and throat, [np3,6-]  only because their parents, neighbours or relatives smoke. They are so young and have along [fm1,-]  time in the future, no one has the quality [wd3,s-]  to bring them into the suffering desease [fm1,-]! In order [fm1,-]  to clean up the future world for our [pr4,1-]  In my opinion, cigarette smoking can do harm to the people, including smokers and other people round them. Further more, it can affact     [fm1,-] social development. There are many advertises [wd4,0-]  n [fm1,-]  TV, n newspaper, and magerzines[fm1,-],in order to pursuade   [fm1,-] more and more people to smoke. The cigarette companies spend much [fm1,-]  money to put advertisements. Also more and more people smoke heavily. Though smoking can give smokers relaxation, it can cause lungcancer      [fm1,-] and other diseases. So smokers had [vp6,s-]  to see doctor [fm2,-]  more often than the non-smokers. Every year, many people die of lung cancer. If a smoker smokes in public, the harm may have an effort [wd3,2-1]  on the others who don't smoke. They breathe in the smoke, [sn9,-] step by step, the more smoke they breathe, the more chance they have to come down with cancer. [sn8,s]Because so much money has been spent on cigarette, less money will be used to social development. And throwing cigarette's [np4,0-1]  heads everywhere can affect environment. All in all, cigarette smoking not only wastes money, but also do [vp3,s-]  no-good to people's health. Now, the problem of cigarette smoking become [vp3,1-0]  more and more serious in society. Not only men smoke but also women join the range of smoker [np3,2-0]. Even some children become interested in it. Some smoker [np3,1-1]say smoking is a kind of relaxation. Some say it is a fashionable thing. [sn9,-] The other [wd4,s-]say they can protect themselves in the smoking. No matter what the smokers' opinions are, smoking is a dangerous thing. It should be got rid of in the hole [fm1,-]world. Cigarette smoking will do harm to people's health. Some people don't smoke. [sn9,-]But if their parents, wifes  [fm1,-], husbands, friends, or others who smoke in front of them. [sn9, s-]They will be forced to smoke. It can cause people [wd4,2-] unhealthy even to die. Cigarette smoking will pollute the air and do harm to the enviroment  [fm1,-]. The smoke from the cigarette is a kind of poisonous gas which make [vp3,2-]  our air unclear and dirty. If the number of smokers is keeping on increasing, our nature will turn bad. The whole world has to face the problem. In order to let our children live a nice and happy life, we must solve the problem of cigarette smoking. Many people in the world smoke. And the percentage of teenager is growing, as a local newspaper indicated. I don't know why those people enjoy smoking so much, although some of them say smoking excite them and is a relaxation to them. I think those are just excuses. I think they should face the fact that smoking is very harmful and give it up.   I've read many articles about the harm that smoking will do to the smokers. One thing is that smoking too much will lead to lung cancer. I think this is frightening and all the smokers should be aware of [wd5,s-] . A great number of people die of lung cancer each year in the world. The other thing is that smoking will do harm to the people around you as well and the arm is even more serious. The articles indicat [fm1,-] that if the pregnant women smoke, the chances of their babies getting malformed are higher. In my opinion, smoking in public places should be prohibited and to those who break the law, punishment should be given. So, if you will [vp6,-s]  care of the others, if you are a responsible person, please give up moking. Cigarette lovers say that smoking is very enjoyable. It can ring you to be in high spirits and make you to [wd5,2-]  be capable of thinking. But in my opinion, cigarette [fm1,-]  smoking only causes bad result. Too much smoking will do much harm to your health. When ou are smoking, the smoke from the cigarette seems to be all given [wd4,s-]  out through your mouth. But in fact, most of the ingredians [fm1,-] of the smoke have already gone into your lung through your throat. These ingredians [fm1,-] can make you get ill. It is these things that cause cancer. Smoking also pollute the air. When a person who doesn't smoke lives together with the cigarette-smokers, this person can also be effected [wd2,0-1]  by the smoke. As time passers [fm1,-]  by, he also make [vp7,2-]  ill by the polluted air. In a word, cigarette smoking is no good. It should be forbidden in public and we should persuade the smokers to give up smoking. If there were no cigarette smokers in the world, there would be ewer [fm1,-]  people who  died from [wd3,1-1]  cancer. As we all know, many people in the world smoke cigarette [np3,s-] . In China most of them are men. I think cigarette smoking is harmful to Man's [fm3,-]  body.   Some people may know the harm of cigarette smoking, but in order to get their spirits excited, they smoke it, even [wd5,-s] they are clear about the bad aspect. because [fm3,-]  there are poisonous matters n [fm1,-]  the cigarette, when it is burnt, the poisonous matters are breathe [vp5,1-0]  into men's bodies from their mouth [np3,1-0] .Second, if a person who smokes cigarette, the smell from his mouth is unpleasurable [fm1,-]  fm1,-]. Sometimes there is the smell of smoking in his clothes, his sheet and his room. So I can say cigarette smoking d [vp3, 1-] o more harm to men's bodies than do [wd6,s-]  good. I hope he number of smoker [np3,2-]  is getting fewer and fewer. I don't like people [sn8,s-]  smoke, especially in the public place [np3,- s]  such as in [pp1,0- 2]  the bus, the lift or the restaurant. I'm not a smoker, but why do [vp7,0- 2]  we [pr1,s-]  forced to be a second-hand smoker? Cigarette smoking is harmful to people's health. It can cause cancer and heart disseas [fm1,-]. Smoking can give people a bad image. How do [vp8,0-5]  you feel if you saw a child smoking or a pretty girl wearing a beautiful dress moking [fm1,-]  in the street? According to the doctor, the amount of death of second-hand smoker is more than that of smoker. [sn8,s]Although there are [sn8,-s]  many places are no-smoking places, there are still many people smoke regardness   [fm1,-] of the advice. I think we should educate them since they were a child [np3,3-0] . This is also a problem of education. The use of computers bring [vp3,3-]  convinents   [fm1,-] to our world, bring [vp3,s-]  high speed to the work, free [vp3,s-]  many many workers labour [wd7,1-] . But some bad person [np3,2-] use computer for crime, [wd4,s-]  do harm to other people. Since 1960's, the first computer came into our world, people's life changed [vp6,s-]  a lot[sn8,s-]. Before the existence of computer, people had to count the complicated figues [fm1,-] for a long time. But since that computers can settle this problem in one second or minute. Computers can be used in nearly every fields [np3,1-] , the [wd5,-1]  bussiness [fm1,-], the [wd5,-1] madication [fm1,-], the bank the education, and so on.Of cause [wd3,1-0] ,the most important is used in science , [sn8,s]it make [vp3,1-]  our world's [np4,0-1]  development [wd4,3-3]  fast and fast [ad3,2-0] . But people are afraid of some bad person [np3,2-]  use [vp5,s-]  computer to do crime [cc1,-1]things. These bad person [np3,2-]  can make [wd3,-] some virus to computers.. and so the Chip stored in the computer will be demadge [fm1,-] , or they use the computer to find out the secrets in [wd3,0-2]  the bank, and take the money out and so on. So I said [vp6,-s] , one most important hand [cc4,3-], the use of computer help [vp3,3-]  people very very much. on [sn9,-]the other hand, it do [vp3,1-]  arm [fm1,-]  to some people. My View on Studying Abroad In my opinion, studying abroad can provide us with a good environment, specially [wd3,s-]  for the students who majoy   [fm1,-] in foreign languages. It's good for us to be independent. Also it's a good chance for us to train ourselves. Studying in a foreign country can offer you much more chances to practise. Oral English is very poor in our country,[sn8,s] the most important reason is that we lack practice. In a foreign country you have to use English to communicate with others. So you have to speak English almost all the time. It's in such an environment that lead [vp3,6-]  you to practise your oral English naturally [fm1,-] .Practise more and you'll get more progress. Because you have to adapt [vp1,-1]  a new environment, you'll meet many difficulties. You have to handle all the things by yourself. It's [pr1,-2]  good experiences for one's growing up. It can make you understand the importance of Independence [fm3,-] . So I think studying abroad is challenging. It's a good chance for you to prove your abilities. It's very important for us to use the knowledge we earned [fm1,-]  from the books into practice. My view on studying abroad is it can help one get more knowledge and also it is good to [pp1, 0- 2]  one's study. It could enlarged [vp5,1-]  one's eyeview [fm1,-] . Compared with U.S.A, Japan, England and other countries, our countries [fm2,-]  is still poor though she makes [vp6,s-]  great progress [fm1,-] . Our education is still poor. Study abroad [sn2,s-] , one can get better situation equipment [cc1,1-]  for study. In order to adapt the life [cc3,2-]  there, one must learn to form the habit to do [vp5,2-]  the [wd5,-]  things like the native citizens. That can greatly help one to form his charactors [fm1,-], temper [cc3,3-] ,etc. Study [vp5,-s]  abroad can learn [cc2,3-]  many things that are greatly different from one's own. In some modern countries, the equipment is very modern, the administrate [wd2, 2-1]  is also efficient. That can save work and time and high speed [cc3,6-] . The one who study [vp3,2-]  abroad can learn all these. These are good for him. Many things abroad are different  [fm1,-] from ours. These can larged [fm1,-]  one's eyeview [fm1,-] . So if someone pay [vp3,1-]  attention to everything he see [vp3,1-0] . hear [vp3,2-] [wd5,1-1]  .do [vp3,3-] , he can learn a lot, that's good to study abroad. [sn1,s]Now more and more people go abroad to study further. What causes them to do so? I think studying abroad can do some good to us, but [wd5,s-] is it necessary. Because the facilities in foreign countries are more advanced than ours, the atmasphere [fm1, -] and environment there are benefit [cc2,6-]  for studying, the teachers are more qualified, if we go abroad, we may learn more that we can not learn in our native country. [sn1,s]But some persons who want to study abroad are for one purpose[sn8,s] -- stay there and become its citizens. Although we can not say that all of them are guilty [wd2,s-] , what they do is against the ethics. Since we are numbers [wd3,0- 3]  of our motherland, we should do our best to devote ourselves to her, using what we have learned. So studying abroad is a useful way to gain more knowledge and experience. But at the same time we should set up a goal that it is for our country.Nowadays [fm1,-] , many people go to study abroad. Most of them are graduate [fm1,-]  students, some are Masters. [sn9, s-] [sn1,s]some[fm3,-] are Doctors. In my opinion, studying abroad really do [vp3,3-]  good to them, of course do good to our country too. [sn2,s-]  After several years of domestic study, excellent students have a strong basic [wd4,3-2]  of knowledge. They wish o learn more advanced skill [cc3,3-].Studying in a foreign university may solve this problem. In some developed countries, like U.S.A, there are many famous universities, such as Harvard, Princeton, university [fm3,-]  of California and so on. They can offer the most advanced knowledge for students to learn. Furthermore, living in a foreign country can open your eyes. The students can contract [fm1,-]  the society directly, see everything by their eyes [sn2,s-] . They can familiar [wd2, 0-1]  with the costoms  [fm1,-], make friends with foreigners [sn2,s-] . Besides, they can improve their spoken English rapidly. These are what they can't learn from books so easily. t the same time, studying abroad make them independent. They must do part-time job [vp3,4-]  to pay for the tuition and living expense. It's a common phenomenon abroad, no labour no money. How to making [vp5,2-]  a living is what they must think about. When they finish the study abroad, some of them will come back to [wd4,-1]  motherland together with the knowledge and skill [vp3,s-] . Obviously, this kind of people will make outstanding achievement [vp3,4-]  to [pp1,-2]  our country. All in all, studying abroad is good to the development of our country, is good to the students themselves [sn2,s-] . They will play major parts in the four modernizations. My View on Studying Abroad From the middle of 1980's, more and more young people or mid-aged [fm1,-]  people prefer studying abroad to studying in their own countries, because they think it's a good way to improve their study. But I don't  think so. Of course, in other countries, there are many international universities, such as Harvard University and Oxford University, they are well equipped.They have many famous professors and good condition for study. They also offer grants, aids and loans.But, as we know, the tuition of the private universities is uite expensive. Many students have to do past-time job [vp3,5-] o pay for it. When the students are free from class, they have o work on campus or off campus. That means they have no free time all the [wd5,1-1]  day. What a hard life they live! The worst thing about the students or scholors [fm1,-] studying abroad is that when they graduate, they don't want to go back to our countries [fm2,-] . They just stay at the countries which offer them high income and work for them. It's unfair. Our motherland spent so much on their study, but they make achievement for other countries. When someone have he ability to study abroad, they can do it. But they must remember that they are members of Chinese, they must serve China when they complete heir study. I hope that one day I can have the apportunity [fm1,-] to study abroad. Nowadays, studying abroad can do good to one person or his country. Studying abroad may open your own eyes. You can learn a lot of things that you can't do in your own country. Such as the customs of the foreign country, the civilizations, the education, the medication system, and so on. All these can make your spirits rich. And if you are patriotic, you can study the advantage part of civilization of the abroad. If it can be developed in your own country, you can return your homeland and work hard to realize it. There are many examples in our[wd5,-1] China, such as Mr Qian xuesheng, Mr Hua Luogeng, etc. So, if you have the chance to study abroad, go ahead without hesitation. here are more and more students that studying abroad nowadays. On the one hand, it is good. So that our nature will get stronger by speed. On the other hand, a few students have been attracted by other developed countries and have become the citizens of other countries. And, It's award lifeship to live abroad. The students studying abroad can learned much advance skill from other countries and bring the good thing back to contribute for our nature, so that our country gets stronger and stronger. But our country is not much rich than the developed countries. Some students didn't want to e back and work for other countries. It's also a lost of our nature. Then, it's hard to live without help, when you leave you country. In other to earned money, you have to do part-time jobs. So, in my opinion, study abroad is a thing with advantage and disadvantage. It depends. If you want to do something of use for our county. Just study hard, and come back to our country and work for it. That's a good way.  I don't like people smoke, especially in the public place such as in the bus, the lift or the restaurant. I'm not a smoker, but why do we forced to be a second-hand smoker? Cigarette smoking is harmful to people's health. It can cause cancer and heart disease. Smoking can give people a bad image. How do you feel if you saw a child smoking or a pretty girl wearing a beautiful dress smoking in the street? According to the doctor, the amount of death of second-hand smoker is more than that of smoker. Although there are many places are no-smoking places, there are still many people smoke regardless of the advice. I think we should educate them since they were a child. This is also a problem of education. The Use of Computers With the development of economics [wd3,3-] , computers come into many people's daily lives. Computers are the most remarkable things that were [vp6, s-]  invented in his century. They can do all kinds of things. With their help, people can lead an easy life. Computers have various uses. For example, they can calculate complicated math's problems, store the details that you often need, help you to write letters, and even play games with you. Besides the daily uses, computers can also be used to do things that people can't do or will not do. For instence [fm1,-], once installed, they can guide the robots to carry heavy things, to do dangerous things for people and so on. In short words, computers are really quite helpful to human beings. With their help, people can do many things easier [cc5,3-]  and more sucessful [fm1,-] [cc5,6-] .   The use of Computers Nowaday [fm1,-], computers are used more and more ordinary [cc5,4-] . Not only in a company [fm2,-]  but also in the family [fm2,-] . I think computer is one of the best friend of the human being. Using[wd5,-s] computer can make our life more convenient. In the modern super market [fm1,-] , the sales no need [vp9,1-1]  to count [cc2,4-]  the price of each goods [cc4,1-] , he or she just show [vp3,4-]  the computer [cc1,-1]lines which painted on the goods to the computer, then the computer will count for you [pr1,s-] , this save [vp3,1-]  many times [np5,1-] and labors [np5,0-] .Computers can develope [fm1,-] the telecommunication. People can use the E-mail to communicate with each other. Even thought [fm1,-]  you are in different places or country [np3,2-] . You can talk with your friend not only can hear his voice [sn7,s-]  but also you can see his face which is showed on the computer. I think computer will be more and more small [aj3,3-]  and cheaper and cheaper [wd6,1-] . At that time, everyone will have a computer and our life will be more frequency [cc1,4-] . Nowadays, more and more people use computers because of its convenientness[fm1,-]and modernization [wd3,1-] . Most of the people use it in their daily life and working field [wd4,1-] . Computers can be used in many many ways. In our daily life, we use it to play TV games, listen to the CD or watch VCD and most of the important [aj3,3-] , using [wd5,-s]  a computer can make our life more convenient and comfortable. we an do shopping without stepping out of home, we can receive and sent [fm2,-]  information easily and quickly. We just need to push the buttom [cc3,2-]    [fm1,-], and all of these can be realized. In our working field [cc4,1-] , we use computer to control the production, the labor robot [cc1,1-]  and all of the work that people used to do. We can even use it to couculate  [fm1,-], measure [cc3,1-] , test [cc3,2-]  and so on. In a word, computers are playing an important role in our society. Without it everything will become difficult, because we are use to such a Computerlizing [fm1,-] society. Nowadays, the use of computers is so popular [sn8,s] . Nearly all the companies have their own computers.  And people also need to learn how to use computer. The use of computers is very convinent [fm1,-] and have many advantages [sn6,s-] . First, it save [vp3,1-]  time and labour. Because computers are easy to control, it [np3,5-]  also work fast. People only need to press the button, they can do what they need to do. [sn1,s]Such as reading the data, typing some documents, etc. Second, it can save a lot of documents and data. Although a computer is very small. But you can type many documents in it or [cj1,s-]  save the data what [pr5,-]  you want. The memory of a computer is very big. [cc2,6-]  You can find the deta    [fm1,-] in computer easily. So, the use of computers is more and more popular nowadays. It not only save [vp3,3-]  time and labour, but also is easy to control. The birth of the computers is a new revolution in the industry, maybe, we can say so. [sn8,s]The application of it to the industry has brought much affection [cc3,2-] . Computers can take over the people in the difficult condition which is too hot or too cold for person [wd4,0-] . It can also simply [wd2,0-]  the work procedure, free the people from hard work [sn2,s-] . Nowaday [fm1,-], computers have been developed at the [np7,1- 2]  unbelievable speed. It has been applied in every field, even in some developing country [np3,2-] , such as our country.  Some people prodict [fm1,-] that the computer will take the place of human being in work. Of course, computers can't work without the person's [np4,1- 1]  control. The computer's complete use [cc4,1-]  claims.people's rich knowledge. without [fm3,-] the [wd5,-2]  enough knowledge to control the computer. people will not be freed from the hard work. As we all know, computers are getting more and more popular to [wd5,-1]  nowadays, because they are widely used. Computers can be used in a lot of area [fm2,-] , and give people a lot of help. With their help, people can solve many complicated questions [cc3,3-]  simply. n a library with computer system, when you want to find a book [sn8,s]  , you needn't find a guided [cc4,-1]car or hold it to find the book what you need one bookcase by another.[sn8,s] You just need to put the information about our wanted book, then the computer will tell you where you can get it. What a simple thing! In a reference room, when you want to find some reference unusual [wd1,1-]  , if you just find it by yourself, maybe you have to spend much time on it, sometimes you can't  find it [cc6,-1]completely. But, with computer's help, you will find a thorough reference [cc4,1-]in a few minutes. Expecially [fm1,-], computers are widely used in modernized factories. In those factories, computers are used to control the machines, to do dangerous, and handwork instead of people [sn2,s-] , to deal with complicated information and so on ... With their help, the factories, and improve the labour rate and gain more profits.[sn8,s]computers [fm3,-]  are one of the most important invention [np3,5-]  in the 20th century. They have helped people a lot and scientists are working hard to make they [pr4,1-1]  help people more. As the technology developing [sn2,s-] , the use of computer is being common and common [aj3,2-] . This brings convenience to the people. Most people use this convenience to do good things, while some others are on [pp1,-2]  the opposite. Now the use of computers is already throughout the world. [sn8,s] When people need some messages or information, they can open their computers [cc3,2-] ,so one or several minutes later, they will get the information which they can.[sn2,s] [sn1,s]Another use is that people can use their computers to send messages or information .If they want to send their information to another country or continent, the only thing they need to do is, [sn9,-]  sitting [vp5,s-]  at home and open their computers [cc3,2-]  to send out it [wd1,2-] . there [fm3,-]  is also bad point of [pp1,2-3]  the use of computers. Some people use computers to [pp1,-1]  crime, this is forbidden by the law. That is, take he good point of the use of computers so that we can make good use of them. [sn8,s] Computer is more and mare [fm1,-]  important to our lives. Computer help [vp3,1-]people do many things, such as doing the housework. [sn8,-s]help to the research work, control [vp4,-]the machines. Computer is wildly use [fm2,-]  in our lives [wd3,2-]  now. Computer is equipped in many machines, such as TV set refrigirator [fm1,-], washing machine and other things. With the help of the computer ,man's life is easier and freer. Computer can diposite [fm1,-] much information , this can help to [wd5, 2-3]  the research work, save time for the scientists to do more important things [sn2,s-] . Computer can also controll [fm1,-] the machines. In a factory, without man's controll [fm1,-] , it do [vp3,1-]  it [pr1,2-] . It does it [pr1,2-]  by the turn which have [vp3,3-]  been diposited [fm1,-] before. [sn8,s]This can save both man's labour and time In a shop, it help [vp3,1-]  to calculate the money, the payment [sn2,s-] . In a bank, it could do all the work without man's help, all man had [vp6,s-]  to do depress[wd3,s-] [sn8,s-] some bottoms [sn2,s-] . Computer also help [vp3,2-]  the students study. It diposite [vp3,1-] [fm1,-] much information, when the student want to know the very [cc4,-1]data, it can "give" you, saving the students [np4,1-] ' time to look for the information in the library. [sn1,s]Computer can help the police to look for the murderer [fm2,-] , prisoner [fm2,-] . with the help of the computer, more and more prisoners are caught [vp6,s-] . Computer is more and more importance [wd2,3-]  to our lives [wd3,1-] . any people have known [vp6,s-]  it. More and more people get use to [vp2,2-]  the computer which makes man's  life easier, freer. In some developed countries such as America, English [wd2,0-]  and Australia, the using of computers is very common. We an see that in China nowadays, more and more people've learned to use the computers. I think it's a good thing. Because in my opinion, useing [fm1,-] computers has two good effects [np5,2-] .As we all know, a computer can store many useful materials. So if we use computer, it will both save us time and trouble. It's  especially useful to the hosptials [fm1,-], schools and factories those [pr1,-]that need to keep many materials. And it's also very convenient for them to control them.Using computers will make your work more effitive [fm1,-] is the first thing I want to mention [sn8,s] . The second one is, [sn2,s-]  according to scientists, using computers will help to develop children' IQ [np4,1-] . nowadays [fm3,-] , there are lots of well-designed computer games for kids. By playing them , children [np4,- 3]  thinking and reaction are trained. And it's helpful. Above we have mentioned the good sides of using the computers. Here, I would like to remind the parents, [cj1,-]all the things have their bad sides, don't let your kid stay in front of the computer all day long, it does no good to his study nor his health. [sn1,s] My View on Study [vp5,1-]  Abroad[sn9,-] One day one of my friend [np3,3-]  asked me a question, "What's your opinion on studying abroad?" "How to say, all things have good sides and bad sides. But I think it's quite good for some people." Why? As we all know, in order to develop the economic [wd2,s-]  in China, there are [vp3,-2]  so much we can learn from [wd4,- 2]  developed countries. Such as science and technology, medicine, the business  managment [fm1,-] and so on. We can sent [fm2,-]  our skillful workers and colleage  [fm1,-]-graduates to be trained. Another reason,[sn2,s] studying abroad helps to broad [wd2,2-2]our mind and train our character. And it helps a person to gain more experience. In order to survive, one had [vp6,s-]to  be more independent.He will learn how to support [cc3,-2]his life and study by doing part-time [wd4,-]. He will learn how to get on well with each other [pr1,1-]. But I don't think the people with weak character and know little English should go abroad. [sn6,s-] My View on Study [vp5,1-]Abroad[sn9,-] Many people want to study abroad.They have various aims, to earn money in spare time, to get the chances to live abroad in the future or to get more knowledge. If one wants to get knowledge, I think studying abroad is a good thing. In developed countries, their education is better than ours, their Equiments  [fm1,-] are more morden [fm1,-] and maybe their ways of teaching are more lovely [cc2,5-] . Studying abroad can give us better conditions. Many students studying abroad do part-time jobs in their spare time. It can help them get more knowledge from societies [fm2,-] . Studying abroad can also bring extra information to the students,such as the customs, the manners, the festival [fm2,-] , etc. In a word, if you have the correct aims of studying abroad and try your best at the same time, you can learn more and, maybe, better. My View on Studying Abroad Studying abroad is a good thing for the ones who want to learn more. It's true that in some fields [wd3,s-]  Chinese Universities [fm3,-]  study equipments [cc1,1-]  are not so good as some foreign countries, such as America, Canada, [wd4,s-] Janpan[fm1,-]. The students go abroad and study the better mouthed [fm1,-] . They can make good use of the wonderful facilities. Secondly, they can learn from the foreigners not only the knowledge, but also the good abilities [np5,0-]  [cc3, s-] . After studying abroad, they come back . Then they always [ad1,1-1]  can make achievement [np3,4-]  for our country. But there is another question we have to pay attention to, that is, some people would not come back after finishing their study. They envy the comfortable life there and don't want to devote themselves to our country any more. That's no good for them. So, I think it is good to study broad, but in the bad [cc4,-1]case,it's not good. My View on Cigarette Smoking In my opinion, cigarette smoking is a bad habbit [fm1,-]. It not only does harm to one's health and also does no good to others.    Cigarette smoking will lead to the [wd5,-2]  lung cancer. Many investigation results prove that most of the patients of lung cancer smoke. Because there are some harmful sources in cigarette, it'll do harm to one's health and make one's teeth dirty. And even more [cj1,2-]  when some one is smoking, the persons near im also smoke, even if they aren't cigarette smokers.    So I think cigarette smoking is harmful. The smokers should try to get rid of the bad habbit [fm1,-]. Everybody should pay more attention to one's health.     As a rule, girls don't think smoking is a good thing, I am no exception o the rule. Some of my friends like smoking and tell me smoking [vp1,2-] .    One of the reason [np3,3-]  why most men smoke is they think smoking can work when they felt [vp6,s-]  unhappy or lonely. But I  don't think so.Because I haven't seen or heard that someone can solve his of her problems with the help of cigarette smoking. It is useless at all. And, it is a common sence [fm1,-] that smoking will do harm to our health. Many elements in cigarette will poison our bodies and bring many diseases [cc3,2-] . And also [cj1,1-] , smoking will be more harmful when there are children or old men nearby. Because they are not strong  enough to resist the harm that cigarettes bring.    In a word, cigareete [fm1,-] smoking is useless when you meet trouble, it will do harm to you if you take it and it is more harmful to children and old men. So I don't think cigarette is a good thing.     In my opinion, cigarette smoking is harmful to human beings. And I think that everybody who has such a hobby had better get rid of it.    I don't know why so many people like smoking because I've ever tried it. But  I heard from my friends who smoke that when they felt lonely or boring [vp5,3-]  they would smoke. But I think it [pr4,s-]  just some excuses [np3,3-] , they can have other entertainment [np3,1-]  to replace it. Morever [fm1,-], according to scientific reports, smoking is quite harmful to one's health. We all know that cigarette includes some intergredians [fm1,-] which do no good to our body. For instance, negudine [fm1,-] brings cancer to those who smoke year after year and many of them die of it. [sn6,s-]  Finally, smoking costs so much money that could be used in a better way. Every year, the [wd5,-4]  people of the world spend more than [sn5,-3]  hundreds of billions [wd5,3-]  on cigarette [fm2,-] . And think about it: how many people starve to death in poor areas? And of [fm1,-]  only we could use the money there.    People who smoke say it's hard to keep away from cigarette. I don't think so. Even the drug-takers can get rid of drugs, then why can't they? With determination, people can manage to stop smoking. And that's my hope.    In my opinion, cigarette smoking is not a good behaviour [fm1,-]. It should be prohibitted [fm1,-].    Cigarette smoking does harm to people's health. On one hand, [wd5,-s]  cigarette people smoke, the more diseases he gets. We all know that cigarette smoking is the main cause that lead to [wd6,3-]  lung cancer. Moreover, it is also the cause that lead to many other diseases. On the other hand, cigarette smoking not only does harm to the smokers themselves, but also does harm to other people around them when they are smoking. A Medical Scientist said that the fume the smokers exhale, the people around him inhale are as harmful as, [sn8,s] or more harmful then the non-smokers smoke themselves! I also think that cigarette smoking polutes  [fm1,-] the air around us.    We often see the sign "non [fm1,-] -smoking" in the buses, rains or other public places. In order to protect your health and other people's health, I advise that the smokers should give up smoking.    In the world, many people smoke. But I don't like smoking. I also dislike the person who smokes.   Smoking does harm to people's health. Smoking can cause cancer Brocrotical [fm1,-] and so on. Every year thousands of people died of disease that smoking cancer.[sn8,s] But there are many people smoking [sn9,-]  especially young people. I think it is very terrible. On the other hand, smoking causes an unpleasant smell. If one person smokes in a public place, there are clouds of smoke in it. So many people who don't smoke think it unbearable.    Smoke has other harm to people. So it's good for smoking people to give up it [wd1,2-] . Nowadays some young men begin to smoke. It is very terrible. The country must take action to prevent young man [np3,s-]  from smoking. I hope in the future no one smoke in the world.      I don't like cigarette, and I also don't agree at [vp2,1-2]  cigarette smoking.    Everyone knows cigarette is harmful. Studies has showed that all things in cigarette is [vp3,3-]  harmful. Few people  know exactly what they are. I don't know either. but I know that smoker usually has some disease [np3,1-]in his lung, which cause [vp3,s-]  to reduce [cc3,-2]his life. I think everyone wants to live longer, while cigarette smoking cause to short [wd2,2-2]  you life. Why are there still so many mokers? Cigarette smoking also cost [vp3,2-]  very much. Each cigarette cost [vp3,2-]  about several Jail [fm1,-] . If one person has ten cigarette [np3,1-]  every day, then it will cost several Yan. Then each month you will cost [wd3,s-]  nearly one hundred Yan to buy cigarette [fm2,-] .Why don't you have this money bought [cc2,3-]  other thing [fm2,-]  useful [wd1,1-] ? Espescially   [fm1,-], some people have low salary. Now I find some students also [ad1,s-]  are smokers. We students should not do so because we can't earn money yet.    Cigarette is not a good thing to human being. It just do [vp3,2-]  harm to us and cost [vp3,s-]  our [pr4,1-1]  money, but don't give us something [pr6,3-]  useful. So if you are [vp8,s-]  a smoker, you should not [wd5,-1]  never have been a moker.    Cigarette smoking is a social topic that people have been scussing for a long time but still don't come to an agreement. Since there are so many people smoking in our country, it is ery difficult to forbit [fm1,-] it in a short time. So in my pinion, we should take certain useful measures again [fm1,-]  it step by tep.    As we all know, smoking does harm to our health. There are a number of person [np3,3-]  who have the habit of smoking for many years dying of cancer every year [sn8,s] . It is just one aspect. Further more [fm1,-] , t is also harmful to others who do not smoke. In a family, the d and the young are the victims of smoking. The poisonous smoke makes them feel uncomfortable and cough. It will even cause illness. The unpleasant smoke also pollutes our envrionment [fm1,-]. Imagine that [wd5,-s]  how terrible it is to live with the smoke surrounding us! Finally, the expanse [fm1,-]  on cigarette smoking is uncountable. I'd rather use the money to help the needed. Smoking just wastes our money and does no good.    In that case my view on cigarette smoking is although it can't begot rid of at once. [sn9,-]  it should disappear at last.    I don't like cigarette and I don't like the cigarette smoker  [fm2,-] . Everytime [fm1,-] I pass through [pp1,1- 3]  the cigarette store. I become [vp5,-1]resent at the seller. Every time a man smokes cigarette near me, I hate him. Sometimes I am very appalled [wd7,s-]  when the smoke [wd4,s-]  around me.    I hate cigarette no only because of its terrible smell, but also [wd5,5s-]  it does harm to people's health. I don't know why the smoker can stand the smell. It's said that cigarette smokers always suffer from the uncomfortable Desease [fm1,-] which cigarette brings to [pp1,1-1]  them. I know many people die of such kind of desease [fm1,-] every year in every  country.The World Health Organization has done much work in various ways to help people who smoke. It's very good of it [pr1,4-] .    I hope more and more people will object smoke [cc3,1-] , more and more people will be healthier and live longer.    I object strongly [ad1,2-]  to cigarette smoking. I don't like it at all, I don't like the people who smoke, either.    smoking [fm3,-]  is harmful to our health. It is said that cigarette smoker will have a lot of diseases, such [wd4,0-]  lung cancer, brochile  [fm1,-]. Smoking does harm to our [wd4,-s]  health not only the smokers, but also the people around the smoking zone[sn8,s-]. It is more harmful to the people who sit around them [wd5,s-]  the smoker himself. On the other hand, smoking also wastes a lot of money. It is reported that a smoker spends more than ten yuan in smoking a day.    Smoking does no good to our health and wealth. To  [pp1,-1]smokers, they should get rid of it. To [pp1,-]the[np7,-]other people, they should keep away from it. Without smoking, our enviroment [fm1,-] will became [fm2,-]  cleaner and cleaner.    I disapproval [wd2,-s]  of cigarette smoking. It is harmful to the smokers' health. The smokers will have many diseases because of cigarette, including cancer. On the other hand, the smokers will do harm to the people who stand near them.    Cigarette is made up of harmful things. Many scientists does [vp3,1-]  e experiments and show that the smoke of cigarettes can kill ome small animals. In fact, people have many various kinds of diseases by smoking, ranging from bronchic [fm1,-] to cancers. moking will shorten the life of the people. So do not smoke. If the [wd5,-1]  people smoke in public, the smoke will spreat [fm1,-] out nd the people nearby will be affected. So, in semi [fm1,-]  public places, people are not allowed to smoke. People do not like to walk close to a person who is smoking.    If you want to live a healthy  live [wd2,3-] , do NOT smoke. If you want to be a person who others like you [wd6,3-] , do NOT smoke.     Many people like smoking, but I hate cigarette smoking very much. I think it is very uncivil to smoke in the public [wd4,-] such as cinemas and hospitals.    Cigarette smoking does harm to people. Smoking is easy to cause lung disease [np3,-5]  like cough [vp5,1-3]  and lung cancer. Each year many people die of lung cancer and bronchitic [fm1,-]. Cigarette smoking is really harmful to people's health. Moreover, smoking pollutes the air. The smoke smells terrible and smoking in public always makes others feel uncomfortable. Cigarette smoking cost [vp3,1-]  people much money. Those who like smoking spend much money in buying cigarette [fm2,-] . If they get ill because of smoking, they also have to spend money in curing the diseases.    Cigarette smoking not only do [vp3,3-]  harm to you, but also do [vp3,s-]  harm to the people surround [vp4,s-]  you. Why not give up smoking? If you do so, you will be more healthy and you'll be stronger. Try it from today!     Just like many people, I opposite [wd2,s-]that persons like cigarette smoking. [sn8,s]    As we all know, cigarette smoking does harm to people's health, especially to our lungs. The people who like cigarette will have it at [pp2,-2]  many occasions, for example, when they are unhappy, when they are taking with friends, when they have finished meals, they would have it. But they miss [wd3,s-]  the harm that the cigarette  will bring---it improves [wd3,-s]  the rate of lung cancer. People having cigarette also pullutes [fm1,-] the surroundings. When someone is having cigarette, the smoking [wd3,1-]  spread [vp3,1-] , then other people around them may feel terrible and  can't bear it. Cigarette smoking is an enemy to the youths. When some young people don't want to study or work, and they just want to find some thing unexpected, they smoke. After smoking, they   feel comfortable and forget who they are. When they spend too much time on it, they will hate the  fact [wd4,1-]  then became [vp6,s-]  a robber [np3,s-] , a thief [np3,s-]  and so on.    Cigarette smoking do [vp3,1-]  a lot of harm to our lives, people who like it must give it up, and people who now dislike it must keep it off all the time.     Nowadays many people seems [wd5,-1]  like smoking, the old people, the youths, and even some children. In my opinion, it does no good. Scientists are worried about this situation. As far as I know, cigarette smoking is harmful to people's health. People that like smoking should give up this hobby.    Obviously, cigarette do harm to people, for example, smoke [vp5,s-]  cigarette too much will bring the illness [cc3,2-] , hurt people's throat d lump. There are much harmful substance inside cigarette. Not nly the people who smokes cigarette are hurt, but also the people do not smoke but sit near the smokers. That's [pr1,s-]  no use. Scientists have found the fact that the smoker often die [vp3,3-]  earlier than nomal  [fm1,-] people.Also some babies are hurt by their parents in a [np7,-1]  indirect way. It's unfortunetly [fm1,-] [wd2,s-] .    You can see many bad effords [fm1,-] from cegarette [fm1,-] smoking. It's very harmful for [pp1,1-1]  people's health. Though it's hard to give up smoking, why not have a try? The world will be more beautiful without smoking. My view on cigarette smoking is: please give up!     Wherever you go, you can see one or two or even more people smoking except in the No Smoking Zone. I hate to see this and hate the people who smoke.    Smoking is harmful to one's health. Not only the people who smoke but also the people who don't smoke are hurt. Smoking will cause some diseases, even the lung cancer which can  cause death. Furthermore, smoke can polute [fm1,-] the environment. Now the whether [fm1,-]  is changeable. The people who smoke should thing over it.            Smoking is harmful is harmful to the people and the environment. As a member of society, we should make the surroudings [fm1,-] more beautiful  and make the people healthy. So I hope the people who smoke can get rid  of it soon.     My view on cigarette smoking is that it does much harm to people's health and it costs much money.    The cigarette is very expensive now, especially the exited [wd2,-1]  one. The man who love [vp3,2-]  smoking can use: [sn9,-]  three or four bags of cigarette, that will cost too much money. If he doesn't smoke, he can save this sum of money to buy many other useful things. Also [wd6,-4]  at the same time,cigarette smoking does much harm to people's health, cigarette contains many harmful things, such as Go. [sn1,s]The man who like [vp3,2-]  smoking often has the brochcial [fm1,-] disease and the smoking speeds up to end of [pp1,1-2]  one's life. The man who smoking [sn2,s-] , the chances of getting illness is [vp3,s-]  much higher than the people who don't smoke. If someone smoke [vp3,1-]  in his family, it can also does harm to the family,especially the children. Many research work [np6,2-]  recover[wd3,s-]that smoking does much harm to people causes many diseases. [sn8,s-] .    So, in order to get rid of the harm that smoking gives you, ry to stop smoking. That can save your money and improve your alth.     Nowadays, there are many people smoke [sn8,s] , just because they think smoking is smart. But in my opinion, I think smoking is bad for people and also a bad thing [sn6,s-] . Why I have this idea? Because of the following reason [fm2,-] :    First, smoking is bad for our health. Because one of the ingredients in cigarette is nicotine, which is the substance to have [wd4,-1]  cancer. So when people smoke more and more, the opportunity to have cancer is bigger and bigger. Smoking will lead to cancer. Second, smoking waste [vp3,1-]money. A pack of cigarette is not cheap especially the cigarettes which export [vp7,s-]  form [fm1,-]  foreign countries. But cigarettes are not good for health. Why don't we use this money to buy some food to eat. So I think smoking is the same as money-burning [cc1,-] . It is a waste.    Because of these reasons, I think smoking is bad. It is not only bad for healthy [wd2,1-] , but also is money-wasting. So I don't like smoking and the people who  smoke.    Cigarette smoking is a way to waste your life  and do [vp3,s-]  harm to your health. I think if it is possible too close the Cigarette Product [wd3,1-1]  companies, then [wd5,s-]  we should close them in no time.    As  we know, the content of cigarette do [vp3,3-]  no good to human being's body. But a lot of people spend a lot of money on it every year. So it is a waste. The worse thing is that cigarette [fm2,-]  do harm to people's health, such as it can cause cancer easier [cc5,2-] , make the old people cough all day long [sn2,s-] ......    Some people said that cigarette can comfort people's feeling and give them many fun [cc4,1-] . But it is not the key point. it harm [vp3,1-]  your health, so we should get rid of it. 

<ST 5> <SEX 1> <Y 10> <SCH WSD> <AGE 20> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> My View on Studying Abroad I think studying abroad is generally good for a person. t is very important for everyone who would like to study abroad  to carefully choose a university or college where he can learn more and better than he can in his own country. There he is directed by good professors, competes with other students and studies a lot of advanced knowledge. In this way, he can really become a learned and able man. Besides tudy [fm1,-], he has to work to collect [wd3,0-2]  enough money for his tuition. While working, he comes to know the people, the customs and even the county's economy and polics [fm1,-]. That makes his life experience richer and helps [vp1,0-2]  to set up his own personality. in [fm3,-]  a work [fm1,-] , according to me, studying abroad does a lot of good to a person. My View on Studying Abroad In recent years, many students who had graduated from high school or from [wd5,4-0]  university went abroad to tudy [fm1,-]. In my opinion, studying abroad is a good thing to students, especially to Chinese students. First, studying abroad can make a student more independent in his life. They should study all by himself [pr3,5-0]  and get a part-time job for the income. Also they should solve problems which they met  [vp6,7-0] . Second, studying abroad can make a student know more about the tradition f other countries and make friends with foreigners. Third  [wd3,0-12] , studying abroad can have [vp3,3-2]  more knowledges [np5,1-]that can not learn   [vp7,4-0]  in China, such as the advanced techniques   [np5,2-0]  and the ways of management. In a word, studying abroad is necessary to [pp1,4-3]  more [wd5,0-2]  Chinese students. Because many Chinese students are too dependent to survial[fm1,-]  in society. My View on Studying Abroad I have never studied abroad, but I think it important and necessary to study abroad. As we know, science is developing fast today and knowledge [np7,0-3]  of past years is not enough for the development. We need the newest knowledge and skill. Being a new country, our country can't catch up with those countries which have developed for two hundred years on [pp1, 0-2]  some aspects. So I think it necessary for us to study abroad. It will take us learn the newest knowledge and skill in no time. It's the best way to make our country strong. e also know that there are differences among different countries. If we close the gate, others will not understand us and [cj1,5-4]  we will not know about others, too[wd3,13- 0] . Studying abroad will help us to see the view of the other countries society   [wd5,1-0] , then, we'll set up exchanging [cc4,0-1]  bridge [np7,1-0] . It's better than some countries become our enemies. Study [vp4,0-5]  abroad is a good way for us, I think so and let's go outing to have a look. My View on Studying Abroad[sn9,-] I like Studying [fm3,-]abroad, because I can have a further [cc4,-1]study and learn more things than my major[wd4,-]. Many universities are well equipped with modern facilities. Thus they offer a good condition [cc3,4-0]  to you, You can do experiments of high Level [fm3,-] . This [pr1,0-5]  is superior to our country. Besides this, there is active academic atmasphere [fm1,-] [np7, 4-0]   in many universities in foreign country [np6,1-0] . The students there are competitive. So you have to studied [vp4,2-0] hard. Only in this way can you learn more, and to [wd5,5-0]  be competitive. So this is another good condition for us to study abroad. So I have told you why I like studying abroad. Because there are the modern facilities and the active academic atmasphere [fm1,-], I would go to study abroad if I had a chance. The Use of Computers As is known, computers are useful and important in modern life. Computer can do many things for modern people. With a computer, people can manage work [cc3,1-0]  easily and conveniently. Now most the factories, companies are equipped with computers. The computers deal with the cases and store the information to [pp1,3-2]  the manager [np6,1-0] . This makes work easy. And now computers have been more advanced than before. A computer can do many things. For example, you can send or recieve [fm1,-] an E-mail with the help of the multi-media. You can get the information you want very soon. This saves muck time for you. So, computers are of great use, they have made so much work easy, people may be surprised at the strength of science and skills. The Use of Computers The development of computers is very fast. Most of companies have used computers to help their work. Even any families have owned their computers. n fact, computer is a useful tool to human being. The caculating [fm1,-] speed of computers is very fast. A computer can run many times at caculation [fm1,-]. Even [ad1,0-3]  some computers can run one billion times in a second. What's more, a computer can help people to get lots of massages by network. Also, it can help people to keep all the files in good order. Last [wd3,0-12] , a computer can help you to draw pictures and take wonderful photos. So, a computer is a helpful assistant. If you have a computer, you can do many things that you have never thought before. Also, you can do [cc3,0-3]  your work faster and better. The Use of Computers Computers have been widely used in many fields. They make people's work easier. For example, in a factory, there used to [,3-4]  a lot of workers doing the tedious and boring jobs. After [sn7,0-6]  computers are used, everything changes. The factory only needs some engineers to operate the computers which control the working robots. That helps the workers and the factory greatly. Now more and more people have personal computers. They use them to sort out the documents, write business letters, calculate and so on. In this way, people can sit at home and work. In a word: [sn9,-]  computers are useful and helpful to human beings. I don't like smoking. it [fm1,-]  is of no use but harm to smoke cigarette.Smoking is harmful to the body, this is known to all. [sn1,s]But I don't know why there are so many people enjoy smoking. Maybe most of them find there is fun in smoking. But I don't think so, I would feel unbearable rounded with smoke. [sn1,s]Smoking also waste [vp3,2-0]  money. It's known that many kinds of cigarette [np6,3-0]  are expenxive [fm1,-]. One smokes a lot may waste a lot of money. I don't think it's worth doing that.     After all, smoking is harmful and wasteful, I don't like it. [sn1,s]   Though a lot of people smoke, I dislike smoking. I think it harmful for us to smoke. I always object of [pp1,-]smoking.     In the world, there are so many people smoke [vp4,5-0]   today. The youth is the main part of the smoker [np6,8-0] . Why do they like smoking? In fact, cigarette smoking is not useful and it often does harm to your [pr1,20- 0]  health. It's said that cigarette smoking will cause some kinds of disease [np6, 3-0]  such as cancer, teeth illness. At the other hand, cigarette smoking will cause enviroment  [fm1,-] problem. If you come into a smoky room, how do [vp6,9-0]  you feel? The scientists say that staying in the smoky place is more harmful than smoking.      It's time for us to stop cigarette smoking all over the world. I think it will benef [fm1,-] it us and our children. In y opinion, cigarette smoking not only does harm to smokers, but also have an ill effect on others who don't smoke. So I think smokers should quit it and people who don't smoke should not try it.     It is well known to everybody that there is something bad for health in cigarettes. When people smoke, it naturally does harm to our organs, such as lungs. Although smokers can not feel anything in a shore time, its effects are going on continuously. 	When a smoker is smoking in public, he surely have [vp3,2-0] an ill effect on the people around. Because they smoke passively.Smoking in this way also cause illness [np6,1-0] .     In a word, people should be really aware of the bad effects of smoking and try not to smoke. Governments should decress [fm1,-] cigarette sale [np6,1-0] . The use of computers The computer appeared in 1960's and made great progress during the last years. computers are the very important partner of people today. I believe that the use of computers is necessary and wild [wd7,7-4]  in the morden [fm1,-] society. As we know, computers are now used as people's brain to deal with many kinds of things.They can work out much [wd3,0-1]  problem [np6,1-0]  in no time and work independently as what people have planned. The computer is just like a machine with people's brain, so you can save your time and strength with its' [fm1,-]  help. In another way, computers are being used in more any [fm1,-]  more field [np6, 3-0]  which people can't imagine. Robort  [fm1,-] is a kind of machine equipped with computer [np6,1-0] , so it can do something as people usually do. But [wd3,-s]  the robortn [fm1,-] can work in the poisonous condition without any human work under the water without danger [,17- 0] . In these fields people can control the robort  [fm1,-] to finish the heavy and dangerous work instead of themselves [sn9,-]  urring   [fm1,-] those processes, computer [np6,0-1]  make a great use. Today, computers are being used all over the world and in all the field [np6,2-0] .As a people who lives in morden  [fm1,-] society, we all should know the use of computer and learn to [vp1,1-0]  how to use it. Then we will enter a computer centery   [fm1,-] in the future.

<ST 5> <SEX 2> <y 10> <SCH WSD> <AGE 20> <WAY 2><DIC 2> <TYP 1>Advertising has been more and more prosperous in recent years. We can  see many bill-boards along the streets, or a lot of classified advertisements on TV, even a full-page advertisement in newspapers. Advertising has been [wd3,3-6]  a part of our everyday life [np6,6-0]. However [cj1,1-s], advertising has some positive effects on us and [wd4,-6] has some negative effects as well. As we all know , we are in a commodity economy society [np2, 5-0]. we need commodity production. Particularly to those enterprisers [fm1,-], [,4-s]  do every effort to make their products well-known, so that they can be in [wd4,1-2]   favorable condition among commerce [np6,2-0]  compete [wd2,1-] to put [vp1,1-5]  an advertisement on their products is a good way for this purpose. To consumers, [,2-10]  they can gain mush [fm1,-]  information on new or emproved [fm1,-]  commodities, then [sn9,-]  they may choose the most satisfied [aj4,2-1] ones. Advertising is being  becoming[sn8,2-] more and more important, so the rate of [wd3, 2-1] advertising is becoming more and more expensive. Many of [pp1,1-1]  manufactors [fm1,-] can not afford [fm1,-]  it [pr3,1-]. and  [wd3,-s] at the same time, some advertisements are exaggerated  [,4-2] even false, that will do [vp6,3-] harm to the consumers, and the enterprises at last [, -]. In one word, though advertising has some negative effects, its  positive aspects is [vp3,4-2] ore important. A famous person once aid [fm1,-] :" Friendship is marvelous thing. When you are happy, your happiness will be duble [fm1,-] ;  when you are sad, your sadness will be half. " This tells us what the value of friendship should be. I dare say here [wd3,-6]  is no one in the world  [sn8,s] can live without friendship. Friendship is essential to us just like air, sunshine and water. When one is growing up, from kinder-garden o higher educational institution [wd3,2-] , he needs to communicate with other people . He can learn more, know more from them, then he can perfect his life. Especially when one is in troubles, he often gets more help from his friends. At the same time, he would like [vp9,3-12]  to ask his friends to help than ask his parents or relatives. There is a saying: "A friend in need is a friend indeed. " All in all, friendship is of great value to our lives. Without it, we can not make our lives meaningful and colourful.Library [np6,1-]  is a wonderful place for people to buy or read books specially [fm1,-]  in higher educational institutes, libraries play an important role in wider [vp5,1-3]  [wd2,2-3] the students' knowledge. [sn1,s] With the developing of economy, people gradually[,7-9]  aware that more and further special knowledge is needed. A Library will help [vp1,1-2]   a lot. It content [vp6,2-0]  [wd2,1-0] all kinds of books and the collection is large.  It also classifies those books. People can easily find the books they want. Sometimes, one has to consult many many materials. he [fm3,-]can go to a library to look for any material then borrow them [pr3,8-0]. it [fm3,-]only costs him a little money. Moreover, Libraries are usually quiet place [np3, 5-0]. it has [,7-11]  much room for people to read books just in the library, that may save many [np8,-1]time. In one word, libraries bring much convenience to the culture and education course. Library is an important part of our society. Everything has its bright and dark sides. Advertising makes [wd3,2-2]  no exception. Positively [wd3,-1]  speaking, advertising brings people much convenience. Its versatile forms make this [pr1,1-1]  possible. Nowadays there are newspaper advertising, television advertising, computer advertising, person-to-person advertising and even retail [sn6,14-1] advertising. These offer more chances to [wd3,3-3]   people to compare, to choose the items they like and to decide hat they exactly want to buy. In addition to this, advertising keeps people informed [vp2,3-0]  of [vp1,2-7]  the development of the world around them. Whenever a new item is on display, it tells people that the world has stepped forward again. On [pp2,-4] the other side, advertising sometimes misleads people. It's quite common that several [,6-4] advertise that [wd3,1-2]  same item. In order to gain customers, they try their best to advertise it, including deceive in advertising regardless of the people [np4,1-0]  interests. [sn1,s] Unexperienced [fm1,-] people are often cheated and great harm is one [,10-5]  to them economically and mentally. This may be the mainly [wd2,2-1] reason we have the annual day for 'Protection of Consumers' Right'. So, while you're watching or admiring the beautiful  displays of advertising [aj4,5-1]items [sn9,-]remember [vp2,1-4]  keep your mind clear and your eyes sharp.   Bicycle theft has been a headache to bicyclists on campus. The Thieves are so crazy about bikes that they can act on any type no matter it's a funny day or a drizzling night, a public place or a quiet lot. The popular sentence said on campus 'The moment one have [vp3, 4-0] a bicycle, old or new, he's having the possibility of its being stolen the next moment,  [wd4,S-S] ' describes the serious case  vividly. Things being so [sn2,S-] , effective actions must be taken to reduce, let alone [sn6,9-6]  prevent, [sn9,-]  the ate of bicycle theft. First, bicyclists should equip their bikes with strong and complicated looks [fm1,-]  wherever they are and whatever time[wd3,-] it is, put the bikes among groups and try to bind [fm1,-]  them to the steel posts available. They should always warn themselves of carelessness and laziness such as leaving the keys in the locks. Second, more experience [wd2,1-1]  guards should be hired to around [wd2,3-2] the campus n watch for suspects [wd2,4-0] . More parking area [np3,3-0]  with cautious workers also helps to making [vp5,2-]  achieve his purpose. TO end with, making even effort [sn4,S-S]  to take good care of our bike is all we should do in case it leaves [wd3,4-5]  one day without saying "good-bye". GZ is one of the most busiest and modernized city of [wd3,1-0]  China and it has a large population. But there is an extremely serious problem in this city nowadays. That is , many people disobey the traffic rules. One of the cause [np3,3-0]  for this problem is that  the streets are too busy. GZ is also a larger industrialized city  [fm1,-]  and there are too many motor vehicles on the streets. So the drivers tent [vp6,4-0]  to disobey the rules. Another cause is that many people are in a hurry. So they ignore the rules. Finally, a third cause is that  there are not enough traffic lanes, that means, the people who disobey the traffic rules should be punished more heavily [wd3,5-0]  in case that the other people follow it  [pr1,s-] . As we all know, GZ's traffic problem is more and more popular [wd3,8-] , it    is obvious that we , every citizens [np3,2-0]  of [wd3,2-1]  it , should take some effects [wd3,-s]  at once in order to improve   [wd3,4-3]  the traffic problem.  Bicycle theft is [wd4,1-2]  common phenomenon on [wd3, 0-3]  the university campus. It will not surprise anyone if you say your bike is [vp6,11-1]  stolen. As a matter of fact, most of our bicycles are from the black-market. Many of the thefts are one [fm1,-]  by people from outside the campus  [,s-s] but we can't deny that there as been caught some student thieves. it is a shame that there re thieves among the university students. They steal not only bikes, but also money , clothes and books. Some steal for a want of money, but some may not. One [wd7,1-]  in a TV programme  [fm1,-] , a juvenile confess [vp6,8-10]  that he stole things from his classmates just for fun, because life was empty, a successful theft gave him a sense of achievement. The university is [wd4,1-2]  main place to cultivate [wd3,1-1]  knowledgable [fm1,-] and law-abiding [fm1,-] citizens. however  [fm3,-] , we do not feel so secure when here  [wd3,1-s]  arebicycle theft, clothes theft, [wd4,6-3] books theft occurring, how could we feel sure about building a secure and civilized society. Friendship is like sunshine in our life [np3, 2-0] . it gives us happiness [sn9,-]  encouragement and inspiration. I think that friendship is the biggest wealth in our life   [np6,3-0] . I have always had [vp6,4-9]  several good friends in the different period of [wd4,5-1] life. Before going to school, I played a lot with Sunny, who was a bright and helpful girl. Under her influence, I became more cheerful and intelligent .In middle school   [sn9,-]  I made friends with Kate [sn9,-]  who was sanguine and forthright [wd7,5-0] . Kate was my best admirer and severest [aj3,1-1]  criticizer [wd2,1-0]. She encouraged me when I failed and pointed out my faults bluntly     [fm1,-] . with the company [fm1,-] of my good friends, I have lived [vp6,10-5]  a happy and full life. whenever I face difficulties, my friends are there for me. their love provides me with support, their help has solved many of my problem [np3, 4-0] . I treasure the friendship I have. I also realize that friendship doesn't only mean receiving.   Understanding lienience [fm1,-] and selflessness [fm1,-]  are [np6,5-6] important elements to cultivate [wd3,3-3] real friendship. If I could really become invisible, I would asked [vp2,2-0]  the teacher for one weeks [np4,2-]  eave, and   [vp8,s-s] enjoy an exciting and free holiday. however [fm3,-]  I wouldn't like to be in that state too long --- what is the difference between an invisible man with [wd3, 4-4]  a passed away man,   [,s-s]  if you could not be acknowleged   [fm1,-] hugged and smiled at . .. Of course it would be very funny if you couldn't be seen, you'll be free to do anything you like. The first thing I would do is to take a trip around the world. I  [vp8, 12-5] take plane free of charge, I visited [vp8,1-2]   any place and I can [vp8,2-6]  use or touch anything I want. and [fm3,-]  I would go to the Britain Museaum    [fm1,-] and have [vp8,1-7]  a stroke [wd7,3-5]  on Monolisa's hand or hair, I would strut   [fm1,-]  into Cliton's  [fm1,-]  office and have a look at the documents and notes on his table. I would spy on someone and find out if he is making any plan against China. I would steal one of Michaed [fm1,-]  Chang's volleyball pat [np3,5-] , because my roommate is so mad about him that she would really love the souvenir. However, I would come back in the seventh day. One can't be away from his home too long. After all, I have my study, my friends and my family here. I certainly would like them to listening [vp5,5-2]  to me and see how excitedly [ad2,4-2]  I was after the trip and I would like y roommate to embrace me and thank me for the present I brought o her. More important[aj3,1-2] of all,I ought to make my present in the class because my seven day leave has come to the end. For a long time, many people had [vp6,s-4]been trying to find a way to make themselves invisible. Being invisible, you could do anything you want to do. However, an invisible life is not so good as you thought, because it means loneliness. If you were invisible, you would find yourself in the most free world. You could do what you like, say, travel [vp4,2-3]  around the world, without paying attention to any limits such as laws, money and responsibilities. When you felt hungry, you could have any food you like even if it is very expensive. You could stop in any brilliant house or hotel and live there comfortably. You could act as a hero to help others with no difficulty. Maybe you would be able to get rid of the contrast between the rich and the poor by giving the money you took from the rich to the poor. Nobody would charge you. However, whatever big [wd3, 1- 5]  advantages being invisible would bring, the person invisible could not avoid being lonely. since you could not be seen by others, nobody could understand you. There would be no concern, no love, and no company [wd3,2-] . Everybody would ignore your existence. you might be a very successful person, but no one would know your achievements. Therefore, being invisible, you would be in a heaven of freedom and a hell of loneliness. It never comes [vp6,3-1] true, but there is no harm in dreaming of it. Bicycle theft has become a serious problem on campus. Most of the students have to worried [vp5, 3-1]  about their bicycles. In order to protect our bicycles from being stolen again, we should do something to prevent theft. Almost every student who used [vp6,5-1]  bicycle has the experience of losing bicycles. almost [fm3,-]  every student who has lost his bicycles [np3,8-0]  would refer[wd3,-] to buy a second-hand bicycle which is much cheaper than a new one. However,  most of the second-hand bicycles are stolen from other students. The thieves continue to steal bicycles because they know whenever they succeed in getting one, they can easily  sell it on campus for [wd3,4-4]   a much lower price, say, sixty yuan, then [wd3,s-] a new one in the shop is more than three hundred yuan. Therefore , the more  bicycles are stolen, the ore people want to buy second-hand bicycles, and the more bicycles are stolen. This is a very bad circle. To solve the problem, we must work along two lines [wd3,4-] . First, we must strengthen the safeguard [vp2,3-] . Don't let the thieves to [vp2,4-4]  get bicycles so easily. Secondly, we should try to ban the second-hand bicycles because it may be stolen from one of our schoolmate [np3,4-] . If nobody want to buy the stolen bicycles, the thieves will not have their market [np3,3-] . All in all, bicycle theft has become more and more rampant [fm1,-]   [sn8,s] owing to the prosperity of the second-hand marker. We should secure the campus [vp2,3-2]  from thefts. besides [fm3,-] , we should not buy the stolen  bicycles. Although some people may complain that advertisements are cheating them and misleading them to buy the things they don't want, advertisement is still necessary to our life [np3,2-] . It played [vp6,1-S]  an important role in the development of our society, especially [wd4,7-4] the development of commerce. Whenever a new product comes on the market , it must be made known to people. we call this to 'open [wd3,1-2]  the market'. To open [wd3,-2] the market, advertisement is essential. well-designed  [fm3,-]  advertisements can help the manufacturers to publicize their products and secure customers by showing the attractive  [wd2, 3-] , good qualities of the products. The customers can also get familiar with the new products through advertisements. Advertising has become a branch of trade. As we all know, TV and radio stations are mainly financed by charges made for [wd3,-] commercial advertising in programms  [fm1,-] [sn9,-]  while newspapers are mainly supported by their classified advertisement columns. Without advertisement, most of the media will not exist. And our life  [np3,2-] will [vp8, 4-4] not be so various [wd3,2-] and colourful. Therefore, advertisement has become part of our life [np3,2-] , and our society cannot develop without   advertisement. Tax amnesty is a way the U. S government use [vp3,4-]  to encourage tax evaders to pay up their tax by promising no penalty. Although it helped the government [vp2,3-3]  raise tax revenues after  it was carried out, it still cannot [vp6, 2-] prove  [vp7,4-2]  to be  entire success [np2,2-] . it [fm3,-]  left problems. If it was carried out in China , it will take [wd3,1-2]effect. Amnesty means no punishment if you do according to the government. However, why do those truants evade tax [np3,1-] [sn2,s-]  . [sn9,-]  Do they save the money only to pay when a tax amnesty comes? f course not. Many of the tax heaters do not pay for their tax [np3,3-]  because they think they can free themselves from axes by not paying the money without being discovered. If the government cannot discover them, it [pr1,S-S]  still cannot do it against an amnesty. The tax amnesty cannot get all the tax evaders to pay up. Only a small part [wd3,2-2]  of them, who feel guilty, will pay up. If the government cannot find out and punish the other big part [wd3,3-] after the amnesty, the converts [wd7, 1-]  will feel unfair. And then they will evade tax again. Finally [cj1, -S] , the amnesty will become meaningless. Beside  [fm1,-] , in hope of another amnesty in the future tax collection [sn2, s-s]  ore difficult. Some people suggest that China can also offer [wd3,-] a tax-amnesty program to raise the tax revenues. The government, however, will not do that. Because the tax system in China is different from the U. S tax system [sn6,S-] . Take the personal income tax for example, in China, the income tax that an employee should pay is deducted from his salary before the company give [vp3,3-]  the rest to him. In this case, the chance for the employee to evade the income tax is very small. Then  a tax amnesty may mean nothing to them. In short, tax-amnesty can work for raising tax revenues, but it is not a perfect program. And it is not so suitable for China. Having a TV [vp2,3-]  gives you a lot. It can provides you with the latest news and information, broaden your outlook [wd3,3-] , teach you many things, bring you relaxation, entertainment and excellent recreation. Nowadays, would [fm1,-]  information is getting more and more important to peoples [np4,-1]  life  [np3,1-1]  . But it change   [vp3,2-]  so quickly that books and newspapers  sometimes can not catch up with it. If you want to get the latest information, a TV can help you. As long as you sit in front of the TV, you can get a piece of news the minute it comes in . And you can also find out many [np8,2-1]  information of finance and economics [fm1,-] which is very helpful to your business and investment. And there are all kinds of advertisements shown on TV, so you can know more about the goods in the market, especially the new products. Watching TV is a good way to widen your field of vision [np2,4-]  and [sn8,s] for you to learn more. The world is so big and you have so little time. What you learn from school and book is limited. TV is [wd4,2-2]   good teacher. You can know about the world even without going out of your house. There are programs reflecting social problems. Watch it and you will get familiar with the society. If you are interested in cooking, you can watch the cooking program, and then cook the flavor dishes. And the  children's program [np3,3-]  can teach children many thing  [np3,2-]  in [wd4,1-2]  lively way. And TV is also good for exchanging different culture  [np3,2-]  in different parts of the world. Some programs introduce special animals, plants, customs of other countries, and also beautiful scenery in the world. So you don't need to take much time and money to travel to learn these things.And you can learn foreign languages by watch [vp5,1-5]   the programs in foreign languages. Besides, watch [vp5,16-] TV can also bring you relaxation, entertainment and excellent recreation. After a long time of work, you want something to relax you [pr4,2-]  and entertain you [pr4,2-] . Suppose [vp7,1s-]  that you're very tired and you don't want to go outing [vp2,2-2]  for entertainment. [sn9,-]  Just stay at home and watch TV. Perhaps there are programs you're interested in. And that  [wd7,2-]  you solve the problem. Watching TV can also help you to kill the time if you have any extra  [wd4,1-]  on your hand. Old people will not feel alone  [wd3,2-]  and young children  will not feel bored if they enjoy the TV programs. TVs [np5,1-]  is necessary to us. Sitting in front of the TV [wd4,-5]perhaps know the whole world. Nowadays people have all kinds of sports to keep health [vp2,2-]. In my opinion, there is no sport better than swimming. I began to learn swimming when I was only three years old. I soon found it is [vp6,3-]  the best kind of sport and it suit [vp6,s-] me well. I used to be very weak and I could not bear the sports costing a lot of energy. [sn9,-]  such as running and playing balls. Compared with other kind [np3,2-2]  of sports, swimming is no[wd3,-] tiring [wd3,3-] . On the contrary, it can make me fresh [fm1,-]  and become stronger and stronger. Whenever I am in the water, I forget everything. the[fm3,-] water is so soft that it makes me totally relaxed. Besides swimming is the only sport I can master well. I am a good swimmer. This makes me feel confident in the swimming pool and anywhere [ad1,-3] I can swim. Swimming is a good sport. Being good at swimming, I can go anywhere in the water. If you  [wd4,1-1] tired and do not feel well, why not try to swim? Birth  control is a basic policy in China. It is really necessary and suitable for the country because  to support such a lot of people is too hard [wd3,9-3]  for it and its people. Some people think that birth control is [wd4, 3-5]  kind of interfering[wd3,-2] human rights, and it is not reasonable to prevent a couple from giving birth to more babies. However, the resources and materials that support people's lives in a country are limited. If there are too many people in the country, the things that each person get [vp3,3-] will not be sufficient. Then many people will starve or lack things they should have. In [pp2,-2] other word, if a couple give [vp3,3-2] birth to one more baby, in a country with more than 1. 2 billion citizens , they  [pr3,s-]  will interfere a person's right [fm1,-]  to live and many people's rights to improve the level of their lives [wd3,5-] .  [wd4, -s] Big population is an obstacle to a developing country like China. Therefore, birth control is a way to help our country to develop more fast and become more and more prosperous. There is an old saying in Chinese that it is easier for you to get a large sum of money than to get a real friend. Everybody needs friends. Friendship is more valuable than any thing  [wd3,2-]  else. With the development of the commerce, money  has become more and more important to people. Many people regard money as the only big purpose of their lives. Therefore, the relationship between person and person has become indifferent. Friendship is measured by money. The more rich a person is, the more "friends" he has. However, his kind of friends are not real friends at all. :A friend in need is a friend indeed. " A real friend will concern  [vp7,2-2]  about you and give you a hand when you are in trouble without asking for reward. he [fm3,-]  can share your happiness and sadness. it's [fm3,-]  not easy for a person to find such kind of friend even if he has a lot of money. Friendship should be cherished by everyone who has it. A person who has no friend does not live [vp1, 5-]  a real and happy life, because he cannot get the most important thing in the world. There are many public facilities in a society. Among the public facilities, library [np6,2-]  is an important part because it provide  [vp3,2-]  a chance for people to read more and know more. Some people think that if they want to read a book, they can just buy it from the shop or borrow [wd4,1-1]  from others. There is no need to go to a library. However, not everyone can afford all the books he wants to read. if [fm3,-]  a poor student needs to read an expensive book [pr5,10-5]  none of his friends have, the only place that he can turn to is the library. Besides, not all the books can be bought in  [np6,1-1] bookshops. , [sn9,-] for  [fm3,-] example, some books that were published a long time ago and would not be published any more. [sn9,-]   [wd4,-1]  We may just find these rare editions in a library. Therefore, library has all kinds of books that is needed by many people. Its status in the society can not be replaced by any other things. Christmas is a big holiday in many countries. Although some people  may argue that Christmas should be a National Holiday in China too, it is impossible to become reality. Because different country [np3,1-1]  has different culture [np3,1-1] . China has its own customs and traditions including traditional holidays. Christmas is not an international holiday for the whole world to celebrate. It is originally a religious holiday, a yearly celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ. It became a national holiday in many western countries because a large part of their populations were Christian to whom Christmas was the biggest celebration in a year. They celebrated Christmas in their traditional way. By and by the Christmas celebration became part of the countries [np2, 1-1]  culture. Other people who are not Christian also enjoy the day. Therefore it became a big holiday of [pp1,1-3]  the whole country. However, inChina people who believe in the Christian religion are only a very small group, compared with the great [wd3,4-1]  population. Many people, especially the olders   [fm1,-], even don't know what Christian [fm1,-]  is. How can Christian [fm1,-] be a national holiday without many natives knowing it? Choristers [fm1,-]  has a long history in the West, but in China e know it just as a part of foreign culture which came into our country not long ago. It makes no sense to most of the Chinese people. China is a country with a history of thousands of years. From generation to generation, the Chinese nation has formed its own culture with distinctive feature  [np3,3-] . We also have our own holidays to celebrate. For example, the Spring Festival, the biggest traditional holiday to [wd3,-] Chinese people [sn9,-]  which [pr1,-]reflects [vp3,-]the Chinese feature [np3,3-]  and is also a part of our own culture. Christmas [sn9,-]  as a world famous day and an important day to the Christian, can be celebrated in China by the common people if they like, but it won't be a national holiday in China just as the Spring Festival won't be a national holiday in U. S. A. To sum up, there are different customs and traditions in different places. It is ot acceptable to put a typical culture of one country to another, ignoring the regional contrast. In conclusion, Christmas should not be a national holiday in China.    Nowadays there are more and more cars, and everyday [sn9,-]  hundreds of thousands of cars are running in different parts of the worlds. Even in  [np6,12-] small campus, there are cars running. Some people may think it convenient to let cars run in the campus. However, car should not be allowed in the campus because it causes pollution, accident [np6,1-]  and many other problems that have very bad effect on both the campus and the people in the campus. Campus is a place for students to study, but not a place for transportation. What we need is a clean and quiet environment which is suitable for our study. cars running in the campus will bring toxic gas and noise as well as a large amount of dust. The toxic gas produced by cars will polluted the air of [pp1,3-2]  the campus. Students inhaling this kind of gas will easily suffer from it, or even get respiratory diseases. The noise made by the running cars and the sudden  brakes spoil the tranquil [fm1,-]  environment. It's also a kind of pollution. Apart from causing pollution, many car [np3,2-]  running in the campus will make the school life disorderly and cause accidents. Campus is just a small place with many teachers and students in it.They are scatted [fm1,-]  here and there in the campus, enjoying their teaching , studying, playing games or just walking along the mall path. If cars are allowed in  [np6,1-1] campus, teaching and studying will be disturbed by the annoying noise of the running cars. Students will have less place to play games and do physical exercise [sn9,-]  for many cars park in the campus. When you are walking along the path and talking to your friends, you have to worry about the possibility of being knocked down by a running car, and of course, you will find it difficult to make yourself heard because of the noise. If there is an accident, many peel [wd7,1-]  will be involved. In our university, there are many accidents caused by running cars. Once a teacher of our department had a car accident when he was riding a bicycle to the classroom. The car knocked him down and hurt his arm. he had to go to the hospital and could not give his lecture to the class. he suffered a lot from the accident, so did the students of the class he taught. Cars running in campus will not only make the campus very dirty but also do harm to the teachers' and student [np4,1-1]  health and disturb their normal life [np3,3-] . Therefore, cars should not be allowed in campus.  Bicycle theft is very common  on [wd4,-] campus and his means [wd7,2-]  is very high. When you leave your bicycle for a few minutes, specially [wd3,1-]  [np6,-2]  brand-new bicycles, you will find that your bicycle has already gone. When students are having a class, they couldn't help thinking about whether their bicycles have gone or not. 	But who is [np6,-2]  bicycle theft,  [np6,-2] college student or a labourer working on a public project? we don't know. The means [wd7,1-]  of theft bicycle [cc1,2-]  is so high that they do not leave any trace. The police do not mind the bicycle theft because the losing of bicycle is a common sight. They said that losing a bicycle equals [vp2,1-3]  losing an egg. 	Since bicycle can be easily stolen, Can it be bought cheap [ad2,4-] ? Yes, it can. A half-new [fm1,- ] bicycle costs about 80 yuan. To our surprise, we buy this second-hand  bicycle from  [np6,-6] students who are in other college [np3, 2-] . Can we say that those college [np3,2-] [wd4,-1]  are bicycle theft? Of course not, they are only act as the function of medium [fm1,-]  and it seems that it is also "a job". They can receive certain[wd3,-1] money from  [np6,-1] buyer and seller [np6,1-] . But there are not many students doing this "job". 	If all of us do not buy second-hand bicycle, what will happen? Maybe bicycle theft will [sn8,s]  out of business. But it is difficult for us to do so, we haven't so much [wd4,2-1]  to buy a new bicycle. So when we buy a second-hand bicycle we must accept the fact that buying a bicycle equals [vp2,1-3]  renting [vp5,2-]  a bicycle.  	Nowadays studying abroad is very popular among young people. In order to get the chance to study abroad, they make every effort to study English well. Is studying abroad good or not? In[pp2,-2] my personal opinion, it has more positive effect [np3,3-]  than negative effect [np3,2-]. There are two reasons for this. 	First, studying abroad can further improve your foreign language. When you go into another country, you will be forced to speak to [np6,-2]  native speakers. In this way, you can speak your foreign language as well as the native speakers. 	Second, you can learn something from another country. You study abroad not only to improve your foreign language.[sn,s]. But the most important of all is that you can learn some advanced technology. Then you can introduce these [np5,1-] technology to your motherland. At present, our country is a developing country. She needs science and technology. After [pp1,1- 3]  you come back, you will be a talent [wd2,2-1] person to our country. 	Of course, there are few [wd3,1-] people who study abroad and are not willing to come back. This may make [np6,-1] Chinese be shame [wd2,2- 2] of them. In all, studying abroad has more positive effect [np3,2-] than negative effect [wd6,1-]  [np3,2-].  	Since the policy of opening to the world was enforced [wd3,7-] ,  the appearance of China has changed a lot. Guangzhou is a good example. Now if you set foot on Guangzhou soil, you will find that its urban development is so rapid that you hardly recognize it. 	People who have been to GZ before are very  [wd4,-1] that the houses in the past were old and short. Some of them are even made of wood so [sn9,-] fire often causes many people [vp2,3-1] homeless. But now [sn9,-]  things are different. large [wd3,1-] construction [np3,2-] can be seen everywhere especially in some new[ad2,1-2]  developing districts such as Tianhe. [sn9,-] Baiyun. In these districts there are all kinds of buildings. They are not only high but [cj2,4-2]  gorgeous. Furthermore, the speed of building a house is very surprising. Of these buildings Zhongtian Building in Tianhe district is the highest which [sn8,s] has 64 floors. These new districts are built so well that nobody can believe that they were bleak and desolate some years ago. Besides [sn9,-] construction [np3,2-] , transportation [sn8,s]  also develops [vp6,s-] rapidly. GZ has a large population [sn9,-]  so urban traffic is always a serious problem. In the past, when people went to work or were [vp2,-4] out of work, the roads were always packed with people. That wasted people's time and lowered their working efficiency. In order to ase [fm1,-]  that Problem,  [np6,- 1] government has built many roads, [wd4,1-1]  bridges. Large vioducts     [fm1,-] are common in GZ now. They risscross [fm1,-] and connect many parts of places. At the same time the tunnel in the river has been dredged. It is so convenient that people need  [sn8,s] not only depend on ferryboats to cross a river and have another choice. When [np6,- 1] subway is used in August, 1997,traffic in GZ will be [vp2,1-3] better and better. In addition [sn9,-]  people's living [np2,2-5]  has been changed a lot. In the past the division of products was fixed. It made people [vp2,2-4]  live a hard life. But after [np6,1-1]  reform, in pace with the rapid economic development, standard of people's living [wd3,4-]  is raised. Now we have a good assortment of goods. They are good and their prices are resonable [fm1,-] so the customers have many choices. Besides food, dresses, [sn9,1-]  entertainment is [vp3,3-] also important. There are many kinds of entertainment in GZ, so people's life [np3,2-]  is [vp3,3-]  colourful. Now most of  [np6,-1] people needn't worry about food, address [np3,1-][fm1,-]. Some of them are even well-to-do. 	Generally speaking, GZ [np4,1-2]  rapid development is owing to [np6,-3]  government's right policies. Looking from its development, Guangzhou,  [np6,1- 4] capital of Guangdong province, will become an international city very soon.  	In university, bicycles are students' and teachers' favorites. because since [cj1,2-]  the campus is so large, the bicycles can offer [wd3,1-2]  many [np8,1-1]  conveniences [np5,2-]  to them. But now, one thing troubling them is that their bikes are stolen so easily that they have bought many bikes. Therefor, bicycle theft on campus should arouse our attentions. 	In order to find the good way to prevent this thing [pr2,2-]  effectively, we must analyze who is the thieves first. Generally speaking, there are two kinds of thieves. One is from outside [np6,1-1]  school. There are many bicycles on campus n1,s-]  and [np6,1-1]  campus is often quiet [sn1,s-]  especially when we have lessons [vp2,2-] so the thieves outside avert [wd7, 5-]  their attentions to the campus. [sn1,s]There is still the other kind of thieves although they re not many. They come [vp3,1-1]  from students. Maybe some students spend their money extravagantly or their families are poor so when they lack [vp1,1-2]of money, they steal bikes. [sn1,s] Under the circumstances, the most important thing to prevent this crime is  [vp5,9-7] tightening up the security of the school. The security men [wd3,3-]  should make their rounds [vp2,3-1]  often and make the thieves have no chance to steal the bicycles. Furthermore, the owners of the bikes [wd4,5-6]  pay attention to their bike's security [cc1,-]. Maybe they can buy two keys [wd3,3-4]  to lock their bikes and lay [wd3,1-5]  them in the busy places. Nevertheless, for the thieves from students, moral education is the most effective way.  After making them know how wrong they are [cc4,7-] ,it's possible for some people to give up doing this kinds of thing. 	Now, bicycle theft is not only ordinary [wd3,6-2]  on campus, it is also ordinary [wd3,4-3]  in the society so it is a serious problem. [sn1,s]However, if we pay more attention to the people's moral education and crack down on this crime firmly, it can be believed [wd3,4-0]  that bicycle theft will become less and less. 	Of all the sports, my favourit [fm1,-] sport is table tennis. Table-tennis has been my friend since I was in primary school. I like it for two reasons. . 	First, it can strength [wd2,3-2]  my body. Playing table tennis is one of the efficient way [np3,4-0] to strength [wd2,1-2] people's bodies. It needs fast running and the other [wd5,1-6]  cooperation of all parts of body. After playing table-tennis, you will be wet through and at this time you'll realize that you have been trained ficerely  [fm1,-]. Second [wd3,-1] , it is good to [pp1,3-1]  [wd4,-1]  eye. We all know that play [vp5,3-7] table-tennis needs the reaction of the eyes. It takes very short time for the eyes to react [vp2,s-3] the coming ball. If we often play table-tennis, we can keep our eyesight and the eye reaction [cc1,2-] to things. I also saw many articles talk these about [vp2,2-3]  playing table tennis. 	I will continue to play table -tennis and never stop because  I benefit a lot from it.  	It is known that we couldn't [vp6,5-2] be invisible. But let's  imagine [vp7,2-4]  what I would do If I were invisible. I would do main [wd3,-] things. 	First, I would do good deeds for the people. In  [np6, 1-3] Chinese folk story there was a monk who had magic always helped the poor. He got [wd3,1-4]  money from the rich and gave them [pr3,7-3] to the poor. If I were invisible, I would do what the monk did [vp6,6-]  and punish those who are guilty of all kinds of evil[wd3,s-]. Second [wd3,1-]  I would help the policemen  [vp2,3-3] solve a case. Being invisible is very helpful to the policemen. I could follow the suspicion and give the information about him to the policemen. Especially I could help the policemen [vp2,3-4]  solve a big case which would make [wd3, 2-2]  them headache . 	If I were invisible, I would not do sth [fm1,-]  to the prejudice of our society [wd7,8-]. I'll try my best to help people who are kindhearted and honest.  	It would be wonderful if I were invisible. 	I could do many things which I can't do right now. My life would be definitely different. 	I could realize my dreams easily. I hope I can travel [vp1,-5]many places as I can, but that needs a lot of money. If I were invisible, I could travel without paying anything [wd3,5-]  and I could visit some important persons without being seen. Also, I could help the police [vp2,4-2]  catch criminals if I were invisible and help to guard the security and peace of the society. I could do good deeds for people easily. If I were invisible, I would not have to take so many boring examination [np3,2-] and I could learn things I want without considering other faclors [fm1,-]. 	In one word, if I were invisible, I would do many things I always dream [vp6,2-1]  of. But I know that is impossible because I am visible.  	 Population[np6,-8]  is a serious problem in the world now. some people said that maybe people would not have enough place to live in the earth in the next century if it [pr1,s-4] goes on increasing rapidly. Under this condition[wd3,2-] , birth control becomes very necessary because it is very important to the country's development and people's lives. 	First, birth control is good for the economy of a country. If a country has a large population, that means he [pr3,9-4] must offer more food, clothes and consuming [np2,1-1] goods to us inhabitants than other countries. In that case, it is very difficult for this country to satisfy [np6,2-2]  people's need and rapid development [,s-s]  becomes more difficult. Second [wd3,1-] , birth control is also important to the resources in the world. If there are too many people in a country, they need more resources.  But the resources in the world is [vp5, 1-]limited. Therefore, isn't it very necessary for a country to control birth [wd4,2-]? [wd4,s-s]  birth control is helpful to increase people's educational level. More people means more illiterates in the country because there are not enough teachers and schools.	Generally speaking, in order to beautify the world, make the country develop rapidly and make people live [vp1,1-3]  a better life, we must control the birth. Let's work hard for it!      Nowadays, more and more people long for [vp6,6-5]  the chance to study abroad. In my opinion, studying abroad has both advantage and disadvantage.      First, studying abroad can gain more experiences. We have to do some part- time job as we study in order to afford the high tuition [fm1,-]  and expenses. In this way, we [wd4,4-4]  get many work experiences. In the second place [pp2,3-], studying in the developed countries, we can use modern equiments [fm1,-] which our country can not provide for us [sn9,-]  And the study atmosphere abroad encourages us to obtain more knowledge o that  we can study future [vp2,4-3]  in our field. Finally, by studying abroad, we can make greater contributions to our motherland's socialist construction in the near future.      However, each advantage has its disadvantage. Some people go abroad to study in the hope that they may get quick promotion. So they don't study hard and just get a smattering [wd2,3-2]  of knowledge. Moreover, some evil aspects abroad may have effects on their morality.      In my opinion, studying abroad can do us any good if we nouish [fm1,-] the love  for our country.       Nowadays [sn9,-]  more and more people are going abroad to get further study. From most the researches, Chinese people have the tendency to study in  [np6,1-2]  developed countries, such as U. S. A. ,U. K, Japan and so forth. My view on  studying abroad is that it is not only a convenient way for us to learn the  different cultures but also a way to learn what we lack in our country, for instance, the modern technology.      With the development of the world, the connection with their countries is  getting more important. If we don't know what the other countries' culture like, we would make mistakes and be in  [np7,1-2] embarrassing situation when we communicate with each other. So during your stay [wd2,2-1]  abroad, you can get familiar with others.      Knowledge is boundless, studying abroad can help us [vp2, 1-7]  know what is the most modernized things. [sn9,-]  and enrich our mind. Studying abroad also can help us [vp2,1-6]  know the different ideas of life, thought, politics and so on.      In my opinion, studying abroad is attractive and challenging. It helps you [vp2,3-2]  know more and learn more from other countries.       Nowadays it seems to be very popular to study abroad. In my view, it's a good chance to gain more knowledge and experience.      First of all, when you study abroad, you can master the foreign language  quite easily and quickly. While studying make you use the foreign language all the time [sn2,s-] . Secondly, it can open your eye [np3,2-] . In a foreign country, you have more chances to contact [vp1,2-2]  different people, different culture and customs. So long as you study hard, you can absorb the knowledge as much as you can. When you return to your own country [sn9,-] you can make full use of other countries' advanced technology and knowledge and do devotion [cc3,1-] to the country. Thirdly, when you make friends with other foreigners, you can also exchange your different opinions and make each other know the other's country's culture. Such communication is as a bridge between countries, establishing friendship between [wd4,1-1]  peoples.      Above all, studying abroad is a good opportunity and an adventure for you to challenge [vp1,s-] . Once the chance comes to you, you'd better treasure it.  	In recent years, it's very popular that many graduates go abroad to continue their study. I also dream to [vp2,1-5]  have this chance one day. Studying abroad is a good opportunity to learn more knowledge.      Our motherland is still a developing country, [sn9,-]  in many science field, we are not as good as some Westen [fm1,-] countries. If we have the chance to study abroad, we can learn much advanced techniques. When we come back, we can use these knowledges [np5,1-] in our practical work. But there are also some persons who don't want to come back to [np6,3-1]  motherland after finishing their study abroad. They want to have the food [sn9,-]  work condition and life condition they can't have at home.      Studying Abroad is many young people's dream, [sn9,-]  however, not many people's dream can come true. Those who have this chance should treasure it. Since the 1980's many people have gone abroad or further Study[fm3,-], among them some are sent by the country.[sn1,s] In [pp2,-2] my viewpoint, studying abroad is exciting, meaningful but challenging at the same time.      People who have the chance to study abroad are offered d3,16-]  the technology from the developed country, and that really broadens their horizon [np2,2-] . At the same time, our country can benefit from it a lot [wd1,5-] . Although not everyone studying abroad return [vp3,4-1]  home, those who  have finished their studying and come back do make great contributions to our country's modernization construction. But people who plan to go abroad for further study should prepare themselves for the hardship. They will be confronted with many difficulties, such as language barriers and totally different life patterns.      In short, studying abroad is a golden chance to open your eyes and learn more, and it's also a worth while [fm1,-]  opportunity to train your adaptability [vp2,2-] .  Nowadays many people went abroad and studies [vp3,5-]  in the other [wd3,1-]  countries, and  this has become a social focus. I think, as other things in the world, [sn4,s-s]  studying abroad has its two sides.      First, we must admit that studying abroad has great advantages. Actually some aspects of education in some countries are  better than that in our motherland. If we can study there, it'll help us [vp2,2-2]  learn more and better. Especially to [np6,1-3]  foreign languages majors, if they can learn the language among the natives, they can pay half while get twice. But, we all know that going abroad costs a lot of money. And if you're going to study there, you can't find a full-time job and sometimes you can hardly find a part-time job because you're a foreigner. So the life is hard to support [vp1,1-] . And then you can hardly devote [wd4,-] to your study. And the result will not be the expected one.      So, in my opinion, it's a good thing for us to studying [vp2,7-1]  abroad if we 're rich enough. But if we really cannot afford it, studying in our homeland will be better.  	As we have more and more economic and casual communication with other countries, we need to know more about the economy, culture and life  of them. So I think studying broad is a good way to achieve this purpose.      Generally speaking in many developed countries, especially [sn6,s-s]  West Europe, America, Japan, [np6,-9]  economy and education science has been developed very well, [sn9,-]  so studying abroad can provide [vp1,1-4]  us a good  opportunity to study further in all kinds of fields. What's more, it can expand our eye-scope. We can learn [wd4,1-4]  about the foreign countries --- the way the people live [vp1,4-] , the famous places , customs, culture etc. We can learn more from our own experience of studying  abroad than from [sn6,s-5]  books or just from travel. And last [cj1,1-s] , studying abroad is a kind of independent [wd2,3-] . When we study abroad, we'll have to take care of ourselves and adapt ourselves to the entirely new environment. So it can harden our mind [vp2,2-] .      All in all, Studying abroad is a once-in-a-life [fm1,-] chance, [sn9,-]  if [fm3,-]  we have the chance we shall [vp9, s-2]  seize it. Nowadays, more and more students want to go abroad to study, and I am not the exception. Because studying abroad will really be a good chance for us to learn more.      First, we can improve our oral English quickly. The people around us are all native speakers, we'll contact with them everyday. When we talk with them or listen to them, our spoken English will become nearer to native English. Second [wd3,1-2] , There are many differences between [np6,1-5]  exotic culture and Chinese culture. . Studying abroad can help us to experience the differences, and enrich our knowledge from it. Last but not least, we'll be a more mature person. Because studying abroad means that we have to depend on ourselves. In addition to study, we must learn to earn money to support our expensive tuition's [np4,3-3]  and our lives. independence  will bring maturity to us, and that's indispensable.     Above all, studying abroad will help us a lot. If you have the chance, you'd better not miss it.  	In my opinion, studying abroad is a good thing that we can benefit a lot from. While studying abroad, we will  contact with many people from different countries. Then we can know their respective customes [fm1,-] and viewpoints under [wd3,-]different political systems. Besides [cj2,-2] for this, we can widen our eyescope  [fm1,-] by visiting their typical buildings, museums and well as [cj2,2-2]  natural preserves during vacations. What's more, studying in [np6,1-2]  English-speaking countries is [np7,4-4]  rare chance for those who major in learning English. If you practice English daily, your English, spoken and written, will improve rapidly. And the most important is that we can learn their advanced knowledge and use it to serve our own people and country.      In short, the advantages [sn8,s]  that studying abroad brings will benefit [vp2,2-5]  you all of your life.  	If I am [vp8,2-3]  given a chance to study abroad, I will not [vp8,3-2]  miss it. [sn9,-]  Because I think studying abroad will help me a lot.      First, I major in a [np7,2-2]  foreign language. If I want to improve my study, the most important thing is to have more chance to talk with foreigner. So if I study abroad, all the people around me will help me in my study.      Second [wd3,1-] , our country is an undeveloped country, while some other western countries are developed counties. I think during the period of studying abroad, we can get some information on the political and economic policits [fm1,-] of [np2,9-3]  the western countries or in which way the people manage their companies. After I come back, I can pick up the useful things I have learned abroad to develop our country.      I short, I love my study, my life and my country. If I can study abroad, I'll try my best to learn things which can help me a lot in my contribution to my motherland.  	With the development of economy and the implement of the open-door-policy [fm1,-] , the eyesights [fm1,-] of the Chinese have been broadened. Nowadays, it's quite common and easy for people, especially the youth, to study abroad. But everything has its two side [np3,2-] . about [fm3,-]  going abroad, here [wd3,1-6]  is [vp3,1-6]   [np6,-6] positive as well as [np6,-2]  negative side [np3,6-] .      The construction of [np6,3-5]  four modernization in our country demands a great number of talented people as they play a key role in science, technology, economy and many other fields. By going abroad for further study, people can  learn , see many new things which can't be seen in their own country, [sn9,-]  and [fm3,-]  once they come back home, they bring with them various skills, experience and make great contribution to the country. By studying in the countries where great achievements have been made in science and technology, we save our time and money in our research and we can say it's really a shortcut to develop our own science and technology. And for those who are learning foreign languages, going abroad will give them a genuine [wd3,1-2]  language atmosphere, their speech will be more native. Nevertheless, every light has its shadow. Studying abroad also cause [vp3,3-4]  some serious problem [np2,2-] . That is, many people wouldn't like to go back home after their study. We must know that among people who study abroad, most of them are financed by the country or their own unit [np3,2-] . They financed them because they want them to use [wd3,1-9]  their knowledge they learned abroad to contribute to them. Once they stay abroad, there will be a great loss of money. Many people don't want to go back just because they like staying in a more developed country, paying no attention to the backward situation in their own country.      In short, [np6,-4]  talented people's studying abroad can bring great benefit to the country and people themselves, but if they forget their original intention of the study only for their own interest [np3,2-] , they should be blamed!       In China, thousands of students rush to study abroad each year. Studying abroad has both advantages and disadvantages.  	At its best [pp2,2-] , overseas students who come back with hornors [fm1,-] do great contributions to our country. Universities abroad provide them with [np7,1-3]  excellent study environment, advanced equipments and qualified teachers. In general, there universities stress on a combination of theory and practice. Students can apply what they've learned to practical use. Whereas in China, practice seems to be cut from theories. Overseas Students are given a better education by studying abroad.      On the other hand, it's no [vp2,2-4]  easy job to study abroad. Most of the students take part-time jobs to pay the tuition. Hard work spoil [vp3,2- 4]  both their health and studies. What's worse [sn9,-]  some students refuse to come back to the motherland due to the temptation of high wages and good jobs. [sn1,s]     We should encourage students to study abroad as it helps us [vp2,2-5]  pace up with the world. Students are there in touch with the largest [wd3,4-1]  development. But at the same time we should prevent the outflow of talents [np5,3-] .  	In recent years, many people want to study abroad. and whether it is good or not has raised a great deal of heated discussion. According to me I think it all depends. Let me develop it by two points.      The purpose of studying abroad are quite different according to different  kinds of people. I think it is good if you want to go abroad to learn more [vp2,2-6]  what ourcountry hasn't developed yet, such as some highly modernized science and technique and applied [sn8,s-]  to our production. [sn9,-]  Or some scholars go to abroad [vp2,3-2]  for communication and for introducing some new ideas, its also worthwhile. But there are some people who go to abroad [vp2,3-0] just because studying abroad is a fashion or just [sn6,9-5]  want to get a diplomat. Actually, this kind of people don't really want to learn something and surely they are not likely to grasp [wd3,1-1]  much. Because the expense of studying abroad is a large sum of money and they learn nothing, undoubtedly it's a great loss.      All in all, I hold the opinion if there is real need to study abroad, do it with your every effort. If not, save your money and save your time.  	Nowadays, many people want to go abroad to study. But some  people think it is a kind of betray to our country's civilization and culture. They even think that going abroad to study is an excuse for wanting to live in a more prosperous foreign country. I contend quite blundly [fm1,-], that to study abroad isn't an act of betray but of hunting [sn6,11- 2]  for knowledge.      Admittedly [cj1,1-] , our country has a long history of civilization which has a great influence on the people all over the world. But different country has different civilization. Is it just enough for us to learn our own civilization and history? No, never! A person who really wants to study would want to learn something about the civilization in other countries. And the best way to learn them [pr3,s-6]  is to go abroad to study/ [sn9,-]  Secondly, we should admit that some developed countries have an advantage over us in technology and science. We should go aboard to study instead of closing our country's gate and going on our own way --- which is not a wise way to develop our country.      In short, studying abroad can enlarge one's knowledge and, to some extent, help develop one's own country. 

<ST 5> <SEX 2> <y 10> <SCH WSD> <AGE 20> <WAY 3><DIC 1> <TYP 1> Friendship is very important for everyone whoever he or she might be, poor men or rich men, the single or the married, Children or adults. Real friendship is worth its weight in gold. It's value is great. 	Have you heard the greatest friendship between Karl Marx and angles [fm1,-] [fm3,-]  ? They began their friendship in 1842 and be[vp6,-1]   friends until Marx died. During that years they helped each other, overcame much hardship, and finished the well-known works [np3,2-2]  ---<<Communist Declaration>>. It's [vp6,s-4]  their sincere friendship that encourage [vp6,1-4]  them to work together. So, you can see, real friendship is valuable when you are in trouble. Your good friends will give you a hand, and you won't be lonely because you have friends. 	Furthermore, friendship do [vp3,1-] make your life colorful as you can share your happiness with friends. After class or on holidays, you may go out to play together or travell [fm1,-] in a beautiful place. Relaxing with friends [sn2, 3- 4]  you feel more interested. 	Anything [wd7,-] you couldn't live without a friend. There is a Chinese saying: You rely on your parents at home and depend on our [pr3,10- 2]  friends outside. friendship is valuable indeed.  	Nowadays advertisements become more and more popular. They can often be seen in a newspaper or on TV. Advertisement has its advantages and disadvantages, [sn9,-]  however [fm3,-] , it does play an important role in our lives. 	We can get information from advertisement before making our decision to buy something. This is the main advantage to us. Advertisement makes products known by public and promotes selling them. SO it's important for manufacturer [np3,3-] [sn8,s]  . And it's also a vital part in newspaper. No one can run a newspaper without its supports [np5,3-] . On the other hand, advertisement is not so reliable as they seems [vp3,1-2]  to be. Sometimes it didn't [vp6,2-4]  give the real information but exaggerated [vp6,1-1]  one. It's always tempting [wd2,2-4]  to attract the customers. Many people found they had been treated[wd3,-] after they bought something following the advertisement.  	Electricity is [wd4,2-2]  essential power. The world could not do without it. 	Electricity can produce light, heat and drive machines. It makes our life more convenient. It drives the machines to produce food, clothes and so  on. Without these basic material [np3,2-] , we can [wd7,5-4]  live in the world. People use electricity to produce light. With light, we can see everything clear in the dark. We don't use candles any more. And we watch TV, listen to the radio, use washing machine and refrigerator. Here is a story: After the famous inventor Edison died, the American government decided to cut off the electric power for three minute [np3,2-] . But finally they didn't do it. Because electricity is so important. [sn2,s] 	We could not do with electricity. It provides so many things for us.  	Paper is an invention the world [sn8,s]  could not do without. It plays an important role no matter  [,s-s] in the ancient times or in modern society. 	Long long ago, there was no paper. People had to write on bamboo. About [wd4,1-3]  the Hang Danesty [fm1,-], the clever Chinese first invented paper. It was poch-making [wd7,2-6]  in the history of human culture, and it became one of the four greatest inventions in ancient China. TO day [fm1,-] , with the development of society, paper is used extensively. You can see paper everywhere, newspaper, magazine, book, post . . . . . . and you can learn a lot from them. How can we imagine the world without paper? It's a sign of human civilization. It brings so much convenience to us. It is a [fm1,-]  necessity of our life.   	If  I asked a thousand people a question that what kind of invention the world wouldn't do without. [sn9,-]  I bet a thousand people will answer "Electricity. " Yes indeed, without electricity, the factory can't work, [sn9,-]  without it, we'll live in [wd4,-] dark at night without a single light. [sn9,-] without it, we can't do anything. 	Nowaday [fm1,-], many machine and appliance are used [vp7,5-3]  electricity as power, the factory depend [vp3,2-5]  on the working of machine and the housewife do housework rely [vp5,55-] on the working of appliance. We'll feel very hot if we haven't the fan or air-conditioner. The patient can't have an operation or check due to [np6,2-3]  lack of electricity. Beside [cj1,1-] . [sn9,-] TV have become part of our life [np3,3-] , and broadcasting too [sn8,s] . How people can do without it. [sn9, -]  	Lack of electricity is horrible. you can't imagine it cause [fm1,-]  it's become part of our life [np3, 3-]  too. It's reported that  in order to mourn for the inventing kind [wd7,1-] the invernter  [fm1,-] of electricity Adison. America once decided to stop using lectricity [fm1,-]  for 5 minutes during the mourning. But soon unceled  [fm1,-] it because most of people [np2,3-3]  were against it. They saw the importance f electricity. Even lack of it for a minute it will be a great loss.[sn8,s-]  	An invention the world could not do without is [sn2,s-]  ---well. [sn9,-]  Since it came into existence, people no longer had to stay at a limited area all their life [np3,2-] . They can exchange goods with [sn6,s-2]  other places. Science and technology was encouraged. 	Wheel, our round-faced friend, has made much contribution to human beings. Wherever he rolls, he brings material and mental wealth there. After he was invented, people used them to make wheelbarrow. Then it became part of bicycle [np6,4-] , car and train. And now, he is also an important element of plane. Thus, either goods or people can be carried to other places of [wd3,3-2]  the world, even culture and knowledge can be spread out. 	Without him, can we live a richer life, can we promote economic prosperity [np2,3-] , can we develop science and technology? Completely impossible! Wheel, the big bridge, connects different areas on the earth together to form a real world, a [fm1,-]  unified world!  	Since the telephone invented, it has been used all over the world. People use them to keep contacted [wd2,1-] [vp2,2-]  , inform [vp5,3-2]  emergency [wd2,-1]  information, do [vp5,-1]  business.. . . and so on. 	In modern society, our daily rhythm is so fast that we don't have so much time to call in our good friends and relatives. A telephone can send our compliments [vp2,2-] . And no one can suppose what will happen next, [sn9,-]  a fire can break out suddenly; a person falls down and need [vp3,5-]  to send [vp7,2-4]  to a hospital immediately; a robbery is going on [wd3,5-]  . . . . . .All these information [np3,1-] [np5,2-]   must be sent to the responsible ministry at once, [sn9,-]  only e telephone can help. In the trade world, all the business are [vp3,3-3]  busy like bees, they can't talk about everything face to face; or they are involved in business but they are distance [vp2, 3- 3]  from each other, they have to turn to the telephone for help. 	Without the telephone, we would waste our time and energy, or lose our affection. Without it, our society can not advance so quickly.  	Among the inventions, electric lights are one of them [sn8,s]  the world could not do without. 	Lights are really important things in our life [np3,2-] . Once, Granny Wang told me a story. Her grandma was ill one night and hey invited an old doctor to see her. The doctor had to perform an operation on her at once. But there is [vp6,2-3]  no electric lights at that time and she lighted a pile of branches [np2,4-]  to give light. Because of lacking light, the doctor made a mistakes [np3,2-]  and her grandma died. 	In the past, our ancestor [np3,1-4]  were afraid of darkness. They even can not know where they were if they lose [vp6,2-2]  their way at a cloudy night. But now, with the invention of electric lights, we can do our work properly as [sn8,s]  daytime. We can read, write and so on under [wd3,- 2]  the light. We can even travel by plane at night. Our life[np3,1-9]  will not be affected only because it's at night. 	I'm thankful for the contribution of the lights.
    
<ST 5> <SEX 2> <y 10> <SCH WSD> <AGE 20> <WAY 3><DIC 3> <TYP 1>  	Printing is especially important in contemporary society. The invention of printing skills have led to advances in printing. It is an invention the would [fm1,-] could not do without. 	The invention of printing skills [np5,4-4]  has a long history. China is an old country which invented printing skills ver one thousand years ago. Printing skills [np5,1-]  bring [vp3,2-4]  conveniences  [np5,1-]  in people's lives. Nowadays people using  [vp5,1-7]  [vp2,1-7]   printing skills [np5,1-]  print all kinds of things, such as books, magazines, newspapers etc. In the world thousands upon thousands newspaper [np3,3-2]  are printed and read everyday. People have spared [wd7,-]  much time and work since they knowed [fm1,-] printing skills. They don't need to copy many thing [np3,1-]  by hand. Printing skills [np5,1-]  is one of the important means of communication. If not been for it, people can't have transmissed [fm1,-] information so quickly and widely.	How can people live without printing skills [np3,1-] . It's so useful. Human beings will improve it with scientific techonology's development[cc1,2-]. 	In the [wd5,1-2]  modern world, more and more people use computer to help them do many things in many respects. Computer becomes an invention which the world could not do without. 	Now let's see how important computer becomes. In the research work of science, scientists use computer to analysise [fm1,-] the materials which they would find and work out the complicated problems. It calculates so fast that that [wd5,1-]  it can save much time and energy. In people's ordinary life [np3,3-] , many people use it to entertain them [pr4,2-] . They can play a chess with a computer, and they can also play other games with it. In people's work, it brings a lot of convenience, people can contact [vp2,1-4]  each other with it. A computer's memory is so good that it helps people a lot. 	It's horrible to suppose that what the world would become without computer. Nowadays, we should learn how to use the computer and make it do [wd3,2-5]  more convenience for the mankind.  	You are familiar with electricity though you can't really see it, because it is widely used nowadays. It's so important that everything will stop without . It is the invention the world could not do without. 	Can you imagine how the world would be if no [sn2,s-1]  electricity? We would be all [ad1,3-3]  in the dark [wd2,2-]  and all the machines failed [sn6,s-s]  to work. Before the electricity came [vp2,3-2]  to us, people used [wd4,1-3]  in many ways. It is not so convenient. After making good use of electricity life became easier. Electricity is used in [wd3,-3]  almost every home. Many house-hold applicants [wd3,2-4]  can't do without it, ranging from lights to refrigerators. Housewives become leisured for using electricity in hose [fm1,-]  work. Electricity also benefits [vp1,2-2]  in industry. It saves both time and labour in producing goods. It liberates workers from hard working beside [wd3,3-2]  the machine. [np6,-1] Workers just press a few buttons then [wd4,1-6]  can control the whole process of production owing to the electrical automution [fm1,-].	In short, electricity plays a key role in our life [np3,2-] . And it will be more important in the future.  Until now, electricity is the most important invention in the world. People can not do without it. If it had not been for this invention, the world would not have developed so fast. 	As we know, the invention of electricity led to the use of machines. With the development of the society, machines gradually took the place of human beings in the [wd5,1-1]  work. This not only save the labor but [wd4,7-1]  time. Moreover, machines can do a lot of things that human beings can not [sn6, 12-] . For example, a man is unable to lift several tons of sand from the first floor to the tenth floor, but a machine can do [wd5,4-] . In short, the present industry totally depends on electricity. As a result, people are free from [wd4,4-3]  tedious hard work. 	On the whole, electricity plays a [np7,1-3]  extremely important role in our society, especial [wd2,-s]  in the modern society. And the most important thing for human beings is to make full use of it for the development of people's living condition.  	An invention is a sign that the society makes progress. An invention [sn2,1-6]  the world could not do without. IF there is no invention, [wd4,-1]  world still live vp3,2-4]  in a cruelted [wd7,-1]  situation ---no clothes, no houses, no tools. We would still live in a primitive society. We got everything and should turned [vp3,1-4]  in to he master. We maybe [ad1,1-3]  ate the meal and would not have next meal. Why, [sn9,-]  because [fm3,-]  they couldn't hunt the animals. Just because there were inventions, our society improved. Paper --- it made our civilization spread. People concluded the experiences and taught [wd4,2-4]  descendants how [pr5,2-2]  to do and how to improve their work way [np1,23-] . Electrify [fm1,-]  --- if human beings didn't invent it, we would live in the dark, the factory couldn't produce [vp1,3-]  and many inventions couldn't be invented. In [pp2,-2] another word, there is no modern civilizative [cc4, 1]  world. 	Many examples has proved that the world could not do without an [np7,1-1]  invention. So we young people should learn and master knowledge, invent [wd7,-4]  and improve our world.  	Electricity is most important to [wd3,2-3]  the modern society. It is an invention the world could not do without. 	Imagine [vp7,1-3]  what would happen if suddenly there was no electricity? Cities would be completely [wd4,3-1]  dark in the evening and the night, for the lights couldn't be on without energy. The streets would be rather out of order and may have lots of traffic jams and accidents. There would be much more crimes, especially lootings [fm1,-] because of the mess. The people at their homes could do nothing but wait on sleep in the dark. Machines and other operating equipment [np3,3-]  in factories and other public services stopped [vp8, s-1]  working and may cause soundless damages and dangers. All in all, people in modern society could not live without electricity. lectricity [fm1,-]  plays such an important role in our society that it's a great loss of energy that many people waste it. Let's all use the electricity economically from now.  	An invention the world could not do without, what will it be ? I think it is electricity. Because now it's a [np7,1-4]  electronic and elecommunicate [fm1,-] era. the world could not do without lectricity [fm1,-] . 	Just imagine [vp7,1-4]  what will it be without electricity. In the daytime, we can't use the telephone, the computer, the refrigerator, the washing machine and the lift . . .. . . . We have to wash the clothes with our own hand [np3,3-] . We have to walk up to the high building . . . . In the evening, we can't see [wd3,-2]  the TV. We can't go to the cinema. We can't hear [wd3,-2]  the radio. And we can't go shopping. It's dark everywhere. There [pr2,1- 5] isn't a colourful light [fm1,-]  world. There's not so much recreation. It's too dull. It's unbearable [fm1,-] . It's so inconvenient without electricity. 	What's more, it's the electricity that cause [vp3,4-3]  the development  of science, even the development of the whole society. Because of the invention of electricity, then the other inventions which use electricity was [vp3,6-1] [vp2,1-1] existence, such as the radio, TV, telephone, refrigerator, computer, air-conditioner and so on. All these inventions are beneficial to us. If there is [vp8,2-2]  no electricity, many machines in the factories will [vp8, 5-1]  stop. Or the companies connected with the electron and the telecommunication [vp8,s-4]  have to close down. Many people will [vp8,2-5]  have no work to do. The rate  of unemployment will [vp8,4-1]  increase. And it will [vp8,2-2]  bring about a series of social problems. 	So we need the electricity every minutes [np3,1-] . The world could  not do without electricity. 	In our daily life [np3,3-] , electric light is very important. It brought [vp6,1-2]  man [fm1,-]  brightness and led man [wd3,1-6]  to a new century in industry.  	 After Edison invented electriclight [fm1,-], man could read, work and do anything in [pp2,1-1]  evening just like in [wd3,1-1]  daytime, . Without it, man was still in darkness. Nearly half of one day, night, was wasted before its invention. [sn8,s]  Electric light not only changed people's daily life [np3,2-] , but also stood for the beginning of the `electric times'. In industry electric power was a new energy source. Machines were moved [wd3,2-2] with[wd3,-] it and the factories were lit up,so workers would [vp9,2-4]  still work at night. 	Thoughout [fm1,-]  history man invented many things. Electric light was one of the most important invention [np3,5-]  without which man could no do.  	Paper, which is one of the four great inventions of [wd3,4-1]  China, is acting an important role in modern world. I can't imagine how the world would be without paper. 	Wherever you go, you'll see products which are made of paper. The most extensive [wd3,2-3]  use of paper is book. In present time, people are eager to learn knowledge, books are the basic tool for people to learn, especially for students. Except [wd3, 1-]  books, newspaper also needs paper. People read newspaper [np3,2-2]  every day, in order to obtain some useful informations [np5,2-2]  from it. Magazines, documents, even cashes and checks are made of paper. The advantage [fm1,-]  of paper is that it is very thin and light, you can use many pieces of paper to make a book but you won't feel it thick and heavy, and paper can last a long time. And another advantage of paper is that it doesn't cause any polution [fm1,-].	Paper is really a great help in our life [np3,2-] , we could not do without it.  	There is a most important invention in the world, without which we can do nothing --- it is electricity. 	Electricity is so important that it can help us to prove our productivity; it can make out [fm1,-]  society develop faster, and it can turn our modernization into truth. For example, thanks to electricity, we live a wonderful and colourful life. In [pp2,-2] space time, we can listen to the radio, [sn9,-]  to relax ourselves, or [sn6,s-s]  watch TV , [sn9,-]  to widen [wd3,1-2] our eyes, [sn9,-]  At work, we can use computer to finish our work quickly and excellently. [sn9,-]  At home, we can cook with electricity, which is not only quick, but also clean; more important, it save [vp3,1-3]  our much time. [sn9,-]  We can use telephone to keep touch [vp2, 2- 2]  with outside . . . . All of these depend on electricity. Without it, we can do nothing. 	Electricity is important so that we should use it properly and don't waste it freely [wd3,3-] !		Electricity is an invention that the world could not do without. It deeply [wd3,1-4]  changed man's production activities and life.  	With the invention of electricity, many machines depending [vp5,2-2]  on it have been coming out [sn8,s] . Electricity provides power for them. Without it, these machines, as fish lives without water, could not work. And the productive [np2,2-1]  activities would be forced to stop. Electricity is also essential to our life [np3,2-] . Our electric appliances such as TV, radio, refrigerator and air-conditioner would become waste [wd2,1-2]  to us if there were [vp3,2-2]  no electricity. Owing to electricity, people can get light [vp2,23-]  in the evening, warmth in the cold winter and coolness in the hot summer. Without it, we could not live [vp1,-3]  a normal life. 	It is not exaggerated to say that electricity is as importance [wd2,3-4]  as water and air. We must save as much electricity as we can.  		Detergent is a chemical produce [wd2,3-4]  used for cleaning things, especially for cleaning clothing [wd3,2-]  and dishes. To keep our clothing [wd3,2-]  and dishes clean is so important in our everyday life that our world would not do without the invention of detergent. 	Just imagine [vp7,1-5]  what would happen to us if there is [vp8,2-2]  no detergent? Dirty clothing [wd3,1-]  and dishes would pile up. And the dirty mess would not only make us feel sick but also cause some illness [wd3,2-] . And our world would surely be at sixes and sevens. Some people may say that we can use some kind of tree [np3,3-]  as well as people in actient  [fm1,-] time [np2,3-] . But in morden  [fm1,-] society, how can the poor productivity of that kind of trees meet our great need?	To keep our things clean is important for us to survive on the planet. And detergent does the most important role in cleaning. It's really an invention our world could [wd4,s-2]  do without.  	If the human being does not invent the electric power, the world could not do [wd3,4-] . 	I  am sure I do not exaggerate what I say. In fact, every day we need and use electric power. When we watch the TV [vp2,3-] , we need [wd4,1-1]  power. When we enjoy the air-condition, we as well need [wd1,3-2]  the power. In other words, if we use electric machine, we must use the electric power. Besides the need of our daily lives, the social development also need [vp3,4-1]  power . Without power, the factories can't work, the schools can't open normally, the shops an't open and the lifts can't work. At night, without power, the world will be dark everywhere, people not only can't work but also can't entertain [vp1,1-] . The world will become depressing [ad2,2-1]  dark. Above all, we know the importance of the power. It is necessary and useful. We can't do without it. The world could not do without it.  	An invention the world could not do without [sn8,s]  is clothes. 	Clothes are one of the primitive element [np3,4-3]  for human life. We cover our body with clothes. It's polite to do that. Wearing clothes prevent the sunlight from burning our skins. The most importance [wd2,2-2]  of all, we use clothes to keep warm. In primitive society, the primitive used animal skins as clothes. It assured [vp7,1-1]  that they wouldn't die of cold [wd2,2-]  easily. Fancy one day we would haven't [vp2,2-2]  any clothes. Even if we wouldn't be shy to face each other, we would die of cold [wd2,2-] . Especially to the weak and the old, they haven't enough energy to keep warm. Clothes are their necessities. 	In a word, clothes are our daily necessities. They protect us in a hot and cold weather.

<ST 5> <SEX 2> <Y 10> <SCH WSD> <AGE 20> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> 	Reading extensively is a good habit, it's necessary for us to form this habit. [sn1,s]Reading extensively is good to increase your [fm1,-]  word power, you can also get more background knowledge from the book you read extensively. [sn1,s]	 [sn7,0-4] Learning a foreign language, vocabulary is  [fm1,-] veer importance[wd2,-]. If you don't master enough words, you will have difficulty in progressing.  [fm3,-] however, to keep new words in mind is difficult to most of us. Reading extensively can help you save[wd3,-] this hard problem. In our daily life, we are familiar with the things we often see. It's the same in  [wd3,-] remembering new words , you can't remember a new word when you meet it first time, but you'll sure[wd2,-] remember it after you meet it several times. [sn1,s]Reading extensively offers the chance to you to meet the new words again and again, that means reading extensively is helpful in mastering new words. [sn1,s]Reading extensively will also help you get more background knowledge [sn9,-] During extensive reading, you will come across all kinds of subjects, and different subject[fm1,-]offers you different knowledge.  [fm3,-] as time goes by, you will get different kinds of knowledge. As a result,  [np7,-] the reading comprehension is just a piece of cake to you.	In short, reading extensively is good to us, we should do more reading and take reading extensively as our hobbies. [sn1,s]	Reading extensively is [np7,0-1]  most important part of learning  English.  [fm3,-] reading extensively is  [np7,-] the way that we know some information by [wd3,-]reading. In [wd3,0-2]  reading extensively class, we learn different reading methods and how to improve our reading speed. 	As we know, there are different goals in reading. For example, if we want to know  [np7,-] the special information, we can use skimming. Second, we read a lot of passages within  [wd3,-] special time in  [np7,-] the class. [fm3,-] that  [vp3,-] make us speed up. The reading methods help us improve our reading speed. 	Reading extensively is a tool to know information  [pp2,-] by reading.  [fm3,-] when we are good at it, [pr1,-] that, [sn9,-]of course, [sn9,-]will improve[np4,0-2]  English level.  	I think it important to read extensively, although some people suggest reading intensively. 	Reading extensively can do much good to our study. If one  [vp3,-] read extensively, he can benefit a lot.  [fm3,-] first, he can increase his speed of reading. When you read more books, you will be familiar with the structure of a sentence, then, you can just cast your eyes on several words and understand the whole sentence [sn9,-] [sn1,s]  Secondly, reading extensively can enlarge your command of vocabulary when you read some kinds of books on different [np6,-] field, you may come across some new words. [sn1,s]You don't need to look up the dictionary. It's certain that the word will appear [pp1,0-1] in somewhere. From the text, you can try to guess its meaning. In this way, you can learn a lot of new words. Last but not the last, reading extensively is a real eye-opener. You mustn't always be concentrated on certain kind of books. It will limit your knowledge. You had better try your best to learn more, that means, [sn9,-] you[vp6, -] had have to read extensively. [sn1,s]	In short, in my opinion, reading extensively is very useful to our command of knowledge. We benefit a lot from it.  	Books are good friends to us human beings. We learn things not only from experience but also more from books. Some people think we should read books extensively while others think it should do intensively. [sn8,s]In my opinion, we should read extensively. 	There are hundreds and a thousand [np7,3-] books in the world, and also all kinds of books. Every book has its own value. So if  we want to learn more things, we must read more and there is not enough time and no need for us to read every book carefully. We had to choose reading.  Some books on your major should be read carefully; and [,0-9]  some just for fun can only look it through.  [fm3,-] secondly, [sn2,0-10]  with the progress of  [fm1,-] socialty and developed[wd2,1-0] in all aspect. In order to match this requirement, we should learn more, not only our major but also other interests[wd3,-]. Moreover, interests out of work can help us [sn9,-] [fm3,-] without an extensive base, how can we build a high building?	In a word, reading can help us learn knowledge and extensive reading can make us learn more. Let's read extensively in a limited life.  	Reading extensively, as a way in learning English, is very helpful for me. 	First, reading extensively can increase my vocabulary, while reading some English works, many new words will appear in the lines, and I can guess their means[wd3,-] by reading between the lines instead of looking them up in the dictionary. [sn1,s]Those words may be read from one work to another, and then impress me so much that I have  [vp6,-] remember them clearly, and my vocabulary is increased. 	Second, reading extensively can improve my  [fm1,-] gramma I can know more  [fm1,-] gramma knowledge by learning the authors' method of organizing words and sentences. 	Finally, reading extensively can also improve my writing comprehensive[wd2,-]. I learn more background knowledge about different words and sentences by reading different [np6,-] kind of English works, then I can grasp their differentmeans[wd3,-] and use them fluently. [sn1,s] 	In short, reading extensively is a helpful way for me to learn English well, and I think it's the same to others. [sn1,s]  	Reading extensively [vp9,0-2]  can helps us a lot, especially to the English majors though it takes a lot of time. 	Firstly, reading extensively can enlarge our vocabulary. As you know, if we want to have a good command  [np2,1-0] over English, we must have a large vocabulary. There are so many words for us  to remember. [sn2,9-14]  Especially the new words and sometimes the longer words which are different[wd3,-] to remember. If we do more extensive reading, we can come across them in different situations. So [,1-6]  will help us to remember them, at least to be morre familiar with them. Meantime[sn8,-], if we run across a new word during our reading [sn9,-]  we can guess its meaning from the content. It also can  [vp2,-] help enlarge our vocabulary. 	Secondly, reading extensively can abroad[fm1,-] our knowledge. The more we read, the wider knowledge we have. [, 0-5]  Reading different kinds of books,  [cc4,0-2] varied level [cc1,1-1]  books can help us understand more about the world. Different kinds of books have varied contents and different characters. The knowledge we get from the lesson is limited. So we want to open our eyes, we must do extensive reading. [sn1,s]	Extensive reading benefits us a lot.  	It's very important for us to read extensively, [sn9,-] because it can widen our sight and enlarge our knowledge. A person's knowledge is limited, he should read extensively to get different[np6,-]idea. [sn1,s]By reading extensively we know a lot. Reading travelling book, for example, makes us know the customs, [sn9,-]scenery of different  [np6,-] country. Although we have little chance to get there, y reading it we can imagine the beautiful place. Most people think that they should read only the books which help them in their major. That is wrong. Take a businessman for example, [sn9,-]the books he should read are on not only economics but also politicals [fm1,-] or anything else. As a businessman, he can take advantage of it. Moreover, when he contact with different people, he should know a lot to communicate with them [np1,s-]  then he can arrive [wd4,-]decision with other people. 	In all, it's important and necessary to read extensively, and it can make our lives rich.  	It's said that reading extensively can make you intelligent. In my opinion, its really important for us students to do more reading. Thus we can learn more. 	Reading  [fm3,-] Extensively benefits you a lot, first of all, it can enrich your knowledge in wide [cc4,-1]fields, such as science, culture, art, etc. [sn1,s] [fm3,-] maybe you'll not become an expert, but what you get from reading extensively is helpful for you to solve many kinds of problems. It's quite practical. Besides, reading more and reading extensively can make you intelligent. When you're reading, you use your brain to think, to remember. In this way, you can [vp2,0-4]  practice your brain's ability. By all means [,-s]  it helps us with our study a lot.  [fm3,-] he who wants to learn more and make more progress must do more extensive reading.	In a word, reading extensively is essential and useful. all of us should do it.  	As everybody knows, reading is the most direct way to absorb knowledge. And reading extensively is of great importance in reading. 	Firstly, reading extensively can improve our reading skills. [sn2, s-]  The old saying'[sn9,-]Practice makes perfect' [sn9,-]This is always true. In order to make a [cc3,1-2]good master of certain thing, we must do a lot of practice. Only through reading extensively, [sn9,-]can we read a lot and learn a lot. The more we read, the better and aster can we understand what we read. Gradually, we can read much faster and without missing anything, [sn9,-] extensively [wd2,-] can save a lot of time and trouble in reading and improve the quality of our reading. Through reading extensively,  can skim the article more quickly. In this way, we can not only select the [fm1,-]  art we [vp4,-1]  interested [vp2,1-2]  to read and also [cj2,1-] those we [vp4,0-1]  don't [vp4,-1]interested in, but also grasp the article's main idea more quickly accurately. 	How essential is reading extensively.[sn9, -]We can benefit a lot from reading extensively. 	As a student, you should read extensively, [sn9,-] because it is a good way for study. It's also a good habit. 	First, reading extensively is a good method of getting knowledge. The more you read, the more you know. You can learn from reading without moving. Just [vp4,1-0]  sitting there, you can read various kinds of books ranging from quide [fm1,-]-books to novels, which means you can learn different kinds of knowledge [fm1,-]  ranging from science to literary [wd2,-]. Secondly, reading extensively is a good way to improve your reading skill. One can pratise[wd3,0-2] his speed of reading if he [vp3,1-0]  read a lot. He will know the structures of the sentences, [sn9,-] if he reads so many similar sentences. So he can get the meanings of the sentences correctly. Besides, he can [wd3,0-2]  improve his vocabulary, [sn9,-] because he will meet lots of new words when he [vp3,1-0]  do reading. Thirdly, reading extensively is a good way to relax yourself. You will forget everything annoyed when you are reading. [sn8,s]In short, if you consider reading extensively as your habit [sn9,0-2] , instead of a boring thing, you can benefit from it a lot.   Extensive reading, that [sn5,-s]  means read [vp4,2-1]  books as many as possible, not just a certain kind of books but also all kinds of [wd4,-].I think  [vp4,2-] do more reading is good for us. As a college student, our [pr3,3-]  knowledge should not be confined to a certain range, we should know more, [sn6,-s]  learn more. [sn1,s] If we just read some kind of books, there will be a great blank place is wanted for us to explore. [sn8, s]  	Take me for example, [sn9,-] I like to read some books on history. When I do some exercise [np6,1-]  on computer or stock market, I find it difficult to understand, for I seldom read books on this respect. Currently [wd3,0-] , I realize that it's harmful, at least not good for us to meek [fm1,-]  progress.  The world is so beautiful and the knowledge is endless. Every subject has its own value and knowledge,do [vp4,-3] more reading can enable us to have better understanding and widen our eye[cc1,-1] vision. [sn1,s] But maybe someone will ask, if I put my whole heart on certain subject, perhaps I can be an expert. [sn7,s]However, don't forget one thing, not everyone want [vp3,1-]to be an expert, especially we will come across many kinds of things in our daily life. [sn1,s]If we obtain some kinds of knowledge on some expect [fm1,-] , your [pr1,9-]confidence will be more [aj3,-1]better, but that just depends on doing more reading. [sn1,s] 	Do [vp4,-3]  more reading is worthwhile.  	Reading extensively means to read all kinds of book [np6,3-] , ranging from common knowledge to science [wd2,-1]  materials. It is a very good way to enrich our knowledge. if no do so [sn8,s] , we will know more about our society, our country and even the current events or anything else around the world. 	We live in a certain rang [fm1,-]  in the society. We may be familiar with what happen [vp3,1-]  around us. However, what we know from the limited area is limited. We must stand in other ways [wd7,3-] to know more. Reading extensively is a good way. Take us for example, [sn9,-]  we live on the campus most of our time. if [fm3,-]  we don't read newspaper or listen to the radio, we don't know what happen [vp3,1-]  outside. So, addition to [pp2,1-]  our text book, we should read more books which are on economy, sport, entertainment and science. Knowing [cc3,-5]more all kinds of information, we will study better. One more example [sn9,-] , in our extensive reading course, there are all kinds of reading materials. we [fm3,-]  have never met such things, [sn9,-]  like the cause to rain, wind [sn6,2-]  etc, we can't understand the article clearly. [sn1,s]	In a word, Reading extensively can enrich our knowledge.  The more we do, the better.  	Extensive reading is an important course in language learning. It can increase the students' wordpower [fm1,-], broad their knowledge of background [np1,3-]  and develop their abilities of reading comprehension. 	As we all know, reading is a basic ability in learning language, but we will learn limited knowledge just by [wd3,-2]  intensive reading . Extensive reading has many advantages as compared [cj1,1-1]  with intensive reading. First, we acquired [vp6,s-]  knowledge of many aspects through reading lots of material, [sn9,-] which are unavailable in intensive reading. Second, we mostly learn grammar and other basic abilities in intensive reading. However, extensive reading provide [fm1,-] [vp2,-3] [vp3,2-] us many articles, [sn9,-] which contain a lot of new words. Thus learn more new words effectively through reading extensively, [sn8,-s]which, we develop the skills such as guess, estimation, judgment[fm1,-], which make us do better in reading comprehension and make progress in the end.[sn8,s]  	In a word, extensive reading is a good way to have a command of language. We learn primary language [wd3,1-]  in intensive reading, whereas we learn broader language [wd3,1-]  in extensive reading.  	If we can afford time to read all kinds of book [np6,3-] , we can get a lot from it. Reading extensively can widen [vp2, -2]  our eye and strengthen our ability [np2,-3]  of solving problem  [np6,1-] . 	First if we read extensively, we can know lots of things about our world, we can know things about [pp1,1-3]  from the sky to geography, from our motherland to the foreign country, from the history of the world to nowsday [fm1,-] and even the future [sn4,s-] . Thus, we can keep up with the development of the world. Secondly, if we read all kinds of books, we can strength our ability [np2,-3]  of solving problem [np6,1-] . take [fm3,-]  studying English for example, [sn9,-]  since the knowledges [np5,1-] are connected with each other, English also is connected with geography and history of England or America will understand and learn better than those who have know little about the foreign country.[sn,s].  That's why the teacher ask [vp3,2-]  us to read more book [np6,1-]  about foreign country background [cc1,2-] . 	Reading extensively do [vp3,2-]  lots of good to us. we [fm3,-]  should read good [fm1,-]  as many as possible and try to be a man who knows ' [sn9,-] something of everything and everything of something' [sn9,-] .    Reading extensively do [vp3,2-]  good to you in some respect [np6,1-] . It can improve [wd3,-2]  your vocabulary. It can open your eye [np6,1-] . It's my view on reading extensively.	First, it can improve [wd3,-2]  your vocabulary, [sn9,-] We always come across a lot of unknown words, any [fm1,-]  we can remember them. If we read  book [np6,1-] , we can guess the meaning of the word accordingly [wd2,-1]  to the contact [fm1,-] . And we read extensively, [sn6,s]and the word always go [vp3,3-]  into your eyes. you [fm3,-]  will remember it. In this way, you will remember a lot of worlds. Second, reading extensively can open your eye [np6,1-] . As we know, we do not have enough thing [np6,1-]  to learn , to study, to know everything except our major, [sn8,s]  and we also do not have enough money to travel [vp1,-2]  every place in the world. If we want to know something that we don't know, we can read book [np6,1-] . We can learn lots of things from reading extensively. 	Teacher [np7,-2]  always tell [vp3,2-]  us to read extensively. Because reading extensively do [vp3,2-]  good to us in most respect [np6,1-] . [sn2,s-]  The most important [wd4, 3-5]  for our [pr4,1-]  English major is that , [sn9,-]  it can improve [wd3,-2]  our vocabulary and open our eye [np6,1-] .   	As we all know, reading is very important because it is the main way we get knowledge [sn8,s] [sn9,-]   However, some people just do some reading on one or two subject [np6,3-] . It is so limited and I think reading extensively is much better that that.	Some people may say: It is enough if I'm much [wd2,-1] good at one subject. If you can change [wd7,-2]  one subject very well, that's good but not enough. Because you will know nothing about other subject [np6,1-] , and that will effect [wd2,-2]  you major for many things are related.[sn,s].  Reading extensively will open your eyes. On the other hand, reading extensively will improve you major study. Take ourselves for example, [sn9,-] we major in English, so if we read more in English, we can not only get more knowledge on other subject [np6,1-]  but also improve our reading ability in English.	Therefore, I think reading extensively is very good for us, for it can open our eyes and improve our major study. 	Nowadays, there are so many advertisement [np6,2-]  on radio and TV. The positive and negative [np7,3-1]  effect of advertising are both obvious. 	Let us talk about the positive effect [np6,2-] first. After a factory or a company produce [vp3,5-] a new product, it wants anyone [wd3,s-] to know the new product, [sn9,-] in order to sell it succeefully [fm1,-]. On the other hand, some people want to buy certain kind [np6, 1-2] of goods. By hearing or watching the advertisments [fm1,-], they can have more choices to choose the one which is good enough. then [fm3,-]  [wd3,s-] let's focus on the negative effect [np6,2-]. When you are watching a wonderful football match on TV. [sn9,-] Suddenly there are some advertisements. Being interrupted, you will be very disappointed and angry. What's more,there are some ads which are not good enough.some [fm3,-] may mislead Children [fm3,-], say ads on [pp1,1] wine and cigarette [np6,2-]. Or some may frighten Children [fm3,-] [sn9,-]	So I think we should reduce some ads which are harmful to Children [fm3,-] and remain [wd3,-1] those which are connected with people's life [np6,1-].  	Many people like reading. Some may read extensively and some may [fm1,-]  read intensively. Each way has its advantages and disadvantages. But reading extensively is a better way to read. 	First, nowadays, people are so busy that they read extensively. Because if you read extensively, you can use less time to read more books. [sn2,s-] So saving time is one of the advantages of this reading method. Second, with the development of the world, more books have been published. Everyday, there are hundreds of even thousands of books been published.[sn,s].  If you read them intensively, you can't read  all of them. Moreover, not all the books are useful and good. You may read some useless and meaningless books.But if you read extensively, you will have more choice [np6,1-] of books. So you can choose the best one to read. 	In a word, reading extensively can save your time and energy. Moreover, it can help you to choose the best book to read. 

<ST 5> <SEX 1> <Y 8> <SCH WSD> <AGE 20> <WAY 3> <DIC 2> <TYP 1>	There is an ironical sight on the campus. Many people buy and ride stolen bicycles while they are suffering a lot from the unbridled bicycle theft. Bicycle theft is by no means a rare case on the campus. A teacher said  her family has [vp3, 5-]  altogether been stolen  twelve bikes which was really a burden on a patroller's family.[sn,s].  Frequently, we can hear students be stolen bikes, [sn8,s]  even though they have equip the bicycles with several locks. Bicycle theft is so commonplace that even police won't border [fm1,-]  to accepts [wd7,2-] .Once [fm1,-]  may wonder: how come the bicycle theft so furious ?[sn8,s]First [sn9,-]  as the saying goes "as virtue rises one foot, vice rises ten", thieves seem to be able to crack all kinds of locks. And seldom have we heard thieves been caught. [sn9,-] [sn,s].  Secondly, there has form a vicious circle [sn8,s] .People in fear of bicycle theft prefer to buy he spoils [wd7,2-] , as they are cheaper, [sn6,s-]  thus encourage the forming of black markets. Thieves resell the booty fm1,-]  there and make great profit. the [fm1,-]  encourage the evil trend. Bicylcle[fm1,-] theft is a thing we all ate bitterly. To irradicate   [fm1,-] it, we must not buy any spoils and all take action against it.[sn,s].  First thing first sweep all black markets.[sn8,s]  	My view [fm3,-]  on studying [fm3,-]  [fm3,-]  abroad	If you have enough money, your family could afford you and you have such a great chance to study abroad, I think you hould [fm1,-]  catch this opportunity without hestity [fm1,-]. 	Studying abroad could make you independence [wd2,2-] , that means You're[fm3,-] growing up, you're no longer a child in your family and you could [vp6,10-] take care of yourself and also make your own decision. [sn1,s]You could [vp6,s-]  learn how to communicate with others [wd2,-1]  people. If you are major in English [sn9,-]  studying abroad could [vp6, s-]  improve your oral English and make great progress in your subject,[sn8,s] [sn9,-]  you will be forced to  glish [fm1, -]  in no time. Studying abroad could [vp6,s-]  wide [wd2,3-2]  your view [wd3,2-] , [sn9,-]  you would know more about the foreigner's culture, traditional [wd2,3-2]  and customs. You are no more a frog in the well if you study abroad. Catch that chance immediately if you have.  	The use [sn9,-]of Computers[sn9,-]  Computers, the advanced machines, to world of good to mankind.[sn8,s] First, they can count very fast and people save much time. Secondly, they can store information. When people need the information, they can consult the computers [np6,1-] . Computers really have many uses and are helpful to people. Before the computers [np6,1-]  are [vp6,3-]  invented, people use [vp6,s-]  abacus to count. But the speed of count [wd2,3-]  is so slow that people spend [vp6,s-]  much time. Computers can count very fast. A complicated maths problem can be done in a minute by them. They can store much information. They have good memory. When people consult one of the information, the screen of the computer will demonstrate  it correctly. Today, many businessmen take a computer with them in order to consult information at any time. With the development of industry, computers become more and more useful and more uses are found by people. People try to invent more advanced computer [np6,3-] . 	Library is the storehouse of knowledge and a paradise for people thirst [wd2,1-2]  for knowledge. There are innumerable libraries all over the world. A library has many functions. 	First of all [sn2,s-] . It serves as a storehouse for books written in any times [fm1,-]  and at any places [fm1,-] . a [fm3,-]  large library usually has a large collection of rare books, manuscripts, periodicals and other reading materials. A library can get its books by buying , donation, or exchanging with other libraries. It can get in touch with the publishing houses so as to get every edition published. All these are unparallable  [fm1,-] by any individual collection. All libraries lend themselves to helping form a profound cultural atmosphere in the society and helping people learn things [, s-] . It is a free school for self-studied [fm1,-]  people and a [np7,-1]  ideal place for scholars or researchers. Considering all these, the construction of libraries should be attached much importance to and we should make full use of them.

But now I have a problem and I would like your advice. I lost my counting number. and [fm3,-]  now I am in bad need of the money to buy some stocks. But without the counting umber, I could draw the [np7,-]money from the bank. I don't know what to do. Shall I come to the bank to change the counting number with my ID card and then draw the money? Will it take me a long time to do so? I really need the money in these days. I hope you could give me an advice [np5,1-] once you have spare time. thank [fm3,-]  you very much. 	Yours Sincerely[sn9,-]Ivy Smith March 27, 1997 Dear Sammy: How are you? I'm so glad to know that you wanted to come to my hometown, Shanshui. Ok, let me tell you how to come here. Shanshi is to the Northwest [fm3,-]of GZ, about 45 kilometers away. I'd like you to come by train. Because it's much easier for you than come by bus [sn4,s-] . The train gets started [fm1,-]  from Guangzhou Railway Station. About one hour later, it reaches Fashion Station. The next Station [fm3,-]  would be Shanty Station. When the train is near Shanty Station, it will pass [vp2,-1]  through a bridge. It's the only bridge between Fashion and Shanty. You can't miss it. when [fm3,-]  the train is about one KM away from the station, you will find the railway is higher than the street along the railway. You can also see a park on the left side. When the train stops, you will see several advertising boards on the left side. On one of them, you can see the Lining Sports Cloths sign. You get down and I'll be on the platform waiting for you. I'm looking forward [vp2,1-1]  from your arrival and I hope to see you soon.   Yours sincerely[sn9,-]  Hivin	 

<ST 5> <SEX 1> <Y 8> <SCH WSD> <AGE 20> <WAY 2> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> I like all kinds of sports, but jogging is my favourite. It's the most effective and convenient way for me to relax. 	After a long time of study, I usually do some jogging. I jog along the path on the campus, relaxing my body and my mind. I don't have to think about anything on study while I'm jogging. Sometimes I can also throw off some bad mood and get high spirit after a long distance of jogging,while I'm jogging, I can enjoy the scenery on my campus and breathe fresh air among the trees [sn7,s-]  which really make [vp3,2-]  me relax. [sn1,s] Beside [fm1,-] ,I can jog without any companion or any sports equipment, so I can do it whenever I want. Jogging is so relaxable [wd3,3-] that I keep on doing it nearly everyday and I quite enjoy it.  Recently, bicycle theft often happen [vp3,3-]  in [pp2,-2]  the campus. Students lose their bikes in front of the store, before [wd3,-3]  the classroom building or even in the dormitories. It seems that bicycle locks are ineffective because bicycles with two or even more locks are still stolen. Carelessness is one of the reason [np6,3-]for bicycle theft, sometimes the owner is too careless not [wd5,2-1]to lock his bicycle [sn7,s-]which provides a good chance for thieves. [sn1,s] Take full precautions [cc4,2-] against the bike being stolen. It's also necessary to hire someone to keep an eye on the bicycles before [wd3,-3]the classroom [fm1,-]  buildings. Besides, severe punishment to the thieves should have been made. Frothier [wd7,s-],the policemen [np6,1-] of the campus should walk around the campus once in a while, especially during the classes [wd7,3-].    Bicycle theft is a common problem in [wd3,-2]  every campus. Any measures [np6,1-]  will be carried out in vain if we don't take any step to deal with the thief. Only when they realize that it's illegal to stole [fm1,-]  anything, [sn9,-]  can bicycle theft be prevented.  If I am invisible, I won't be token [fm1,-]  a photograph , [sn9,-]  my friends won't say hello to me when I meet them, [sn9,-]  I won't be asked to answer a question by my teachers, [sn9,-]  maybe I will be hit by the pedestrians or cars or bicycles because they can't see my image. and [fm1,-]  maybe I will be looked [wd7,3-3]  in the readingroom [fm1,-] of the library because the assistant can't see me and I am absorbed in the interesting books . . . How horrible it is if I am invisible! 	If I am invisible, I can get on a plane or a cargoship [fm1,-] to travel around the world and then come back in the same way; I can go  into the libraries or bookshops and read every kinds [np6,1-]  of books without time limit; I can follow the criminals and beat them down and arrest them; I can make fun of my enemy and get him deadly frustrated; I can go into the military bases to have a look at the weapons without being caught; and I can do good deeds for the poor and the weak .    . . How terrific it is to be invisible!  The tax rate in China is quite high. There are quite a great umber of people who are opposed to the tax policy. But I support the tax law in China. Today's China [cc1,2-]  is [np6, -2]  developing country and we have a lot of things to do [sn9, s-]  which need [vp3,1-]  a great sum of money. For example, to pension [vp1,-2] the handicapped, to build  highways, to support our army, to develop our navy, and to help the poverty-stricken area [np6,2-3] such as Tibet [sn8,s]  . . . on [fm3,-]  the other hand, because our country is a developing country, we should spend more money in reproducing[cc3,-1] country, we should spend more money in reproducing than in comsuption [fm1,-]. To do that, the government has to enforce a high tax law [cc4,3-] .  	Everyone is visible,that is for sure. [sn1,s] But I hope I were invisible. If I were invisible, that would be wonderful. and [fm3,-]  I would do a lot that a common person can't do. 	First, I would give [vp2,-3]  good lessons to the criminals. As you know, there are so many crimes in China. Let's take the pocket-pick-up [fm1,-] for instance. When the pocket-pickers commit a crime, they often have knives with them. So even when some passengers find they are stealing other's money. [sn2,s-]  They don't dare  to stop the crime, for they are afraid of being hurt or even killed by the crimals [fm1,-]. If I were invisible, I would beat these criminals heavily or beat they [pr4,1-] lightly from time to time. They could not see me. Then they might think that they have incountered [fm1,-]  a spirit and stop the crime. If they don't stop, I would continue beating them. Besides giving [vp2,-4]  the crimials  [fm1,-] good lessons, I would go anywhere all over the world. Since there are so many beautiful sceneries  [fm1,-] and wonders. [sn2,s-]  I would like to appreciate them .And I could go by bus or train or plane without paying the fares, for I were [vp8,s-] invisible.No one would know my existence. 	If I were really invisible, I could do many other things for my country and the people. How wonderful. [sn9,-]   	Guangzhou is a big city, and there are so many cars, buses, motorbikes and bikes in this city, [sn9,-] However,but [cj1,1-]  the roads or [wd3,2-1] streets are not big enough, So [fm3,-] the traffic problem of Guangzhou is very serious. 	The number of cars and buses and other vehicles, [sn9, -]belonging to Guangzhou is big.[sn,s].  What's more, Guangzhou is a Central City in GuangDong [fm3,-]Province, [sn9,-]buses [fm3,-]  from south to north or cars from north to south have to pass [vp2,-1] Guangzhou, [sn9,-] they [fm3,-]  occupy a lot [wd4,2-]  roads in Guangzhou. 	The roads or [wd3,2-1]  streets in Guangzhou are not wide. The biggest ones only allow two buses to drive side by side in  direction. Most of they [pr4,2-] only allow tne bus to drive in one children [fm1,-] . If a traffic accident happened. [sn9,-] There [fm3,-]  would be a traffic jam. Once the road was blocked, the cars which were damaged couldn't be pulled off the road,the traffic jam would be very serious. [sn1,s] 	Besides the two reasons, there are still some reasons that make the traffic problem serious. 	In [wd3,-3]  some important cross-roads. [sn2,s-]  There [fm3,-]  have not flyovers [fm1,-] or not enough flyovers [fm1,-], [sn8,s]this [fm3,-]is also a main reason why the traffic problem is so serious in Guangzhou. And you know, this City [fm3,-]  is divided by the Pearl River, there are some bridges built over the river,but there are not enough [sn9,-] and some of them are narrow. [sn9,-] [sn1,s]Such as the Pearl River Bridge, [sn9,-]it [fm3,-]  only allows [vp2,-3] one buses [np3,1-]drive[vp2,-1]  through in each direction, [sn9,-] to [fm3,-]  make it worse, it's the only bridge in that direction, all vehicles coming in [wd3,1-5] or going out of Guangzhou in that place must pass [vp2,-3]through the bridge. [sn1,s]So traffic jam [np6,2-1] there is [vp3,3-]ordinary, especially in the morning or in the afternoon. Each time, I am frighten [wd2,2-] when the bus is about to pass [vp2,-3]  through that bridge.	That some drivers ignore the traffic rules is another reason. Some bus drivers pick up passengers anywhere if there has [vp6,1-]no policemen.[sn,s].  And some ignore the traffic lights as long as no policemen are there. These also make the problem worse. 	To make the traffic problem less serious, something must be done. The roads must be widened; build more bridgesthe drivers who break the rules and so on.[sn,s].  If all of these were done. [sn9,-]I'm sure the traffic of Guangzhou would be much better.      Many young people in China are longing  for the chance to study abroad because which [pr2,s-]  can not only benefit them a lot but also  do good to our country.     First, studying abroad is the precious opportunity for us to improve our study in some course. Though our country has developed [vp6,s-]  by reaps [fm1,-]  and bounds, we still can't keep up with the Western countries in some aspects, such as management system, science and education system. Since we're the [np7,-4]  part of the world, we must build up good relationship between other from all over the work [wd3,7-] . Secondly, every year our government sends some  learners to study abroad in  order that they will make their contribution to our country after their return. Qiang Xueshen , a famous expert in missile, is devoting [vp2,-3]  to our society in scientific  field after his return from America.      Please seize the opportunity to study abroad if there is a chance for you.  	Every country has its own advanced civilization, [sn9, -]its own rich  cultural heritage. Thus, learning from each other, so to seak [wd7,3-] , studying abroad is quite essential.      A country who wants to improve herself should be wise enough to take open policy. Close causes backward [wd7, 3-] . In this sense, sending [vp2,-3]  scholars studying abroad is a practicable [fm1,-]  way. For instance, in some fields the U S [fm1,-]  has the most famous scientists in the world who study latest [aj3,-1]  subjects. Students learning from them can get the most out of them when the students master advanced knowledge's [fm1,-]and technology, they return home and make great contribution to their country. [sn1,s] Furthermore, Studying [fm3,-]  abroad helps countries  understand and cooperate with each other. How can two countries without much  idea [np5,1-]  of [wd3,1-2] each other get along well? In the third place, studying abroad is extremely important to students learning foreign languages. Without studying abroad, students may speak a foreign language with local dialect [wd3,6-] . That's an inevitable thing only can be settled by studying abroad. [sn8,s]       In a word, studying abroad plays an important role in modern world [np7,1-2] . 	  

<ST 5> <SEX 1> <Y 8> <SCH WSD> <AGE 20> <WAY 2> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> My favorite [fm3,-]  sport [fm3,-]  Table tennis has been my favorite sport since I was in primary school. I prefer table tennis to other sports because it is a simple but enjoyable sport. Unlike soccer, basketball and other sports, table tennis is one of the mildest sport [np6,4-] . We do not have to be very strong to play table tennis, [sn9,-] because it is won by skill instead of by strength. Injuries hardly occur in playing table tennis. Playing table tennis can build up our body as other sports do. While playing table tennis, we have to react quickly and accurately. As a result, we are trained to be agile [fm1,-] . In addition,table tennis takes little space. we can play it indoors without worrying about bad weather. with [fm3,-]  so many advantages, table tennis attracts a lot of people. If you want to take up a sport as a recreation as well as a [np7, 1-]  exercise, pick up a table tennis bat.  	My view [fm3,-]  on one-child [fm3,-]  [fm3,-]  policy	The population of 1. 2 billion has been a great burden on China. In this situation, the government's one-child policy is necessary. With the big cardinal figure, Chinese population grows by leaps and bounds, bringing a lot of trouble. Food is the first thing's firs [fm1,-] . With [wd3,3-]  the large population, the country's food supply proves inadequate. Over-population would cause mass starvation. If Chinese population keeps boosting, the country will run out of natural resources in near future. The [np7,-1]  life would be miserable because few daily necessities would be available. In addition, the country would be overcrowded and ecology would be out of balance. The government's one-child policy is an effective means to avoid these ossible [fm1,-]  tragedies caused by over-population. People should notice its significance and back [wd7,-1]  it.  	Eating in a neighbourhood canteen is [fm1,-]  disadvantageous	To avoid the trouble of cooking and doing wash-up, some people prefer to eat in a neighbourhood canteen. Yet, more trouble can be found there. As you stand in the long queue for the meal, a lot of time is wasted, not to say someone might carelessly drop some soup on your white shirt. [sn8,s] There're so many people there that grabing [fm1,-] a seat is not an easy job. Sitting in the stuffy and nosy [fm1,-]  air, fussed by some flies, you can't help losing appetite. The food is supposed to be delicious, but many a time you're disappointed to find the dishes unpotable [fm1,-]. They turn out to be too rare or burnt, with too much or no salt. If you can't get to the canteen in time because of the raining [wd3,-1]  day or working late, no meals are available. The worst may be that infectious disease are easily caught there because the plates and bowls are not cleaned thoroughly. It sounds nice to take some pains to cook a favorite meal and then sit comfortably enjoying it in your pleasant dinning-room, doesn't it? 	Library is the storehouse of knowledge and a paradise for people thirst [wd2,1-2]  for knowledge. There are innumerable libraries all over the world. A library has many functions. 	First of all [sn2,s-] . It serves as a storehouse for books written in any times [fm1,-]  and at any places [fm1,-] . a [fm3,-]  large library usually has a large collection of rare books, manuscripts, periodicals and other reading materials. A library can get its books by buying , donation, or exchanging with other libraries. It can get in touch with the publishing houses so as to get every edition published. All these are unparallable  [fm1,-] by any individual collection. All libraries lend themselves to helping form a profound cultural atmosphere in the society and helping people learn things [, s-] . It is a free school for self-studied [fm1,-]  people and a [np7,-1]  ideal place for scholars or researchers. Considering all these, the construction of libraries should be attached much importance to and we should make full use of them.

<ST 5> <SEX 2> <y 10> <sch wsd> <AGE 20> <WAY 3> <DIC 99> <TYP >	My favorite thing about Mid-Autumn Festival his year, I ad a boring Mid-Autumn Festival. But I'll tell you something interesting about it. My favorite thing is playing [vp2,1-1] lantern. At first, I design some pieces of paper, [wd4,1-1]  cut them in different shape[np5,2-0]. After doing it, I use my colourful-pens [fm2,-]to drawing[vp6,1-4] plenty of cute animal and people[np5,6-0] on the paper. Then, it become[vp3,1-0] a lantern. But it's not enough. I have to use some iron-wire to make it firm. Then, I light a candle and let it stand in the lanton [fm1-]. It's a read[fm1,-],beautiful lantern. [sn9,-]  it often takes me one and a half hour to make it. Ok, I go out to the street with my lanton[fm1,-].  I have a good time.  In Mid-Autumn [fm3,-]  festival,[wd4,s-] I like most is the food, including fruits and moon-cakes [fm2,-].If there is[vp8,2-0] something else, that must be he peanut and sugar. Everything in Mid-Autumn seems very special, and the food[np6,1-0]  also seems attractive. So we always eat little before that night in order to have more delicious food from[pp1,4-] the Mid-Autumn Festival. Among the food I like most is the chestnut. Since we seldom [fm1,-] eat this, it tastes more delicious than the others. But we just bought a little, so we divided them into six pile[np6,1-0]each pile has just two or three grain. [sn1,s] So it seems very limited and we couldn't help buying another one. Though we got[wd7,0-8] very little[wd7,0-1] thing for the Mid-Autumn, we spend it with our classmates in [pp1,0-3] the champus[fm1,-]. We also play several games. Funny and enjoyable.	What is my favorite thing about[wd3,-] Mid-Autumn Festival? Let me think. Moon cakes? Oh, I don't think that is my favorite. Because very year I ate moon cakes. when[fm3,-]I was a child, I liked mooncakes .Because it was tasty and also because I can only eat mooncakes once a year[sn2,s-]. But as time went by[sn2,s-]. In every year we have mooncakes to eat, and almost all the mooncakes were the dame. There were[vp3,1-3] a little[wd3,0-3] change, almost the same shape, the same content. I don't know how to say the thing which mooncakes made[vp7,1-1] of. But I can say many mooncakes are made of the same kind of food and sometimes there is a egg in it. So, these years I don't eat mooncakes a lot. Perhaps the most favorite [wd3,1-1]  thing is to go out and carry a lantern in the street and play with friends. That's exciting. 	This year, I had a happy Mid-Autumn Festival.  But, I'll tell you something interesting of my childhood holiday. My favourite thing is playing [vp2,1-1]  lantern. I used to make lantern by myself. First , I designed some pieces of paper, [wd4,1-0]  cut them in different shape. Then, I used my colourful [wd2,-1] pens and drew plenty of cute animal and people[ np6,6-1]  on the paper. After [pr1,-]  it, I glued the paper in a certain shape. Sometimes it liked[wd2,1-1] pumpkin, sometimes liked[wd2,1-1] horse. It became a lantern. But it's not enough. I have to use some steel-wire to make it firm. Then I light a candle and let it stand in the lantern. It was a beautiful one. It often took me one and a half hour to make it. Ok, I went out to the street with my favorite lantern and with my friends. All the lanterns light the street brilliant[wd2,2-0] and they liked[wd2,1-1] shinning star[np6,1-2]. I had a good time.   	Mid-Autumn [fm3,-]  festival is one of the most important occassion in Chian[fm1,-]. In that day, all the families will get together, and in evening, we will have a delicious meal. I always enjoy this feeling ---all family [np3,1-] eat and talk together. This is very pleasure[wd2,1-0].when fm3,-] the moon appears in the sky, we will go our[fm1,-]to watch the moon and eat moon cakes. I like many things, such as moon cake, the fruits which belong to mid-autumn festival. When I was a little girl, I would go out to play lanterns and games with my friends. we[fm3,-] would hold the lanterns and wanted [wd7,0-2] the street. We also guessed a riddle, which is a traditional game in China. The game is very interesting, but I am not good at it. The moon cake is my favorite food. It tastes sweet.   Even though the eggs in it is very good[sn2,s-].   	This mid-autumn [fm3,-] festival[fm3,-] was my second time not staying at home. I couldn't enjoy the meal at home. So I must find some games for myself. at[fm3,-] that night, I went out with my roommates and neighbours. We took much food and fruit and found a piece of spacious space to play our games,when [fm3,-]  we enjoyed the food and fruit, we play game[vp6,6-0] . The first is[vp6,4-0] charades. it is[vp6,3-] so interesting that we enjoyed it. At last, it got more and more difficult, we couldn't guess, so we gave up and went on to other game[np6,1-0] --- imitation. One person performed some guestures[fm1,-], other imitated. It was so funny that we couldn't help laughing. We also played the game --- "Two men and three feet". It was so difficult to walk that I hardly[wd3,6-2] fell down. But ,owing to our effort, we won the first place. The reward was moon cake and fruits. After the exciting games, were so tired that we slept sound[wd2,1-0]. The result was that we forgot to see the lunar-eclipse[fm1,-]. IT was so regretable[fm1,-].    	I like Mid-Autumn Festival, especially the moon, and the mooncakes. At that night, you can see a bright round moon in the blue sky. And I like eating the delicious mooncakes while I enjoying[vp9,1-1] the big moon. Besides, I love stayingwd7,03-] with my family, eating my favorite foods and tasty fruits. But this day, I had to stay at school, looking at the moon with my classmates. We also had a good time at[pp1,0-2]  that night. We played all kinds of games, laughing, singing. It's my favorite part of the festival. Then when [wd4,s-] went back to our dormintory[fm1,-], we saw a lot of students. They were helding[vp6,1-0] a party. To have a party is very popular in[pp1,0-2] our compus[fm1,-] . We can talk with everyone. , play with each other.when [fm3,-] we were in our room, I found everybody had a great smile on [pr1,6-1]  their faces. Oh, smiling was my favorite thing on  mid-Autumn[fm3,-]Festival.   	Mid-Autumn Festival was September 16th this year. It was always raining on this date in the last few years, but it is[vp6,18- 1] pleasure this year. Mooncakes, lamps [wd3,-] are all symbols in[pp1,0-3] this special day. My favorite thing in it[wd7,1-1] is moon-cake, of course it is delicious, [sn9,-] Everyone in China like[vp3,3-0] eating mooncake and it is a traditional food to[wd7,0-1] nowaday. Last week I spend[vp6,2-0] the whole Mid-Autumn night with my roommate, eating moon-cake[fm1,-] and playing game. What a wonderful evening!   	August 15 in Chinese calendar is the happiest day in our country.  All the members in our families got together. My father, mother, brother and I[sn2,s-]. I think the favorite thing of mine is to see all of us get together and have a wonderful dinner. Because the dinner was very rich we all ate it up. The chicken, the duck and the fish were so dilicious[fm1,-] . I like the dinner my mother makes. She always makes the delicious food and make us water for it. Before the dinner, mother must[wd3,-s] make a good preparation for it. First, she must[wd3,-s]  get up earlier[aj3,0-2] to go to market buy[vp1,3-0] the flesh[fm1,-] vegetable, fish and son on, then bring them back and cook. She is a very good cook. I like spend[vp1,1-0] the Mid-Autumn Festival with my family sitting at the table with a lot of deliciou[fm1,-] food on it. 	Mid-Autumn Festival is a traditional day in China. on[fm3,-]  this day, many people who go[vp6,0-8] out [pr3,3-0]  his home or [pr3,2-0]  his hometown will come back to meet [pr3,7-0]  his family to have a good time. On this special day, there are lots of food to celebrate it, such as fruit: orange, pear and so on; mooncase [fm1,-] ,mooncase [fm1,-] is my favorite food on the day. I remember when I was a little child, my family lived in a small poor town. I had no chance to eat the mooncase [fm1,-] because of the poverty but just to imagine it.[sn8,s] my[fm3,-] mother always comforted me and did[wd3,-s]  a thing like mooncase[fm1,-] for me to eat. I thought it tasted good just like the mooncase [fm1,-]. After the opening-policy[np1,-], our country economics develops rapidly. There are all kinds of mooncase [fm1,-] for us to eat.  My favorite thing on [wd3,1-1]the day is that on the night [cc1,-1]evening, all the fellow-villagers [fm1,-]in two uiversities [fm1,-]came together. My own feeling, since in our university, I can't always meet my fellow-villages, I miss them and miss my hometown, my family[sn5,s]. Spend[vp1,0-6] the happy night with them, I can relax myself and enjoy my lesiie [fm1,-] . sitting together with them, I forget all the burden of study, just enjoyed [vp6,7-0] everything. With nothing to worry about, the traditional food, it remained [wd3,-][vp2,-2]me about my family, my kind father, my mother and my three elder sister [np3,2-0].They all treated me nicely. Also, I felt as if I had come back home andspending [vp5,4-0] the night with them.	My most memorable Mid-Autumn Festival Night was the Mid-Autumn Festival night last year. Last MidAutumn [fm1,-] festival [fm3,-] night, I wasn't at home to spend the Festival with my family for the first time, but spent[vp6,12- 0] it with my classmates in[pp1,0-2]  the campus. I can't forget that night. I was still taking[wd3,03-] military training on that day. At night we need'ttake [wd3,2-2] military training because of the Festival. I went to the campus with my classmates and wanted to find some of my fellow students.when [fm3,-] I was on the way, I saw a lot of people with their family [np3,1-0] walking around and chatting. Some little children held a lantern [np3,5-0] intheir hand [np3,1-0] laughing and playing. All of these made me think of my family. At that time how I wanted to cry. I had never left my family on Mid-Autumn Festival. This was the first time that I wasn't at home at [wd3,0-3] such a special night and no mooncakes, no special things to eat. [sn8,s]SO I can't forget the last Mid-autumn [fm3,-] Festival night. My favorit [fm1,-] thing about Mid-Autumn [wd4,-] is mooncake.I think it tastes delicious. Every  Mid-Autumn day I would eat a lot of them and of course I eat too much and it always make me feel pain in my throat. But I don't mind because I love to eat them so much. Though there are so many other food in[wd3,0-2] Mid-Autumn day which can be eaten y us, I think the most delicious food is mooncake. But my parents and my little brother don't love them every [fm1,-] much. They just love to eat fruit, and [wd5,1-2] peanut or other food my mother cooks. Of course, the food my mother cooks tastes delicious too, I don't eat it more [wd7,2-0] , I just eat the mooncake. But sometimes when I get a sore throat, I have to stop eating them and have to take medicine. Oh, what can I say. Perhaps sometimes [wd5,-s]  I will not eat mooncake any more. I just get a lot of harm from eating mooncake, so now I have made up my mind not to eat more [wd5,-s] mooncake and change to eat other food, [sn8,s]such as fruit [np6,-s] and peanut [np6,-s]. The mooncake has different shape[np6,1-0], round and[sn2,s]  	The Mid-Autumn festival [fm3,-] is celebrated on the night of August,15th according to the Chinese Lunar Calendar. People stay [wd3,-s] together and eat moon cakes while looking at the bright full moon. In my hometown, one of the four famous towns in Song Dynasty in ancient China, there is a special parade. That's my most favourite thing. On that night, there would be a lot of people standing along the main roads of he city to watch the parade. Many floats are dressed by colorful belts and cloth on which written some patterns concerned with some historical stories. On the top of the floats, there are historical characters presenting famous historical stories, fabulous.  	Mid-Autumn Festival is a joyous day, because  had a good time n that night. First, I enjoyed myself with delicious food, [,-s]  for example, mooncake [np6,0-2] of several kinds, fresh fruits. Maybe, they are quite simple and common, but on that special night I liked them .[,s] Most of all, I think, is that I stayed with others to share the good time. Usually, we looked at the round moon, played some kind of games, talked about the mysterious legends, etc. So I can tell you that my favourite thing on the day is the food, the night.    	Watching the changing moon while I was tasting some delicious food is the most wonderful things on mid-Autumn [fm3,-] festival [fm3,-] Night. I had known that I would have a chance to see the moon changing from a big bright round one to a dark one on[pp2,-2] the night. I sitted [vp9,-s]  quietly and waited [vp1,0-3] patiently the appearance of the terrific sign. At about two o'clock, the moon changed little by little and at last became a complete one. Almost at the same time it suddenly turned into a bright one again. I have never seen[wd7,0-1]  the sign before, so I was very happy and excited at this. I had a wonderful time and missed those delicious food very much 	Mid Autumn festival [fm3,-] is a traditional day of China. I like Mid-Autumn Festival, because there are many delicious things to eat. , such as mooncakes and fruits. When I was a child, my grandfather always told me that[wd3, -s] story of[pp1,1-0] the moon on Mid-Autumn Festival. I always listened to y grandfather attentionly [fm1,-] , because the story was very attaractive [fm1,-]. My grandfather told me there was a fairy in [pp1,0-2] the moon who broke the law of the God. My grandfather also told me that there was a man called Wugang who was cutting the tree in [pp1,0-2] the moon. In [pp1, 0-2] that time, I believed him, and I liked the story and I also liked my kind grandfather.  	Mid-Autumn is a happy festival. On that night, I have many imagination about the ancient history, the rumor [wd7,-s], etc. But most of all I like the moon in [wd3,0-2] that night --- round, mild and mysterious. I'm attracted by her. Also, many kinds of food delicious mooncakes, favorite fruits, beautiful accassions [fm1,-] ,handed [wd7,0-1]  lamp, drinks, etc[sn2,s-]. Anyway, [fm3,-]  Food in [pp1,-2] that night is my favorite thing. As you know that [wd5,-s],mooncake has many kinds, a long history.[sn2,s] Nowadays many companies produce it. so [fm3,-] I have chance [np6,1-] to have have [wd6,-]a good taste to every kind. That's a beautiful mood. 	Mid-Autumn is the second most important Chinese traditional festival. During this important day, we do a lot of things. First of all, all the family members should to [fm1,-] back to their home no matter how far they were [vp6,11-] . Since it's a  reunion day[sn2,s-].  Next, people will prepare a lot of tasteful[wd2,-1]  food to celebrate this critical [cc4,-1]day and that my love. [sn8,s]For I like delicious food a lot [sn2,s-]. In that part, in the evening of that day, we whole family will sit together , with countless food plad [fm1,-]  on the table, enjoying the beautiful moonlight of that night. And we children will have a good luck [cc1,-3]of eating food. We eat all kinds f food, such as fruit mooncakes, snacks, drinks and so on. Especially he mooncake, that the essential food of every Festival [sn2,s-]. 	My favourite thing about Mid-Autumn Festival is the moon. The moon in Mid-Autumn festivsl [fm3,-] is very round and bright. That night my friends and I appreciate the moon eating moon-cake [fm1,-]  , many kinds of fruit [np3,3-],we had an enjoyable night. [sn1,s] The moon in the high [wd3,-2] sky with some bright stars around it, of course, it moon is the main character that we all appreciate,[sn8,s] [sn1,-s]  whenever [fm3,-]when [wd5,1-1] it's Mid-Autumn Festival night, the moon is the lovely [aj3,-3] thing of all, and it's the picture of the festival. I think, when looking at the moon, we people usually miss our family, relatives friends , but I feel it's a sweet memory[wd3,1-2] to miss our families, friends ect [fm1,-]can make you feel sad but mostly happy for you know she or he will miss you also.[sn8,s] 	Well, what is my favorite thing about Mid-Autumn Festival? I have no idea. Maybe some mooncakes, maybe some fruit, maybe some riversnails ect [fm1,-] . Which is my favorite? It [wd6,-1  Itseems nothing. After a wonderful, delicious meal,eating   some mooncakes, I'm full as the fullmoon [fm2,-]. I missed my family, my hometown, l my formal friends ect [fm2,-] . I just know I  am alone, a little lonely. Imagining the whole family was sitting around the table, happily talking, eating, smiling without me[sn2,s-]. So I visited my old friends for happiness. But it so happened that they were out. I felt depressed, staring [vp1,-3] the full moon. It was the only partner of mine .it [fm3,-] was so bright, [wd4,-s] full.  	My favorite thing bout [fm1,-]  Mid-Autumn Festival is eating . You can eat a large numble [fm1,-]  of fruits at that time just [wd7,-s] apples, etc. Apples are the popular thing in Chinese people's table, it always have [vp3,-]the meaning : eat a apple, you can get a lot. [sn1,s] Hamigua is a large fruit [cc4,1-]  we must eat it and cut it together. What a fun.  We sitting[vp9, 1-] under the moon and eat all kinds of fruits beside all kinds of fruit.[sn8,s] We also have mooncake to eat. Now the techinique [fm1,-] of making a mooncake has developed. So we can eat many favour [wd7,1- 2] of them such as icy] mooncake, fruit mooncake. What's my favorite thing about Mid-Autumn Festival? Let me think,.he moon, the mooncake or the amosphere [fm1,-] on the day. I don't know exactly. But maybe, maybe what? I don't know how to say. Hm, it's known to all that people will get together ith their families on that night and eat mooncakes, apples, ears etc. while sitting in front of the house and looking at he moon. So most people will go back home and stay with their family or friends the whole day. But very unfortunately, we couldn't go home on that day this [wd7,-2] two years, we only stayed at the dormitory last year,and in this year, we went our [fm1,-] with our classmates to find fun ourselves. [sn1,s] And we all had a good time that night. That night is hardly forgetable [wd2,-s]in my mind. We had so much fun that night and I felt too happy. I can't forget it.  Mid-autumn [fm3,-] Festival is a Chinese traditional festival or he whole family to meet together. Moon-cake [fm1,-] is my favorite thing in this festival. When I was a child, my family was in poor condition. Moon-cake [fm1,-]  was too luxurious for us. For [pp2,-2] that case, we were eager to spend this Festival because we would have the chance of eating a small piece of moon-cake [fm1,-] . From then one [fm1,-], moon-cake has become my most favorite thing in Mid-Autumn festival. Nowadays although we have enough money to buy the moon-cake at any time during the year, the moon-cake [fm1,-] in the d-Autumn Festival has full meaning and taste more delicious. Moon-cake [fm1,-] includes [wd3,-4] many kinds of ingredients, such as , peanuts, egg, meat and so on.[sn8,s]  Mid-Autumn Festival is one of the Chinese traditional festivals. On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the families will get together to share their pleasure and eat mooncakes [sn9,-]  grape [np6,1-] , banana [np6,1-] , apple [np6,1-] , etc. My favorite thing about mid-autumn [fm1,-] festival[fm3,-] is to go all round the house with a lighted lantern and a mooncake in my hand.  	The old people say that lantern can get rid of ghosts. So many children will play with it. In my hometown,of [fm1,-] you go around other people's house with a lighted lantern, the hostess will give you a gift. Then all the children will get together to sing, dance, [wd4,-s] play games. That's very fun.  When I read this topic "my [fm3,-] favorite thing about Mid-Autumn Festival", I couldn't help remembering this festival last Tuesday. That night I ate many things. I like to eat food. So I have no idea which I like best. Of course, the traditional food in [pp1,-2] that day is mooncake. To he [fm1,-] frank. I don't like eat [vp4,1-] sweet food, because I hear people say sweet food can cause fat [wd2,-]. But at home, my mother always asked me,eat some [sn2,-s] . She has her reason  [sn2,-s] she said: "mooncake was made by Chang'er in the moon who is a pretty woman. If you eat it, you can be as beautiful as her [pr4,6-].  I'm happy to hear that, so I'll eat a bit every time, only a bit, as every girl always want [vp3,2-] herself to be a beautiful one. [sn1,s]There are many kinds of mooncake [np3,2-] . My favorite thing about Mid-Autumn Festival is fruits, all kinds of fruits instead of mooncake [sn2,-s] . In China, almost everyone eats mooncake during Mid-Autumn Festival time, because mooncake seems o be the most important things to this festival. But it is an exception to me. I eat mooncake, but I have never finish eating a completely [wd2,1-1] mooncake one time, no  mater [fm1,-] how tasty it is. But fruits [np5,-1]  is different. I like all kinds of fruits, such as apple pear, Hami melon, strawberry, grape, etc. I can mange [fm1,-] to eat a lot of fruit [np6,1-] at one time, and the more I eat, the more interests [wd7,-2] I raise [wd3,2-]  until I'm so full that I can't eat any more. 

< ST 5> <SEX 2> <y 10> <sch wsd> <AGE 20> <WAY 2><DIC 2> <TYP 2> 	My most memorable Mid-Autumn Festival night Usually, Mid-Autumn Festival night was all the same, full  of joy. But, I have a special night on that day.[,s] when [fm3,-] I was ten year [np6,1-] old, I was sent to [wd4,-1] countryside, stayed in[wd3,-] my uncle's. Approaching the Mid-Autumn Festival, I was still [wd7,6-] happy, but on that night, everything changed. When my favorite food were [vp3,1-]  set on [wd4,1-] table, everybody was ready to enjoy them [pr4,1-], I was sad at the sight of the moon, because I missed my family very much. So [wd5,-s] , at [wd5,-s] that night I was thinking about how lonely I was without my family around me to share the food night [wd7,-s] .Even [wd5,-s] tears came into my eyes. I couldn't tell how sorrow [wd2,-2] I was! Time flies, [sn9,-]  that night is still my most memorable d-Autumn Festival night.  I used to enjoy the Mid-autumn Festival night together with my parents. But [wd5,-s] this year, I  don't [fm1,-] . I have  [vp6,-s] stayed in the campus. Because I have  had [vp6,-s] an appointment with a young man with whom I almost fall [vp6,-s] in love[sn2,s-]. I was very excited [fm1,-] and a little nervous that night. I'd never made an appointment with a young man at night before. I'd never fallen in love with a man before. On that night, we sat by the west Lake in [pp1,-2] the campus, looking at the bright full moon [sn9,s-] talking. We talked about our childhood [np6,1-],  our present life [np6,2-] , our family members and Chinese literature about moon. To my joy, we are  [fm3,-] both keen on Chinese literature and we  have [vp6,8-] much in common. I wished my most memorable Maid-Autumn night [np1,-3]   would last for ever. The Mid-Autumn Festival of this year was the most memorable. In the past I spent the festival with my family at home. This year, I had to stay at our university and spent the night with y fellow villagers.  we [fm3,-] got together, talked freely and ate the traditional food. We talked about experience [np1,-2]  of life,  experience [np1,-2] of study and almost everything. The traditional food included moon-cakes [fm1,-] , fruits, peanuts and riversnails. Spending the whole night with them, I relaxed myself and forgot the burden of my study[np1,3-0].They all treatly [wd2,-1] me nicely. I felt as if I had come back home and stayed with my family. On that night, I enjoyed myself, enjoyed everything.  I will never forget that night --- the most happy [aj3,-1]Mid-Autumn Festival night in my life. It happened it was also my little niece's birthday. I decided to spoil her for the particular  occation [fm1,-]. I bought a large splendid  delicate [wd4,1-1] birthday cake. My sister-in-law had a gift for her two [fm1,-]. It was a surprise, she said. After having dinner, my family  were [vp3,1-] all sitting together watching TV. My niece looked sad and asked, Don't you think you forget something?" We pretended not to notice it. "Oh, yes, I forget to turn off the tap. " said my mother, smiling, and went to the kitchen. "Let me help you, mame." I excused myself into the kitchen. Then TWO large birthcake [np3,2-]  turned up. "Happy birthday to you, honey. " With tears in her eyes, the little thing gave each of us a kiss. We spent the night joyously, which I will remember forever. I will never forget that Mid-Autumn Festival Night. My friends and I went to climb Baiyun Mount to see the lunar eclipse. it [fm3,-] t was 12 pm and it was time for us to set off. We planned that we should arrive at the summit of the mount before 1 am. The bright moon hung in the sky . The breeze brushed trees as it they were singing pleasant songs. We were so excited that we climbed up to the top non-stop. Afterwards we sat down together eating mooncakes and watching the partial lunar  eclips [fm1,-] . When we watched the total lunar eclipse, l we could not help cheering. We had a good time that night. It was meaningful for us to see the lunar eclips [fm1,-]  at the Mid-Autumn Festival Night.  Everyone has his/her beautiful memory  about Mid-Autumn Festival night, for it is such a mice moment for Chinese people [np7,2-] , What's mine? Mine is eating moon-cake [fm1,-] and fruits and appreciating the round golden moon with my family. When I was young, I spent 15 such  night [np3,2-] at home with [wd4,-s] father, mother, brother and sisters. At [pp1, -3] that [np3,1-] happy occasion [np3,3-] ) my mama always told us stories about the moon, talks[vp6,6-]  about the Moon Goddess. Every year , the  story [np3,2-]  was [vp3,1-] different and attractive. But [wd5,-s] now I will never have such [wd4,4-] chance.My mother parted [wd3,-1] away and I always spend my Mid-Autumn Festival at school . Oh, My [fm3,-] memorable Mid- autumn [fm1,-]  Festival night [np3,3-] )is [vp3,1-] only in my memory.   	every [fm3,-] one has  spent [wd3,-3] many Mid-Autumn festival [fm3,-][np3,2-] and every one has their mot memorable one [np3, 7-] . So do I. My meroble [fm1,-]  mid-Autumn [fm3,-] festival  [fm3,-]  night [fm3,-] is the one of last year. It was the saddest and happiest one in my life. why [fm3,-] ? Because it was the fist time that I didn't spend  those [pr1,-1] festival with my family. I missed them very much and I felt sad. Fortunately, I made friends with five girls who came from different place [np3,1-]  of Guang Dong  we [fm3,-]  live in the same dormitory. That night we had a good time together. We bought many things to eat and played many games. We sang and danced . They knew me had strong homesick,[sn8,s]  so they tried to make me happy by telling a  lot of jokes. I will never forget mid-Autumn [wd6,-]mid-Autumn festival [fm3,-] night in 1996 in my life life.[wd6,-] 	Mid-Autumn Festival is one of our Chinese traditional festivals. People enjoy the festival very much, because almost all the embers of the family will get together and it is always very fun.I like this festival very much ,[sn9,-] my  [fm3,-] most memorable a [wd5,-s] Mid-Autumn Festival Night is the one two years ago.It's  [fm1,-] a exception [np7,-1] ,[sn9,-] for I selebrated [fm1,-] it with my friends near my house ,[sn9, -] carrying  [fm3,-] our lanterns, mooncakes [sn9,s-] fruit,[sn9,-]  and [wd5,s-][sn1,-s]  spent the whole night on the mountain playing games, watching the moon, [wd4,1-1]eating the food. It's [fm1,-] very fun [wd2,1-] to make a wish under the moonlight. The most laughable thing was that one of my friend [np3,2-] ate clay ,[sn9,-] instead of the mooncake,[sn9,-]because of the darkness. We slept for a while untill [fm1,-] dawn[sn2,s-]. Then we hurried off the mountain to go to school. It was very excited [aj4,-s], and from that night, I realized that friends must share their trouble and joys [np3,-2] .   	Watching the changing moon on Mid-Autumn Festival Night is the most wonderful things while tasting delicious food. I had known that I would have a chance to watch the moon changing from a bright round one to a dark one ,[sn9,-]  on the night[pp1,2-]. I waited patiently for the appearance of the grant [fm1,-] sight.  at [fm3,-] about 2 'clock, the moon changed into a smaller and smaller NEW MOON. Suddenly [sn9,-] it became a  complete [wd2,-1] dark one. Almost at the same time it became a NEW MOON again. Little by little it turned [vp1,-s]  a round one. I have ever seen the grant [fm1,-] sight before. I was very excited at this. I had a wonderful time and missed [wd3,-s]  those delicious  food [np3,2-] very much. 	I  can't [fm1,-] forget that Mid-Autumn Festival night which I spent with my university colleagues. As a rule, people spend that night with their families, but I have to leave my mice [fm1,-] family for university. For the first Mid-Autumn Festival at university, we had prepared the delicious fruits and some mooncakes --- the two things we  can't [fm1,-] lack for such a traditional festival. At 8. 00 P. M, we lighted a lantern to keep the evil spirits away. The most memorable thing during that night was playing charades with my colleagues [wd3,-s] . From the Family  AIbumn [fm1,-] U. S. A. we should [wd3, -1] play American games on such a Chinese traditional festival. Though not staying with my family at that time, I felt at home because of such a enchanted night. I'd [fm1,-] never had so memorable Mid-Autumn Festival.  Sometimes thing may  go on beyond your belief and  thus [wd2,-s] was what happened to me last Mid-Autumn Festival. Last year, I became a college student. Needless to say, I felt proud and delighted. At the same time, I was also scared and a bit down --- I would have to live alone without my family. As the Festival drew upon, I felt more upset. I was sitting alone in my room and listening  sadly [ad1,1-1] to the noisy and joyous sound [np6,s-]  outside that night when there was a knock on the door. "Who is it?" I asked. There was no answer. I opened the door and could see a box of  mooncake [np3,2-] on the doorstep. I went out looking around, but could see nobody. Puzzled, I turned back. To my great surprise, my best friend, Xiaohui, was in the middle of the room. She had travelled a long way to be with me. Smiling, she said "Happy Mid- autumn [fm1,-] Festival. " I will never forget that Mid-Autumn.  My most memorable Autumn Festival Night is the one that just passed. It's [fm1,-] on Tuesday last week that the Autumn Festival  met [wd7,-s], my [fm3,-] friends and I enjoyed a happy night. It's [fm1,-] the first Autumn Festival that I spent in college, it's [fm1,-] very special[fm1,-] , I felt. I followed my friend to her relative's home in order to have a  delcious [fm1,-] supper. Before we arrived there, they had prepared all the dishes, they're  [vp6,5-] of many delicious kinds. We enjoyed the supper and had a very happy time.after [fm3,-] the meal, we can taste  many kinds of fruit [np3,2-] ,it's [fm3,-] the most favourite meal that I had in Guangzhou,  since [cj1,-s]  we  can't [vp6,5-] do anything but have meals from dinning hall, and every student complains of these bad meals including me [sn8,s-] . After we came back to our dormitory, my roommates and other people who lives [vp3,2-] as [pp1,-3] the same building   as we do enjoyed a very very happy night. we [fm3,-]layed [vp4,-]lanterns together and [wd5,-s] so [wd5,-s] so I can say last Autumn Festival Night is the most unforgettable one!This year's Mid-Autumn Festival gave some memorable things to me ,[sn9,-] it was a wonderful day. So [wd5,-s] my [fm3,-] roommates and other new friends were together playing some wonderful and enjoyable games, but the most important thing is that I had chance to get to know new friends. And [wd5,-s] I could eat my favourite food, such as moon cakes [fm1,-] , fruit, etc. Although I couldn't [fm1,-] come back to my house  always missed my family and my lovely dog.[sn8,s] I could only give my parents a call, but I can't [wd3,-s] feel depressed. Because I don't [fm1,-]try it [wd7,-s] befor [fm1,-] this year's Mid-Autumn Festival. Contrary, [sn2,s]this day is so wonderful for me. The beautiful moon was bright, and rose higher and higher. Having enjoyed ourselves, we started walking back, and arrived at midnight.   	August 15th, by Lunar Calendar, is the Chinese traditional festival. As a rule, the whole family gets together for a happy night. On that night, you can eat a lot of things, such as mooncakes, fruit, rivernail [fm1,-] ,  teak[wd7,-s] ect [fm1,-] . when [fm3,-] I left home, I spent the most lonely Mid-Autumn Festival Night, also it's y most memorable Mid-Autumn Festival. On that night I ate whatever I  want [vp3,4-] to. After a delicious meal, I'm [vp3,4-] full as the fullmoon. children were carrying lanterns for fun. I  had no mood in doing that thing. It was for babies [wd3,-s] , so I sat at my desk le. Just at that moment I realized I was alone in a strange city. Imagining the whole family sitting around the table happily, I felt a little upset. I really missed them all. Thinking the past time I spent with my former friends, I felt like visiting them. Unfortunately, It [fm3,-]  so happened that they were out. My loneliness was getting more and more [wd4,-s] ,[sn9,-] Starrng [fm1,-] at the full moon. It was my only partner on such a  only [fm1,-] Mid-Autumn Festival.  	Do you spend your Mid-Autumn Festival Night in The[fm3,-] same way like me?[sn2,s] I always spent [vp6,-s]that night with my family. We often sat together in front of the house, talking [vp1,-1] everything, eating things,  but [wd5,-s] ,on the most memorable Mid-Autumn Festival Night, I was alone. On that night I could see the lunar eclipse so I would never forget it. Around [pp2,-s] midnight, the moon became the roundest and the lightest [wd3,-s] on [pp1,-2] that night. Later, the moon became darker. At about one o'clock, the lunar eclipse began, and we could only [wd5,-s] see most part of it, [sn9,-] and  [wd5,-s] we [fm3,-] could less of it later on. Almost [ad1,-1] at three 'clock, we could no longer see the moon. Since we can't [fm1,-] see the next lunar eclipse until sixty-years later, it's [fm1,-]  worthy [wd3,-s] seeing it.I can't [fm1,-] forget that night for I have [vp6,2-] the chance of watching it.  I spent most [aj3, 1-] memorable Mid-Autumn Festival night when I was in he junior middle school. It's [vp6,6-] the first time that I hadn't [vp6,-s] stayed with my family during the Mid-autumn Festival night. It happened that the day was Saturday, and almost all the residents far away from home stayed in school.I missed my family very much, because it was the traditional festival for Chinese family to stay [wd3, 1-] together.  But[wd5,-s] I was a one and I had no moon-cake [fm1,-] . TO my surprise, one day students carried their on-cake [fm1,-]  and fruits to my dormitory. I couldn't help crying, because they were so thoughtful and so kind. That night we played till midnight, singing, dancing and talking. That night was so pleasurable that I will keep it in my mind for ever.  Mid-Autumn Festival is a Chinese traditional festival. On that night, children like to go out lighting?) a beautiful lantern [np3,8-] . when [fm3,-] I was a little girl, I also liked to [wd4, -1]so with other children in our big yard. My most memorable Mid-autumn Festival night was the night when I was  eight-year [fm1,-]  [np3,1-] old. after [fm3,-]  having supper, I went out lighting a lantern which I liked very much. With my little good friends, I came to the Dongjinag river bank and saw some people playing firecrafts [fm1,-] . It was so interesting that I was attracted. Suddenly, a "rocket" flied [fm1,-] to me. I was frightened and threw away my lantern. Certainly, it burnt. Being unable to light a lantern, I returned home crying sadly. Until my mother promised me to buy a more beautiful one for me the next year did I stop crying. [sn8,s]It was a pity that I couldn't [fm1,-] let my lantern hang in the balcony through that night. And [wd5,-s] it was so unforgetable and memorable.  The Mid-Autumn Festival night of this year was my most memorable night . What a beautiful night! The full moon was hanging high up in the wide sky. The breeze was blowing gently. My friends and I brought all kinds of food [np3,2-] , fruit [np3,1-] and cold drink to the lawn, where [pr1,-s] were already full of happy people, to celebrate the special night. We also bought 2 beautiful lanterns, but one of them was burned a hole because the lighting candle in it was tilted [wd3,-]. What a pity! But [wd5,-s] when we saw that, we couldn't laughing [vp6,-s] and thought it was unforgettable. Moreover, when we opened 2 bottles of Pepsi-Cold, the drink [wd3,-2] in them spurted our faces suddenly, [sn9,-] we [fm3,-] looked at each other and convulsed with laughter. How fun [wd2,1-] it was! While we were appreciating the most bright [aj3,-1] full moon in this year, we were enjoying all kinds of delicious things we bought [vp6, s] , talking, singing and dancing like any other people. Then [wd5,-s] we spent a happy night. For me, it also was my most memorable Mid-Autumn Festival night.  Last year I entered South China Normal University. During the first month, I had to have military training, and my family  is [vp6,8-] far away from University, so I had to spend the Mid-Autumn Festival night without my parents  [wd4,3-] but  my roommates for the first time in my life. It was my most memorable Mid-Autumn Festival night. On that night, after bathing myself, I went to the compus [fm1,-] to enjoy the beautiful, round moon with my roommates. when [fm3,-] we were walking around, I saw a lot of people strolling and chatting with their families, their children holding a lantern [np3,3-] in their hands laughing or running around them. I also saw some people sitting on the grassland eating fruit and mooncakes [np6,-s] and enjoying the bright moon.  All of these reminded me of my parents and the happy time I spent with my families [np5,-s] on Mid-Autumn Festival night. At that time, I had an impulse to cry, but, in the presence of my roommates and other people I tried my best to hold back my tears of sadness. This was the first time I wasn't[fm1,-] at home on such a special night and had no lanterns, no mooncakes and [cj1,1-1] other special things in season to eat. what [fm3,-] I had was he happy memories. I can't forget the mid-Autumn Festival night of 1996.  Last year, I spent a special Mid-Autumn Festival night here. before [fm3,-] I entered university, I spent all my Mid-autumn [fm3,-] festival  [np3,-3]  at home. But last year,  I left my parents and enter[vp6,4-] university. Because my house [wd3,-s] is far way from here and we were having a military training at that time [sn9,-]  I had to stay here on the Mid-Autumn Festival. At [pp1,-2] that night, we  got  two apples each one [sn8,s-] . The apples were large and red. The moon was full and bright. Roommates [np4,-2] and I went out walking . Since [wd3,-s] we didn't know each other very well, [sn9,-]  and still were strange [wd3,-s] to our campus, we had a lovely time.It's [fm1,-] the first time I had spent [vp6,-s] the mid-Autumn Festival with strange classmates instead of my parents. Also It's [fm1,-] the first step I became inddepent[fm1,-]. It gave me a special memory. That's [fm1,-]my most memorable Mid-Autumn Festival Night. I always spent my Mid-Autumn Festival with my family [sn9,-]  But this year, I entered the university, I have[vp6,3-] to spend my Mid-Autumn Festival with my friends. On that night I had a good time. The moon was very round and bright and the sky was blue. Our campus was full of laughter. I was invited to a party with my friends. We went to the grass-land [fm1,-] to see the beautiful moon. and [wd5,-s] we [fm3,-] had all kinds of food [np3,2-] food to eat [sn9,-]everyone [fm3,-] enjoyed it. we [fm3,-] talked about the original tradition.  [fm3,-] we also played games.what  [fm3,-] a good time we had!  The last Mid-Autumn Festival night was  significant. There as lunar eclipse in that night. The moon in [pp2,-2] that night was the highest [wd3,3-][sn9,s-] the biggest and the roundest in this centry[fm1,-]. That lunar eclipse was the most marvelous one of those [pr1,-1] centry[fm1,-].It appeared at the [wd5,1- 1] mid-night, so e fm1,-] didn't go to bed to [wd3,-s] watch the process [wd7,-s] of it for it was really a good chance. Before it appeared the lunar eclipse the earth was covered with silver. The moon was so big, so bright that we could see the palace in it. After that,more and more [wd7,-2] the moon was eaten, [sn9,-] and the earth became darker and darker. At last, the moon was eaten up, all the world became a piece of dark[cc1,3-]. We even couldn't see each other. After a while, the moon struggled to show itself out. First it looked liked a boat, then half  an cake [np7, 1-]  [wd4,s-] at last it was a full moon. The earth was covered with silver again And [fm3,-] we could see each other again. How fun the last Mid-Autumn Festival night was. It was unforgetable [fm1,-] . The Mid-autumn [fm3,-] Festival I spent this year is [wd4,-1]most memorble[fm1,-].it [fm3,-] was my first time to spend such a special night leaving home [sn8,s]. At [pp1,-1] night, we had a party on the playground. We danced, sang, told stories and ate the typical food for this festival--- mooncakes and lots of delicious fruits as we appreciating [vp9,2] the beautiful full moon. The most unforgettable thing we did in the party was burning firecrackers. The light that the burning firecrakers [wd3,-s] gave out looked so beautiful in the dark night that we all cheered excitedly. I enjoyed myself very much at [pp1,-2] that night. What's [fm1,-] more, I've got got closer with my classmates since that night[sn8,s-]. In a word, I will never forget that wonderful Mid-Autumn Festival night.  There was a little difference in this year's Mid-Autumn Festival, because I spent it with my room-mates in Guangzhou far away from  myhometown. at [fm3,-] first, I thought I would be lonely,  but I changed my thought at last. That evening, we enjoyed the moon , singing songs and dancing. My favorite thing in Mid-Autumn Festival is moon-cakes [fm1,-] , [sn1,-s] since it is delicious, I like to eat so much at a time. On that night, I ate too much to eat anything else. This was the first time I spent the special night without my family, but it is [vp6,9-] really wonderful and memorable, isn't [vp6,5-] it?  I always spend [vp6,-10] my MA [wd7,-1] Festival Night[wd7,-s]  with my family. But this time is the special one, I spent it with my classmates instead. Since then, it was [vp6,-]the most memorable night for me. At first, we just stayed at the dormitory eating some food. Later, we went out to the champus [fm1,-] and decided to play a [np7, 1-] game  [np3, -s] . About fifteen classmates took part in the games we planned. These games included charades and walking compete [wd2,-1] by tighting [wd2,-2] one foot of one person with that of another, then [cj1, s-] made a pair [wd7, -2] with three feet.SO [wd5,-s] it's difficult for the [wd7,-s] to walk straight. We always fell down because of uncooperation [fm1,-]. So [wd5,-s] it made great fun not only to [pp1,-1] ourselves but also to [pp1,-1]  the people sitting around us. Though the games were silly and not fashionable today, we all enjoyed ourselves. We spent the night, eating , playing and also [wd5,-s] laughing. The Mid-Autumn Festival night was different this year. For the first time I spent this night at school. Because I was missing [vp6,-s]  my family. I was in a little low [wd7,-2]. Suddenly I heard laughing [wd3,-s] around me. It was my classmates who were going to have a party. I joined them. At [pp1,-2] the playground we talked, singed [fm1,-] and enjoyed the bright , round moon. The moon-cakes [fm1,-] seemed to be specially delicious because of our happiness. then [fm3,-] we played charades. It was the most exciting part of the night. We forgot he time. it was almost midnight before we knew it. This Mid-Autumn Festival night is the most unforgetable [fm1,-] and I'll keep it in my mind for ever.    	Mid Autumn [fm1,-] Festival Night, [sn9,-] in [wd5,-s] this year,  is memorable. It was a special and happy night. This year I spent the Mid Autumn [fm1,-] Festival Night at school instead of at home. I missed my family and felt lonely. TO my suprise [fm1,-] ,  things were not as bad as I had thought.At [pp1,-2] that night many of my classmates and I went out to enjoy the round and bright moon. We held a happy party. the [sn2,-s] [fm3,-] fruits that we brought at [wd5, -] that night. We played interesting games, such as charades and "two men three feet". When we played "two men three feet", some pairs [fm1,-] couldn't cooperate well and they almost fell on the ground. The games made us laughed [vp1,2-]  all night. All of us had a good time. The Mid Autumn [fm1,-]Festival Night in [wd5, -1] this year will be in my memory for ever.   Mid- [fm1,-] autumn festival is a traditional occasion [wd3,-s] in China. People attach important [wd2, 1-1] to it. Before [pp1,-2] several weeks, they prepare for it. They will visit old friends and  relations with moon cakes [fm1,-] moon to keep [wd3,-2] their friendship. When I as a little girl, my gramma [fm1,-] would tell e the story about the moon. We sat [vp6,9-]  outside and watched [vp6,20-] the moon. Gramma [fm1-] told [vp6,8-] me that there are [vp3,-1] a beautiful lady whose name is chang'er and her servant Wugang in the moon. and [wd5, -s] Chang'er is accompanied by a beautiful rabbit. n ancient [wd4,2-] a beautiful young lady didn't want o get old, so she stole some lixins [fm1,-] and took them [wd4,2-]. TO her surprise, she became a fairy and flied [fm1,-] to the moon. Now, he is in charge of the moon. In id- autumn [fm3,-] festival [fm3,-], you will see Waging cut a tree and the rabbit superintending [fm1,-]  him. Each time, my gramma told me e same story, but I was attaracted [fm1,-] by it.  There are many memories of Mid-autumn [fm3,-] Festival in my brain [wd3,-s] .but [wd5,-s] the most memorable thing is eating moon cake this year. You must be surprise. Why is that? After supper at [pp1,-2] that night, my family were sitting [vp3,1-] around the table and watching the moon.  we [fm3,-] were happy in [pp1, 1-] eating fruits and having jokes.when [fm3,-]  we saw the whole round moon, my father said: " lets [fm1,-] eat moon cake. " My cousin gave me one. I was so excited that I ate it immediately. But I was treated [wd3,-s] . The moon came[fm1,-] was not [wd4,1-1] usual  one, it was made my by [wd1,2-0] cousin. She put some pepper in it. Of course, I didn't know  [wd4,1-]. After eating a little, my eyes and nose were running. Oh, I was liked [wd2,1-2] a clown at that time, red eyes and red nose. My family laughted [fm1,-]  and I laughed too. Although I was treated [wd7,-s] .[sn9,-] I didn't mind. It was one of my family's games. We all like [vp6,8-] to have fun. I had a happy night in [pp1,-3] Mid-Autumn Festival. 

<ST 5> <SEX 1> <y 10> <sch wsd> <AGE 20> <WAY 2><DIC 2> <TYP 2>   	Have you ever experienced that in [pp1,-2] the night of Mid-Autumn Festival, you are "lost" in the city that you were been in? The night when I experience [vp6,7-] all these [pr1,-s] is the most memorable Mid-Autumn festival [fm3,-] night to me. As I can remember, I went out by bike with my friends to enjoy the occasion and we all had fun. When it was time for us to go back home, we realized in a sudden that we had left our bicycles somewhere we must couldn't [vp9,-] remember! There was really a problem because without the bicycles, we could hardly go back home which was so far away from here. We et out to find them, in [pp1,-1] eagerness and anxiety, but all in vain. Now, I should say we were all "lost" in the city we were so familiar with and what was worse was that we had to walk a long way to find our homes! That is really memorable to me.  That day sep [fm1,-] , 16, was my most memorable day. It was the mid-Autumn [fm3,-] Festival. What I had done not only [sn8,-s]looking  at moon but talking to my friends . we [fm3,-] sat under the moon and talked [vp1,-s] all kinds of things. One of my friends told me the funny things of her family, her funny nieces younger brother and the other told us many stories about the moon. And [wd5,-s]  in [pp1,-2]  that night say [vp6,-s]  that that was the scene [np7,-2]  which could not be seen in [pp1,-3] two hundred years in that night we talked freely ate freely laughed freely; [sn9,-] what [fm3,-] a happy night we have [vp3,-s] !   	Do you want to spend the Mid-Autumn Festival with [wd3,-2] a new way, instead of having moon cakes, appreciating the sight of moon, moving around with the lanterns --- such traditional ways? Yes? why [fm3,-] not hold a party with your friends to celebrate this mavollours [fm1,-] night. recently [fm3,-] , I  got [wd3,-s] such a night. That night, a party to welcome the freshman 97' to our department was held, on the top of the eight-floor [fm2,-]high Art Building. Some of our teachers, the officers who were in charge of the military training of the freshman, and the main role of the party --- the freshman who just came into the campus this month, receiving [wd3,-3] the military training, were invited. A game named "Finding your friends" made a good beginning for the party. Some freshmen and teachers enjoyed the game. the [fm3,-] freshmen shown [fm1,-]  heir activation [wd7,-s] . when [fm3,-] another game began and the officers were invited to take part in, the freshmen became very excited. They shouted, giving their courage [wd3,-s] and support to the officers ; they laughed, sharing the fun their officers gave to them. The air was full of happiness. Also, the freshmen played games with the officers. What a sight! The party included in a song together. [sn8,s]Although that night has gone, it has left me marvelous memory.  

<ST 5> <SEX 2> <y 10> <sch wsd> <AGE 20> <WAY 1><DIC 2> <TYP 2>  	Now I 'm 20 years old and have experience [wd2,1-] a lot. There have been so many things happened: something interesting, something moving . . . Till now, I can't forget one of my moving experiences. 	At that time I was in primary school and I had a very good friend named John. We got on quite well. : study [vp5,-s]  together and play [vp5,-s] together. But one time, we quarreled about something and both of us cried. And then we didn't talk with each other. 	Several weeks later, I was ill seriously[ad1,1-] and didn't go to school for a month. During this month, nearly all of my classmates visited me and every day they brought a tape  in which recorded what the teachers had taught.[sn2,s] I so appreciated them, especially for recording the tape. John didn't come to visit me and I never wished she would, But then I found out that it was her [pr4,-s] who recorded the tapes everyday for me. Furthermore, she was a little ill, too [wd5,s-], but she insisted doing it for me. I was moved to tears when I knew that and made it up as soon as I could. 	Don't you think the experience is moving? John and I are good friends till now. 	When I was six years old,  once I found my mother's purse lying on the table. I had a strong desire [wd3,s-] and took some money out it. I didn't feel right about it, but I did [wd4,s-]. I brought [fm1,-] some candies with the money and shared them with my friends. 	When I came back home, I found mother very angry. She asked if I had stolen the money. I was frightened and lied that it might be taken [vp6,1- 1] by my sister. Hearing it, mother went to find my sister. I was so afraid that I hid myself in a room for storage. 	It was lunch time. I was very hungry, but I didn't dare to go out. I knew that my parents were looking for me everywhere and they must be very angry. In the afternoon' I was found, too frightened to speak. To my surprise, my mother didn't scold me, but kept asking "Are you OK? Are you hungry?' I was moved to tears "I am sorry, mum!' I couldn't hold back my tears but [wd3,-s] just cried. I knew I did the wrong thing and told lies, too. 	Always there are something or somebody made you moved, and which you'll never forget no matter they are sweet or bitter. August 14, 1995 is a day that I'll never forget. At that time, I just finished the examination of entering [np2,3-] the University and waited for the notice. Just on that day, one of my friend [np3,3-] called and told me that I dropped [vp6,-s] out the university not because of my point [wd3,-s] in the examination but of some mistakes made by the admissions [wd3,-s] . Oh no! I had done very well in the examination and I've got more [wd1,-2] 100 points than the points set[wd7,-s] set for the university. I had thought that I would surely enter the university. Now my dream have become [vp6,-s] water. How could I stand [wd3, s-] . I cried out. I didn't want my family to feel bad about me and I didn't want to see their disappointing face [np3,2-] . So I left home to one of my friends home the next day. I spent more than 10 days with my friend and when I came back, I found that my parents lost [vp6,-s] weight a lot [wd1,2-] and they looked older than before. I got confused and wondered what had happened at home. Later I  got to know that they haven't [vp6,-s] gone  [wd3,-s] to sleep for several days because they were worries [wd2,1-]  about me and tried to ask  for the [wd5,-s] information about my university entering [cc1,1-] . After knowing that , I got shock [np7, 1-] . Because they never asked about my study and my life and my future before  and when I asked them for advice, they only said 'decide it by yourself'. [sn1,s]I had  doubt [vp6,-s]whether I was their daughter. By then, I knew they've been loving me, only they are not good at expressing their emotion and tried to make me independent. I went up and hug [vp6,-s] them with teas [fm1,-] . 	When I was 15 years old, I went to visit my aunt who lives [vp6,-s] in a city far away from Canton. It's [vp6,-10]  the first time I have travelled [vp6,-s] along  [wd3,1-]. 	The day on which I left, I thought my parents would see me off. But my father insisted that I should go to the train station by myself. At that time, I felt my father was so cool [wd3,-3]. he [fm3,-] didn't care of [vp1,1-] me anymore. So when I came back, I didn't expect that my father would pick me up. I still remembered it was raining when the train arrived at the station at 5:30 am. I was surprised to find that my father was watching [wd3,-s] for me in the cold wind on the platform, with the umbrella [np7,-1]. I ran t him the minute I saw him. I couldn't help bringing [wd3,-2] tears to my eyes. But father just smiled and patted my back, said [vp5,-s]: "I know you forgot [vp6,-s] to bring the umbrella. " ON our way home, he asked me about the journey. 	 Later, I realized the reason why father didn't see me off is [wd4,-s] he  want [vp6,-s] me to be independent. "Don't always depend on others. Nobody can campany [fm1,-] you forever!" My father taught me.  Three years ago, my leg was badly hurt in a car accident. As my parents were far away from me, I was going to suffer from  the loneliness and the great pain. However, my classmates prevented this from happening. 	At the first night I got in hospital, all my classmates came to my ward with many little presents. Furthermore, the monitor gave me a beautiful bottle, there were uncounted [wd3,-]colourful luky-stars [fm1,-] in it. She said to me: 'It's said that the lucy-stars [fm1,-]  will bring lucky [wd2,-s] . We make them for you and hope they will really bring you lucky. ' At that moment, I found most of my classmates' fingers were hurt. I held the bottle firmly, and was too excited to say a word. From then on, they came to visit me in turns. whenever [fm3,-] I had severe pain in leg, I held [vp8,7-] the bottle tightly. Then, the pain would became weaker and weaker [wd3,-s] .It was not only I but my classmates were contended [wd7,-s] against the pain. They were all supporting me. With the help of my classmates, I recovered quickly. 	Now, if someone asks me what's the most valuable thing in the world. I will answer, friendship, without hesitation! 	It's [fm1,-] a moving experience in my life. It happened when I came to the university for the first time. Being home-sick [fm1,-] and not used to the new surroundings, I got sick during the military training. 	I got a cold and a high fever on [pp1,-2] that morning. Lying on bed, I felt restless and lonely. Then someone came in and I saw that it was our instructor. There was a reassuring smile on her face. ' What's the matter with you?' she said kindly. I told her that I had a fever and she touched my forehead. 'Don't worry. I'll send you to the hospital'. [sn9,-] she said.	After we came [wd3,- s] to the hospital, she let me sit on a bench and went though [fm1,-] the formalities for me. When I was seeing the doctor, she stand [vp6,-s] by me, her face filled with the expression of kindness, which made me comfortable. After the injection, she send [vp6, s-] me back to the dormitory. On the way home she told me about her experience when she used [wd3,-s] to be a freshman. I remember she said 'Everyone has the time in trouble.[sn8,s]If you challenge yourself to overcome the difficulties, you will become braver. ' I was deeply moved by her. 	I get [wd7, -1] over after a few days. The instructor's kind face and nice smile are always on my mind. They give me so much courageous [wd2,-s] .   	My grandfather passed away five years ago and he was a pious Christian. In my childhood, I always heard him tell [vp5,2-] my uncle, aunty and my mother something about Christ and Christianity, but I was too young to understand. But since I had the vague image in my mind that [wd5,-]who was Jesus and what he looked like ---just [wd5,-s] something very superficial. 	During the period of war between Iraq and Iran, all the people condemned it for it went against the will of the people. My grandfather was the same, [sn9, s-] he  [fm3,-] was so worried about it and got sick, had to take to his bed for almost a month. [sn1,s] On [wd3,-1] night he looked especially upset and asked me to come closer his [wd4, 1- 1] bed, said that peace of the world is the most important to the people on the earth ,[sn9,-] we [fm3,-]should try our best to keep peace. [sn1,s] Besides, God is everything and it [pr1,4-] can help us to achieve our aims. We should pray to God for an end to the suffering in these two countries. I was so moved that full of tears in my eyes [sn2,s-]. Though he sick [wd2,-] , he still remembered the [wd5,-1] peace in the world.   	Time is like a long river, in which all people have their own experiences, some happy, some sad . . . here [fm3,-]  is a moving experience. 	It was a very hot afternoon. As usual, the P. E. teacher asked us to run two rounds in the playground. When I was about to finish the distance, I felt terribly faint. and [fm3,-] then I lost consciousness. 	 when [vp1,-4]  [fm3,-] I had my consciousness back, I heard many voices. And when I opened my eyes, I saw many faces around me, my classmates, my teacher . . . They spoke to me when they saw me awake. Some asked, "Are you all right?" And some said, "You look terrible just now. But better now. " At that time, my teacher gave me a glass of water and said, 'Drink it and you will fell [fm1,-] better. " The water is [vp6,-s] quite warm. And my heart become [vp6,-s] warm, too. Although it happened several years ago, I still remember that day, the classmates, the teacher and that glass of water.   	It happened on [pp1,-2] my winter vacation. One day my Mum [fm3,-] looked a little upset when she came back from work. She looked at the mirror now and then and turned more and more dejected. Dad noticed that, but he didn't ask her why directly, [sn9,-]  he [fm3,-] just waited patiently. 	After supper, Mum said to Dad and I unhappily, "Maybe I shouldn't have had my hair do[wd5, 1- 1] changed. When I came into the office, some young men laughed at my new hair style [fm1,-] and said that it made me looked older. '	So that's the reason. My lovely Mum! Dad gazed at Mum for a while and told her firmly, 'It suits you well,  now you looked more beautiful and younger than before. '[sn6,s-] (but I didn't agreed [vp6, 1-] with Dad) 'Really?' Mum asked, became [vp5,-s] happy. 'Of course. Remember? I'm your husband, you should trust me? ' [sn9,-] And you should rust me, too, Mum. I'm your daughter, I think it suits you. ' I aid. 	Mum looked at me for a moment and then turned to Dad,  I knew she had accepted [wd3,-s] what we said[sn6,s-]. At that time, her face looked so gentle and beautiful that I agreed that Dad was right. I watched them, [wd4,1-1] couldn't help smiling. My parents loved me, and I'm so glad that they're in love.   	A friend in need is a friend indeed, and I know this meaning from a moving experience. 	"Black July" seems unlucky to those who failed to pass the entrance examination of college, but to me, it was more unlucky [sn6,s-]. Just a week before the exame [fm1,-], I had a car accident and broken [vp9,-s] my leg and had to stay at home. Under the press [wd2,-s] of the exame [fm1,-] , I was worried that I losed [vp6,-s] my [wd5,-s] control. When my mummy asked me to take medicines, I throw them away and cried out: "Mummy, I want to give up. I'm too tired to join [wd3,-2]  the exame [fm1,-], please forgive me [sn6,s-]. " "No, Helen, [sn9,-] Don't give up. you're always good at study. We all believe that you'll succeed" said my deskmate [fm1,-], who just came to visit me ,[sn9,-] " and brought a bid [fm1,-] card to me. On it, there are [vp6,-s] full of my classmates' signatures and kind words to encourage me and their best wishes. Seeing these works [wd3,-s] ,I moved [vp7,-1] to tears. But for these friends, I wouldn't enter [vp8,1-] university today. 	I'm blessed with boundless benefit from friendship, and from then on, I've valued my friends highly.   	I still remember it quite clearly. On [pp1,-3] a very hot evening, I received my uncle's call.It [pr1,-s] is [wd5,-s] voice sounded very upset. 'Where's your father?' 'Father has been to Guangshou [fm1,-] on business for several day [np3,1-].' I answered, 'now  [fm3,-] listen' his voice became very serious. [sn9,-] 'Grandpa is in danger. Inform father as soon as possible and ask your mother come back first. ' 'Remember, be quick. There is no more time. ' I was almost crying after hearing this. What happened to my dear grandpa?	After a while, mother came back. When she heard the bad new her face turned pale. She called a text first and then called the manager, my father's boss, asked [vp5,-s] him to do his best to contact with my father. Then we hurried back to our hometown. It took us about two hours to get there. 	When we entered the alley where my grandpa lived. There were a lot of people around there. Standing at the door. [sn9,-] I saw grandpa lying in the bed which was just a plank on two long chairs. Why did they move grandpa from the bedroom to the living room. Seeing grandpa lying there quietly, [wd4,-s]eye closed tightly .[sn9,-] I became frightened. I found my leg [np3,1-]  trembling. Uncle spoke to grandpa, 'Dad, your daughter-in-law have come [vp3,1-] back to see you. ' 'Dad, I'm here. ' mother said and there was tears in her eyes. "Mm. ' grandpa just couldn't speak. He stretched out his hand, a work-gnarled hand, just like the [np7,-1] brank  [wd7,4-] . "Where's my dear  grand child [fm1,-] ?' he murmured. 'Here, here. 'mother said. When I stood beside grandpa, when I saw his grey eyes, I was too frightened and I began to cry. 'Don't be afraid, my child.  he [fm3,-] is your grandpa'. 'Grandpa' I sobbed. 'My grandchild, my dear grand child [fm1,-] .   	Today was my 20th birthday. I went to school as usual and did the routine work. Nothing gonna be special. 	When I came back to my dormitory .[sn9,-] My [fm3,-] eyes brightened --- bound [wd3,- 2] of beautiful red roses lying on my desk. What a surprise! Who sent me so [wd3,-2] wonderful flowers? I found a card in it and read it immediately. 	"Happy Birthday! my dear. I hope these flowers would ing [fm1,-]you smile. Though I'm not by your side, my heart is always with you. Yours ever Pillow. ''	Its from my boy friend [fm1,-] Pillow. He wrote a letter with money to his close friend asking him to send me roses. I counted it. It was right [wd3,-1] 20. one [fm3,-] branch means one year. How considerate of him! I was so appreciated. It's my first time received  [vp5,1-] flower on my birthday. And I remembered that he had ever said that he would sent [fm1,-] me flowers on this special day. I thought it was just a joke and forget  [vp6,4-] it soon because it's impossible for him to do it from Xia Men --- a city which he is studying 900 km away from Guangzhou. however [fm3,-] , he did it. He kept his promise. I was so touched. 	It's quite different that you get concern when you are leaving [wd3,-1] home,[sn8,s] [sn9,-]Whoever he is, whatever you got [vp6,2-], you would appreciate it deeply. Of course, I would keep this moving experience in my mind forever. 	Girls are easy to be moved, especially when someone is willing to do anything for her [pr1,14-]. There's a moving experience that I'll never forget. 	Some years ago, a boy and I were good friends and he was kind to me. When I was in trouble, he would help me. When I was sad, he would confort [fm1,-] me. one [fm3,-] day after school, it was raining hard. it, was happened [wd5,-s] that my raincoat was broken [wd3,-s]. I would do nothing but wore it and went home. When he saw that, he ran [wd3,-3] to me by bike and wanted to exchange his raincoat with mine. at [fm3,-] first, I didn't agree. however [fm3,-] , he insisted on it and put off [vp1,-1] his raincoat. Then I had to put off [vp1,-1] put off[wd6,-]mine and gave it to him in case that he would catch cold. At last, he said goodbye to me and went back with my broken [wd3,-1]raincoat. I was touched, but what made me touched most was that he stuck [wd3,-2] my broken raincoat and gave back to me the next day. I was almost moved to tears. What a good friend her [fm1,-] was!	Although our friendship has come t o past tense [wd7,5-] , [sn9,-] for some reasons, I still remember what he had done for me and the happy days we had together.   	It's [fm1,-] an unforgetable [fm1,-] moving experience in my life. 	For some reason, I had been depressed for several days. My boyfriend knew it and tried to make me happy again. Though he was very busy then, he came to see me at midnight and sent me a bundle [wd3,-2] of roses --- which is my favourite. He told a lie that he thought it was my birthday and wanted to celebrate it for me. I was puzzled then but still accepted the flowers. That night he accompanied me, listening to my favourite music, telling jokes, and counting stars in the sky. [sn9,-]  etc. Though I knew that it wasn't my real birthday and he told a lie, I enjoyed the quality time with him. Smelling the flowers, I began to be happy and tolerant again. It was just because [wd4,-4]him and his concern. I think I'm lucky to have him accompany me. --- When I knew that he had to work harder the next day even without sleeping but he still accompanied me just to comfort me, I was so moved that I couldn't help my tears,[sn8,s]of course  [sn6,-s] , tears of gratefulness.   	This took place about five years ago. 	During the summer vocation of 1992, I got the notice that asked [wd3,-2] me to go on with my study at Sun Yat-sen Medical Academy. I was very happy that I'd have a new start. And my dream of being [wd3,-2] a nurse would soon come [wd3,-s]  into reality. with [fm3,-] the congratulations from my friends and relatives, I went to that school to challenge myself. As it was the first time that I lived independently, everything was new. Within two days, I got used to the new environment. I like [vp6,7-] that and I hope [vp6,3-] that would continue. 	Unfortunately, just on the fourth [np2,2-] day morning, my teacher asked my to come to his office and showed my health certification. And he told me that I had to quit my study there because of my poor health. I was astonished because everything was out of my expectation. At that time I couldn't get in touch with my family and I was in [pp2,-2] a lost [wd2,-s]. That night I cried my self [fm1,-] to sleep but I knew it was no use crying. Then the next day, I pack [vp6,4-] up my luggage and went home. 	Arriving home, I couldn't restrain from crying again. I worried about my future. I wanted to keep on with my study and I wondered whether our [pr1,-s] local middle school would accept me. That night I cried to sleep again even[wd7,-] my family conforted [fm1,-] me. The early next morning, accompanied by my brother, I went to that school and asked for the headmaster's permission. Luckily, the president asked me to go [wd3,-s] to school as soon as possible because the new semester began [vp8,-s] 2 weeks ago. Just at that time, I gave out a sob of grief. 	I think I was lucky and after 3 years, I came [wd4,1-]  this uiversity [fm1,-]. I'll keep his in my mind for ever because it is a moving experience.   	Moon Festival is a time for family reunion, I always celebrated it with my family [sn6,s-]. But the year before last, spent it [wd4,-1] myself. It was the first day I regested [fm1,-] to the university. That morning, parents who campanied [fm1,-]  me from home to school, must went home because my youngersister was waiting for them [sn6,s-]. I am very sad that I would be alone from then on. But I didn't express my feeling on my faces [np3,1-]. It would made [vp9,1-] mother sadder and more concerned about me. When they got on the train, they told me that [wd4,-1]  had bought some moon cakes [fm1,-] for me and  played [wd3,- 1] it [np3,5-] on desk. I contended [wd3,-1] my tears and nodded and said good-by. I saw the tears were in their eyes. That night, I unwraped [fm1,-] the cake box and found a note 'Though we are far away from you now, don't be late.  	When you miss Dad and Mum, you can write or call us . We hope you are happy at school. You are our dear girl,  we will miss you. Dad and Mum. It's from Mum [sn6,s-]. 	Oh, I know, my parents are very concerned about me. I saw that from their eyes. They tried to reassure me and company [wd3,-1] me. I stared at the moon and saw the love from my parents. I was alone on [wd3,-1] the Moon Festival, but My [fm3,-] heart were [vp3,1-] with my parents and my sister.
