As they do more exercises and often think deeply. [sn2,s] If they take less fat and sugar, they would have less power. And it will affect their future. I advise people [wd4,s]eat enough fat and sugar. Don't worry about put on weight or bad teeth.[sn8,s] Bad teeth are not by the food .[sn8,s] Now you must know hamburger is not so bad. It's rich in fat and sugar. It has less vegetable and fiber than normal meal. But it's fast food. Most of people need fast food who are busy in their works. So do not believe doctor's words at all.

[sn8,s]Her friend told her that necklace wasn't a real diamond necklace. It was worth five hundred france [fm1,-] but was not thirty six thousand frances [fm1,-].I think women can get jobs easily today. They can do all kinds of jobs.

Dear Wang Ning, Thank you for writing to me. You said you had wanted to know about the differences between American English and British English. The English language we know today is about six hundred years old. For half that time, English was just the language of the English living in England. The modern English language grew by about the year 1400. Many words were borrowed from French and Germany. As people from Europe travelled [fm1,-]outside Europe, European languages began to [vp7, -1] used in other parts of the world. At first, the languages staged the same as those in Europe, but slowly they began to grow apart. Today, the differences between American English and British English are not very great. Written English is more or less the same in both Britain and America, though there are some spelling differences. For example, centre, colour, travelled [fm1,-]and favourite are apelt [fm1,-] center, color, traveled and favorite in American English. But people from the two countries can understand each other easily. Though the English passed their language on to North America, these days, the British have borrowed a lot of new words from the Americans, such as teenager, boyfriend, radio, football, fan, right away(at once), way of life, and so on. There are only a very small number of differences in grammar between American English and British English. The most important differences are in spoken English. For example, Americans pronounce tomato as [t?`meit?u], new as [nu:], address as [adres]. You may wonder "which is correct?" The answer is that it does not matter. But you should speak either American English or British English. Do not try to speak both at the same time! Best wishes!           Yours, Mr Lan

LEARNING A LANGUAGE
in [fm3,-s] schools all over the world boys and girls are learning language [np6,-]. many [fm3,-s] grown-ups are doing so in their spare time. Everybody knows [wd4,2-2] own language, but to know another is very useful. Which is the best may [fm1,-] to learn a language? We should remember that we all learnt our own language well when we were children. If we could learn a second language in the sane way, it would not seem so difficult. Think of what a child does. It listens to what people say and it tries to limitate [fm1,-] what it heard [vp6,s-]. When it wants something, it has to ask for it. it [fm3,-s] is using the language. It is talking in it and thinking in it all the time. if [fm3,-s] people had to use a second language all the time, they would learn it quickly. It is important to remember, also, that we learn our own language by hearing people speak it, not by seeing what they write. We imitate what we hear. In school, though you learn to read and write as well as to hear and speak, it is best to learn all new words through the ear of cause [wd3,s-], [sn9,-] you must learn to read them, spell them, and write them, too. There is no easy way to success in language learning. a [fm3,-s] good memory is a great help, but it is not enough only to memerize [fm1,-] rules from a grammar book. it [fm3,-s] is not such used learning [wd7,s-] by heart long lists of words and their meanings, studying the dictionary and so on. we [fm3,-s] must learn by using the language. of [fm3,-s] [wd7,-s] we are satisfied with a few rules we have memorized, we are to [wd5,-s] really learning the language." learn [fm3,-s] through practice" is a piece of good advice for those who are learning a new language. Practice is important [sn9,-] we must practice speaking and writing the language as much as we can. we [fm3,-s] learn to swim by getting into the water and swimming. And we learn to speak English by speaking it and not by being told about it.

LEARNING A LINGUAGE [fm1,-] 
in [fm3,-s] school all over the world boys and girls are learning foreign languages. Many grown-ups are doing so in their spare time. Everybody knows his own language, but to know another is very useful. Which is the best way to learn a language? We should remember that we all learnt our own language well when we were children. If we could learn a second language in the same way, it would not seem so difficult. Think of what a child does. It listens to what people say and it tries to imitate what it heard [vp6,s]. When it wants something, it has to ask for it. it [fm3,-s] is using the language. It is talking in it and thinking in it all the time. if [fm3,-s] people had to use a second language all the time, they would learn it quickly. It is important to remember, also, that we learn our own language by hearing people speak it , not by seeing what they write. We imitate what we hear. In school , though you learn to read and write as well as to hear and speak , it is best to learn all new words through the ear. Of course, you must learn to read them, spell them , and write them, too. There is no easy way to success in language learning. A good memory is a great help. But it is not enough only to memerize [fm1,-] rules from a grammar book. It is not such used [sn8,s] learning by heart long lists of words and their meanings, studying the dictionary and so on. We must learn by using the language. If we are satisfied with a few rules we have memorized, we are not really learning the language." Learn through practice" is a piece of good advice for those who are learning a new language. practice [fm3,-s] is important. we [fm3,-s] must practice speaking and writing the language as much as we can. We learn to swim by getting into the water and swimming. and [fm3,-s] we learn to speak English by speaking it and not by being told about it.

We know that we all learnt our own language well when we were children. We learn a second language in the same way. It won't seem so difficult. How does a small child [sn8,s]? It listens to what people say and it tries to guess what it hears. when [fm3,-s] it wants some thing [fm2,1-]. [sn9,-] it has to ask for it. it [fm3,-s] is using the language, thinking in it and talking in it all the time: if people use a second language all the time, they will learn in quickly. In school, you learn to read [sn9,-] to write [sn9,-] to hear and to speak. it [fm3,-s] is best to learn all new words through the ear. you [fm3,-s] can read them [sn9,-] spell them and write them later.

And most of [wd4,3-3] bookmark [np6,3-] are beautiful. There are some beautiful picture [np6,2-] and wonderful words on it [pr3,d].    So I like bookmark [np6,3-] very much. 
                        Breakfast
    Breakfast is very important for us. We will show power in the day if we have breakfast in the morning. But some people don't have breakfast. They said [vp6,-s] they hurry to go to work and have no time to have breakfast. But it does harm to our health that we don't have breakfast.    So everyone must have breakfast in the morning! 
                      The sports I like
    I like playing shuttlecock very much though I play not well [vp1,s].  When we play it, we must jump high to play it back. It is said that can helps [vp9,1-1] to grow tall to jump high.  And it also make [vp3,2-] us nimbe [fm1,-]. Because the shuttlecock always comes very fast. [sn2,s]So we must judge the direction and finish the action quickly.    I hope I could play it well one day. 
              The Profressor [fm1,-] And His Invention
   Profressor [fm1,-] Hunter was very excited the [wd3,s-1] morning, because he had completed the papers off [fm1,-] his new invention which everyone would benefit from it [wd5,s-]. He decided to give it [pr3,d] to the goverment [fm1,-]. It was arranged that two government officials would come for the papers at eleven o'clock in the morning.   But at half past ten, two men arrived. They said they were just the right men coming for [wd3,s-1] London. As they looked too nervous and were too fast to leave [cc6,-], the professor didn't believe them. He only gave them some papers put behind some books on the shelf, and they left in a hurry.  Shortly after that, the police telephone [vp6,s-] and told [vp1,-s] that the two government officials's [fm1,-] card [np3,3-] had been stopped and their cards had been stolen. Hearing this, the professor's secretary began to cry. At this moment, two police officers called. They said that the two men were imposters and they must try hard to catch them.    To their great surprise, the professor said it was not necessary. Because he had known that before, he gave them papars [fm1,-] that isn't [vp3,s-] about the invention. 
                     My Winter Holiday
  This winter holiday is a busy holiday. Almost of [wd5,1-2] every subjust [fm1,-] has homewords [fm1,-] and exercises. All of them are like a hill on my desk. However [sn9,-] I can have some time to spend in doing something that I like. For example reading some novel [np3,1-] and listening to the radio. Today is the forth [fm1,-] day of this holiday. I must treasure the leaving day [cc4,-]off this short holiday to do everything that I want and make these days happy.   [sn8,s] 
                    The Spring Festival
  The Spring Festival is coming. When you walks [vp3,1-] on the streets, you'll find everyone who is walking have [vp3,s-] many bags with them [pr3,s-], small or big, with smiles on their faces [np3,s-]. Their [fm1,-] are uninterruptedly [cc4,1-] people in the shop which sells food, wine and so on. And in the fashion shop, the customer [np3,1-2] are talking over the price with the shopkeeper.

                   Hung-clock Flower
  When you are walking in the yearly flower maket [fm1,-], you will see a lovely kind of flower -- hung-clock flower.  Its trunk is very slim and there're sparse leaves on it. Every flower bud has several flower [np3,1-]. It's said if every bud has eight flower [np3,1-], it will brings [vp9,2-] lucky [wd2,2-].  The flowers open[cc6,-]downward. They're all small like a drops [np3,1-] of water. When the soft wind comes, it will sway, like many little clocks. and [fm3,-s] telling us the spring has come [sn8,s]. 
                No Word In Deeply [wd2,1-1] Love 
  It is a very move [wd2,2-1] story.  When he was a soldier in Fujian, he made [vp2,-4] friend with another soldier who came from [wd4,1-3] Eastnorth [fm2,-] of China. There was deeply [wd2,2-1] friendship. [sn9,-] between them. Once after they finished a task under the sea, [wd4,s] other soldiers came back, the bank.[sn2,s] But his good friend was fast asleep at the bottom of the sea for ever [fm2,1-].  At that time he kept staring to [wd3,1-2] the sea for a long time.  After the soldier demobilized, he went to the friend's home.[sn8,s] Before he came in, he cried: "Mum, I has come [vp9,2-1] back." He knelt on his knees, choking with sobs.   He would give some money from his pay to the mother who lost the son after that. And he would go to faraway [wd2,4-2] to see another mother.  His love gave her the courage of living, and his love move [vp3,3-2] himself too.    In the hard to say pain,[sn8,s] there is the hard to say [fm2,4-] happiness. [sn8,s]The beautiful life is about so.

  When I write [vp6,-s] weekly dairly [fm1,-] in [wd3,1-3] the first time, I was very happy. Because it is [vp6,-s] a strange thing in my mind, so [wd5,s-] I was very pleasure [wd2,4-2] in doing that. But when time passed, I felt [vp1,1-4] it getting more and more troublesome to write an [np7,2-1] composition. It would take me some time to think out a topic and look. [sn9,-] up plenty of words that I hadn't known before in the dictionary.   However, it's our task to improve the can [wd2,s-] of writting [fm1,-] composition. And I must to learn [vp9,2-2] how to use the words and expression freely.                                                                      March 18

Dear Wangming: [sn9,2-]
  It is for some time that I haven't write [vp9,2-] to you. I'm busy recently. Because of it, I must say sorry to you.  Now let me tell you about the situation of my study. I think I learn Chinese, Maths [fm3,2-3] and History [fm3,4-2] better than other subject [np6,s-]. On the contrary, I am worried about Physics [fm3,s-] and English class. Especialy [fm1,-] the reading comprehesion [fm1,-] and the written [wd2,s-] in English. How can I get them well? Do you have any idea that can improve them? Could you tell me the way?

  I have been in senior high school for about a month. But I haven't quite got used to the school life here. Because I have some difficulty in some subject [np3,1-] such as English.  One day, my teacher asked me and had a talk with me. She gave me some advice on how to learn the foreign language--English. For example preparation, taking notes and reviewtion [fm2,-]. And he also tell [vp6,d] me to read aloud every day and do a lot of reading. I was greatly encouraged about that and followed my teacher's advice.  Now, I have made some progress. I am very greatful [fm1,-] to my teacher.  Our monitor Li Gang is a tall boy which [pr5,s-] has bright eyes. He is strict with himself. He studies hard and do [vp3,4-2] well in physics. He also like [vp3,2-] sports. As a member of the school football team, he often goes playing football after school.  Li Gang is always ready to help others. I used to be poor in physics. Without his help, I couldn't make such progress in my study.  All of us likes [vp3,2-] him very much. 
  June 14th                                     Fine
  It was nearly 30 [wd4,4-3] centigrade this afternoon for I saw about seven or eight children swimming in the river. And most of them did well in it. There was a little girl who was taught to swim by her mother.  I used to swim in my childhood. The last time I swam was about ten years ago during [pp1,-s] I spent my holiday in Beijing.    I think June is one of the best months in a year.

3.10.  Sunday   cloudy [fm3,2-] 
  It'll soon be New Year, [sn9,-] a [fm3,-]lot of shops reduced the price to sell the goods. It was marked [cc5,-1]down by 50%, 30% ... This [np3,-1] ideas were very useful, for example [sn9,-] a shop of bossini [fm1,-] was marked [cc5,-1]down by 50%  so that the people must in batched [fm1,-] enter.[sn8,s] I belived [fm1,-] this landscape is the only one of its kind on [wd3,1-2] the modern years. As a matter of fact this a urge results [wd7,3-], many shops were kick upstairs or early raise late mark [cc5,-1]down, in fact didn't reduce the price [sn8,s]. Before soon, [sn8,s]the Yicheng night paper also wrote about it and criticized this amiss [wd7,-] and unsuitable things [np3,4-].   [wd4,-2] Saturday afternoon, mother brought me a nroden [fm1,-] radio. [fm3,-]for my birthday [sn9,-]I'm very happy and say "Thank you, my mother." [sn1,s] This radio isn't a [np7,1-2] ordinary radio. It is the first that I saw [vp6,s-]. It's Functions [fm3,1-2] was [vp3,2-] most. [sn8,s]a [fm3,-s] lot of functions that I ever knew example [wd7,s-]. It had [vp6,1-s] a function call [vp4,4-2] "read again" though I researched a long time at last, I know it mean .[sn8,s] It mean [vp3,1-] when you listen once if you didn't listen clear [wd2,3-2] and want to listen again [sn8,s]. you [fm3,-s] wouldn't put in the "Rew". you [fm3,-s] only put on "read again", [wd4,-s] radio can read again and again if you listen clear [wd2,2-]. only [fm3,-s] put on the "play" [sn2,s]. radio [fm3,-s] can read the next word.  This function was very useful. I love you, my mother.  Today is my father's birthday. It is most colder [aj3,3-2] than yesterday, but we are very happy.    The dinner was very weathly [fm1,-]. When the dinner [wd4,2-1] finished, it was night [wd3,2-1] o'clock. After a while, [wd4,-s] uncle took out a birthday cake and said: "Let's sing a birthday song to father, Ok [fm3,s-]?"   "Happy birthday to you, [sn9,-] Happy birthday to you."    My father smiled and we put the cake on his face, the fair[wd7,s-] also had it this time, gather turned off a [np7,-2] old man, [sn8,s]so we couldn't smiling [vp9,1-1] and called him grandfather.   "Haha, haha..." The smile came from my home now and thin [fm1,-]. My fiamly [fm1,-] dropped [cc5,-5]into the middle of smile [np7,-].  Now it is night [wd3,2-1] O'clock [fm3,3-], [sn9,-] I just get up. What a good sleep last night!    After a while, when I'm having the baskfast [fm1,-], the doorbell rang [vp6,s-]. "What's that?" I ask. but [fm3,-s] no one answers. Then I go and open the door, however, I couldn't see anything, [sn9,-] So I close the door and to [wd7,-] on with my baskfast [fm1,-]. While I sit down, the bell rant [fm1,-] again. Often the door [wd7,2-], but could see nothing again [sn8,s-.  I get angry, "Who make fun of me!" I say to myself.  Why have so many foolish men on the world [sn8,s]? If they can use this time to make our homeland [cc3,2-] and do some useful things for people, then, our homeland will become stronger and polite [cc4,s-]. but [fm3,-s] the better impotant [fm1,-]  is their lives also became [vp6,s-] instrutive [fm1,-].[sn8,s]  Teachers usually say: " It is important to listen [vp1,-3] and read English." If you do so, you will make progress in listening and improve English study.  For this, I often listen to some English songs when I was [vp6,s-] free. An English song I listened [vp1,1-1] [vp6,s] it again and again, but I didn't [vp6,s-] understand the meaning, only can hear [cc3,-2]some words. But when I read the songs paper [cc1,2-], almost all of [wd4,3-1] words I both [wd5,-]understand, and the meaning I also understand.   But I will not give up listening [vp1,-2] English songs, because they are very good, and I belive [fm1,-] I can understand it [pr3,s-] one day. 
  One day Robinson Crusoe saw the mark of a man's foot in the sand. He was terrified at his sight, [sn9,-] He stayed in his cave after he found nothing. After a [wd3,2-1] time he began to go out again, but he felt even more lonely without his friend, the dog.  He often thought about the footmark. He decided to go back and look again. He found out it was much larger than his own.  He decided to looked [vp5,3-1] for a better hiding-place because he thought there must [vp8,s-] be someone else on the island. He saw two eyes glaring at him in the new cave. At last, he found out that [wd4,s-] two eyes was [vp3,2-2] the goat's.  It was autumn, [sn9,-] on the shore, [sn9,-] were nine savages, sitting round a fire. Crusoe returned home for two guns. He went towards the fire, [sn9,-] he found a human being [np4,4-1] bones.   Crusoe knew that the savages killed their enemies and ate them, [sn9,-] He made up his mind to shoot them if they came again. But many months went by and no one visited the island. 
  If someone asked [vp6,-s] me: "What color do you like?" I'll said [vp9,1-]: "I like blue."  Blue is a kind of wonderful color. When I catch sight of blue, I'll think of sky, the wide sky. In the blue sky, cloud [np7,-s floats here and there.   When I catch [vp2,-3] sight off blue, I'll also think of sea, bonndles [fm1,-] sea. In the blue sea, full of mystery [sn2,s].I like blue. 
  A long time ago, the town of Altorf in Swilzerland [fm1,-] was ruled by Austria. Gesslen was the governor of Altof.   One day, Willian [fm1,-]Tell, a famous hunter, came to Altorf with his litter[fm1,-] son. In the marketplace, there was a pole where a hat in the top of Willian [fm1,-]Tell [wd7,s-] saw the pole, but he would have none of it. Even before the crud [fm1,-] governor himself Willian [fm1,-]and his son did not bow.  He picking [vp4,1-5] an apple from a tree. He ordered the soldier to take the boy one hundred paces down the street and to place the apple with one of his arrows [wd7,s-].  Without saying a word, Willian [fm1,-]drew two arrows. He called to his son: " Look this way." The boy turned around and face [vp6,s-] his father. Slowly Willian [fm1,-] Tell raised the bow, and after taking careful aim, let the arrow fly.  The story  of the bravery of Willian [fm1,-] Tell and his son quickly got round throughout Switzerland.  Today, the Olympic Games was open. This is the twenty-six [wd3,d] session, and also [wd5,-]the Olympic Games was born [cc2,4-] one hundred years [wd4,-]. so [fm3,-s] this session was [vp6,s-] very important and [wd4,s-] far-reaching historical significance.  Though I can't see all of the opening ceremony, but [wd5,s-] I can feel the front how great and grand sight. [sn8,s]From the player's face, we can see the players are are [wd6,3-3] in high spirits and very nervous in [wd3,-3] the same time. I think that must have a sharp [cc4,-]match. Then we can't miss it! 
  Today is my mather's [fm1,-] birthday. It is much hotter than yesterday, but we are very happy.  The dinner was very weathly [fm1,-] and very expensive. When the dinner finished, we went home.

[sn9,-] I'll say: "I like blue very much."     Blue is a kind of wonderful color. When I catch sight of blue, I'll think of sky, the wide sky [cc4,2-]. In the blue sky, cloud [np7,-] floats here and there, give [vp4,s-] me some daydream and self is so little [wd7,s-].  When I catch sight of blue, I'll also think of sea, bonndles [fm1,-] sea. In the blue sea, full of mystery [sn2,s]. Let me remember some spirits story [cc1,1-] and I want to see the foot of sea.  I like blue.

  On the Spring Festival as pass [wd7,5-], haven't any especial things happened .[sn8,s] But the new years [np6,2-4] came two days before. Nearly [wd2,-4] my house appeared a cow. The cow walked in the flower street, and the policeman shot it. The cow is a very very [wd6,-]kind animal, so the policeman shouldn't shot [vp9,1-1] it at all. This is too cruel!  Teachers usually say:" It is important to listen [vp1,1-3] and read aloud English. If you do so, you will make progress in listening and improve [wd4,s-1] study.  For this, I often listen to some English songs when I was [vp6,s-] free. At first, I can't listen [vp1,-5] a word of the song, but I can listen [vp1,-3] some words now.

This Monday we had had a phisical [fm1,-] test. But many students failed. And I'm one of these students.  [sn2,s] For, being no good, I'm very sad. So in the four  [np6,1-1] day's holiday, I'll try my best to grasp the knowledge and keep up with other classmates. This Thursday my good friend gave me a present. It's for my birthday. The present is a pair of black and white cups. I like them very much. In fact, my birthday had  [vp4,3-3] past for several months. For some reasons, my good friend  [ad1,3-3] only can give me the present these days. Though it's a late present, I've never mind. Because our friendship isn't  [vp4,1-2] build by present, but it's very ture[fm1,-] and pure. The People's Republic of China had been founded for forty-six years. Tomorrow --  Oxtober [fm1,-] 1 is our National day. Everybody in China  [vp3,3-1] know this. It's necessary for everyone to love his own homeland. We must do so. October 6 Friday Rainy It was raining hard when I went to school this morniong [fm1,-]. I was wearing  [np6,3-1] the  clothing[wd3,2-3] with short  [np6,3-3] sleeve at that time. I  [vp1,1-3] felt it very cold. When I got to the classroom, I found that many of my classmates were wearing  [np6,1-1] the  clothing[wd3,2-3] with long  [np6,5-0] sleeve. thought:" Why didn't I wear  [np6,1-1] the clothing [wd3,2-3] with long [np6,2-0] sleeve? How silly I am!" It gets colder and colder. After a while, the classmate who sat by my side  [vp6,6-4] take off her outer clothing and said: "Would you like to put on my clothing? I don't feel cold now." "Thank you!" I said. And I put on the clothing. It was very warm. I looked at her with a smile --What a nice girl! Sunday Oct. 15 Rainy Today we were organized to see a film in Bud Theater in the Children's Palace. In the morning, my friend and I walked along the street to the theater.

[sn8,0-23] The girl in our group who  [vp7,6-2] named Li Xiaojun depended on her own actual strength so that our grade  [vp4,2-4] be in a higher place. But a boy who [wd4,3-2]  in  [fm3,-] group  [fm3, -] three was very good at history. He was a formidable opponent to us. The third part was the tensest in the whole match. A group must choose a question to[wd3,-] each group among  [np6,0-5] the  [fm3,-] grade 10, 20 or 30. If they gave the right answer, they would score. And they would lose the grade.

I don't like rain [sn9,-]  From antiquity to today, many people loved rain.  [cj1,0-4] While I don't like it. [sn2,s] When I studied at junior middle  [np6,3-0] school, I became [wd2,2-3] loathing rain very much. The rainwater would flood to the Tai Bao straight street when it rained hard. So the students had to show their beautiful legs --rolled up their bottom of the trousers legs[wd5,1-0], took off their shoes and socks,  [vp1,0-2] waded the "river". If they wouldn't be careful, they would  [wd7,1-2] plus a "printing" on their sole. It was sunny when I went out one day. Of course, I wouldn't take an umbrella. To my surprise, it rained. So my classmate and I held up one umbrella to go home. On our way home, a car passed by. The  watter [fm1,-] on the road was spattered on my treasured trousers. Oh, How poor my trousers were! I don't like rain. It always  [vp3,2-2] make me unhappy. I like sunlight and resplendent smile. I hope rain won't come often.

 Please cherish your eyes[sn9,-] Eyes are the windows of soul for people. They can make us see the [wd1,1-3] all fine things in the world. They are the most expensive for us.  You'll have a lot of trouble if you are not able to see . Because if you are blind, you must depend on your ears or hands. And  [pr1,1-5] it'll live in a black world. If you are [wd2,3-0] nearsightedness, then you'll be  [wd1,3-3] not able to see the distinct things without glasses. So we must cherish our eyes. Ordinarily, we must not read in a dark place, and don't read in the sun, and don't read when we are walking, and don't read in bed. Besides, we must do the setting-up exercises of eyes earnestly. And  [vp1,1-3] look[vp1,-2] more the[wd5.1-1] plants. A pair of normal eyes is very important for us. I hope everyone will have a pair of normal eyes.

I love all the fine things in the world. I like singing, writing, taking a photo, drawing...  [fm3,-] Because I think  [vp5,2-1] take photos and  [vp5,3-2] draw pictures can retain the beautiful scenery. And  [vp5,1-3] sing songs,  [wd4,2-2]  [vp5,2-1] write can make things even better.

And the result was not bad.  [sn8,0-7] But I  [vp6,2-8] take photos for the first time,[sn9,-] I often worried about if I can do well in it. When the photos have been developed, I found that my friend 's photos were better than mine. For I'm a common person, I was unhappy in the heart of course. However, I had straightened out my thinking after all. It's good that I dare to join the match. And I should be pleased that my friend's photos are good. In fact, I think everyone should be broadminded.If we [fm1,-] an do this, we'll be happy [wd4,3-1]  whatever time.

He said, Only [fm3,-]a person wear [np3,-]formal attire, and that's me. There's point in making wedding dress with rubbish sack.

Of all the cards,  [sn8,0-12]I like best is the card which my best friend  [vp6,3-4] send to me. It  [vp7,1-7] made in [wd3,1-] a piece of golden hard paper. And there's no pattern on it. A piece of white cellophane paper is  [vp7,7-2]  [vp1,7-2] covered with it. On the white cellophane paper,  [vp3,0-3] there's some special characters. The whole card looks very  [cc4,5-0] well.

Sea[fm3,-][np7,-] is beautiful and mysterious. I like it very much. Light blue sea is my favourite. When sunlight  [vp3,2-4] shine on the limpid sea, seawater [fm1,-]  [vp3,1-3] reflex much gold light. If you put two wood chairs with simple moulding [fm1,-]on the seaside, let seawateer [fm1,-]soak the legs of the chairs. You can fancy, the light yellow sand can be seen through the light blue gold seawater, and the two chairs.  What a  beautiful tablean[fm1,-]! And how romantic! Won't anyone love it? Dark blue sea is not so beautiful as light blue sea. But it has its own graceful bearing. It is a mature sea. It always  [vp3, 2-4] stretch out both warm arms, and  [vp3,8-4] make people feel comfortable. At night, the sea  [vp3,2-1] become mysterious. It is dark everywhere. You  [ad1,1-1] only can hear the sound  [sn8,3-6] that from the wave lash the rock.  Perhaps you can see the sea in the moonlight. But it's so dim. I think the sea in the evening is enjoyed with[wd3,-] ears. Sea, the place which I yearn for is like a pretty girl. And it will be a beauty for ever.

The Emperor's New Clothes 
The procession finished. The Emperor and the officials came back to the Palace. the Emperor thought back the scene that happened just now, and felt very silly and angry. Then he ordered the  officials who had seen the "perfect new clothes" to wear that "new clothes" and walked in the Palace. The officials had to be at his beck [fm1,-]and call[vp6,-]. Then they walked  [wd4,-] had nothing on. The  [fm3,-] Emperor looked at those men -- [fm3,-] They were so unsightly. He thought, " I surely lost face just now! People must think I'm a foolish man!" He thought and thought. Finally, he became mental because he thought too much. So another man became the  [fm3,-] Emperor. And he was a very good emperor. Then what about the old  [fm3,-] Emperor? He turned from side to side in front of the mirror every day, and hummed, " I'm so foolish. I'm so stupid..." March 10 Sunday Rainy I'm a voracious person.  [sn8,0-3] Why I aid so? Well, let me tell you. When I was still a little girl, I understand that English is a kind of interesting language.  Because it's not our own language. [sn2,s] It's strange for me. In those days, I was eager to learn English. Then I grew up. I was studuying [fm1,-]English and can sing English songs. I like English songs. And then I found Japanese songs were good, too. So I hoped to learn Japanese. Many people said, " French is the most beautiful language in the world." With this sentence, my mind is perturbed again for foreign languages. After this, I became wishing to learn all the foreign languages. But I regretted that I had no spare time to learn them. When you finish reading my article, do you think I am a voracious girl? March 17 Sunday Cloudy I have several idols. They are the singers in Hong Kong and Tai Wan -- Wang Faye, Leslie Zhang, Zheng Yijian, Jeff Zhang., Chen Jieyi...... And I like Wang Faye [wd7,4-0] vest. Wang Faye has a good voice. It sounds very clear and light . And it's special. I will be relaxed when I hear her songs. She has not only actual strength , but also an outstanding surface. Sometimes she combed her hair like the pineapple, wore the perspective dress. Sometimes she cut the hair very short, then adhered some long hair. And sometimes her attire is pure. However, they are all  [vp7,3-1] fit her. Someone had ever said Wang Faye had her own way unduly. Because she was of uncertain whereabouts, and refused the visitations. It's too unfair that thet [fm1,-] said so. Wang Faye is not good at  [vp5,2-2] link up stranger all along. And she  [vp3, 1-4] don't like to tell others about her private matter. Though the reporter asked her again and again. She began to  [vp1,3-0] detest. And then often "be missing".  [sn8,s] It made me only can hear her new songs a little time. Faye, I will always support you . You must sing more good songs for us!  March 24 Sunny[sn9,-] Cloudy[sn9,-] A girl's true story was pubished [fm1,-]on the magazine. The girl's name was Sun Yi. Sun Yi was an orphan. When she was still a baby, an old woman adopted her. Except Sun Yi's grandmother (the old woman), her foster parents didn't treat her well. They are the old woman's daughter and son-in-law. They didn't  [vp1,1-5] let SunYi to go to school without the old woman  [vp5,4-1] implored them. Sun Yi[cc4,2-3] very treasure [cc5,1-]the chance that she can study. She kept the first three place [np6,-]in the class all along [wd3,-].But her life is too suffering[aj1,-]. 
  She was forced to go to the Buddhist nunnery when she was just thirteen years old! Afterwards, she left there for continuing her studying. But it's still very bumpy. For studying, she went to Xin Jiang thousands of li away to attend school. She sold blood to take the money. Though she had paid too much, her  four[wd7,1-5] dreams that go to college were still shattered. From 1988 to 1995, Sun Yi began to pubish [fm1,-]literary works. And people recognized the worth of her. At the same time, Sun Yi's grandmother died. Sun Yi was very sad. She told her grandmother, "I'll never live up to the kindness of you. You must be proud of your choose[wd2,6-3] 22 years ago..." April 7 Sunday Cloudy Magic is a very marvellous[fm1,-]  technique. The famous magician David (How spell?)'s magic is special[wd2,-] wonderful. David bent over the "bed" which was made of metal on the stage. Several persons locked him on the "bed" with 5 locks. Then put some metallic board around him, and locked them like a box. Everything was ready, the electric saw which [wd4,-] over him about 10 metres began turnning [fm1,-]round very fast and dropping slowly. Sunddenly[fm1,-], David opened the "box" and began untying the locks. When he untied all the locks except one of them which [wd4,1-3]  on his waist, the whole audience cried out --the electric saw had cut David! The working personnels [fm1,-]pulled open the "bed", David's upper part of the body separated his lower part of the body. People [vp1,1-1] gaped David. David stirred his feet. Clapping was sounded. 
 David  [vp3,1-1] haven't died! Then David made the times flow backwards. finally, David had restored. Besides, David had a lot of astonishing unique  [np6,5-0] skill. He can go through the Great Wall with his human body, fly without anything to depend on like a superman, let a lady pierce through his own body, [vp6,8-0] made the [wd4,2-3]  or a plane or a train disappear in a very very [wd6,-] short time --about 30 seconds [sn9,-] David, an outstanding magician, I admire him very much. Do you agree?

 One day, when Robinson Crusoe was walking on the sands, he saw a mark of a man's foot in the sand. But there was nobody on the sands except him. He was very frightened at the footprint. He went home at once. And looking behind now and then.[sn9,-][fm3,-]He stayed in his cave for some days because he was afraid to meet the footmark's maker. Soon after, Crusoe's dog died. Crusoe  [vp6, 1-1]  [vp1,1-1] look it as his friend, he was very sad, and felt very lonely this time. He sometimes thought, "Did I make the footmark myself?"

Crusoe prepared seversal [fm1,-]guns and  [np5,0-2] lots of gun-powder in his cave. But he thought that it wasn't safe enough, so he went out and looked for a better hiding-place. Finally, he found a cave with narrow entrance. He went into it. Sundenly [fm1,-]he saw two eyes glared at him in the darkness. He hurried out into the daylight. Crusoe stepped into the cave with a burning stick, and found out that two eyes he had seen was a dead goat's eyes. He also found out there was a good hiding-place. One day, Crusoe climbed up to his lookout. He saw nine savages sitting round a fire on the shore. There were two canoes near them. It seemed that they were eating something. As soon as the savages had gone, Crusoe fetched two guns from his home. The two canoes were hardly able to see.[vp7,s]  Crusoe went to the fire, found the bones of human being among the ashes. [sn9,-]He [fm3,-]made up his mind to kill the savages when they came again. But no one  [vp1,3-7]came the island again for a long time.

 Youth is the bud on the branch in the gentle and soft spring. It is full of fancy and hope, and it lets the young affection drift in the green world. Youth is the wave that  [vp3,3-3] surge on the sands in the burning summer. It is so lively, so fresh and cool,  [sn2,s] that can rinse your distress. Youth is zeal that is permeated with the red leaves on the maple in the desolate autumn. We are going to sing for youth. Youth is the snow in the cold winter. It is pure, sparkling and crystal-clear, and it makes this world very very [wd6,-] pretty... 
 The Story Of William Tell 
William Tell came to Altorf with his little son. In that town, A pole was placed in the marketplace. [sn2,s] Because Switzerland was ruled by Austria. [sn2,s]The Austrian governor, Gessler,  [vp1,0-7] ruled with a firm hand to the Swiss. People were ordered to bow before the pole  [sn8,0-5] which was placed Gessler's hat on. William Tell knew about it, but he would not bow. So he was caught to Gessler. Willian Tell hadn't  [vp5,3-1] bow yet. Gessler was very angry. He thought out a cruel plan to punish Tell. He ordered Tell to shoot at the apple which was on his own son's head one hundred paces away. William's son was brave. William choosed [fm2,-]one arrow and let it fly. The apple was split in half. Since that, people respected William and his son very much,and rose up to [vp5,3-0] drove the Austrian soldiers out of their homeland. Finally, they [vp6,1-0] succeed. 
  My first teacher
 People always said, "The first lover is unforgettable." I think the first teacher is unforgettable, too. My first teacher was  [np7,1-4] an  [wd4,1-3] about 50-year-old Chinese teacher. We called her Mrs. Jean. Mrs Jean was tall, vigorous and serious. We feared her very much. At that time, we thought Mrs. Jean was partial. She liked the boy monitor [ad1,5-0] especially. When the boy monitor had made a mistake, she always didn't gave him a heavy punishment. We thought that's unfair. But nobody deared [fm1,-]to say that. Afterwards, Mrs Jean went to another school. On the contrary, we began missing her. Then we went to see her on one Sunday. We felt Mrs. Jean was affectionate in fact. But Mrs. Jean had been away. We had to bless her far away.  The senseless cheap trick The day before yesterday, I heard from a letter. At first, I was very surprised. Who would write to me? I opened it. Oh, it was the cheap trick which had continued for several years. It said he (she) is .[sn8,s] It was very lucky that I received the letter. He (she) asked me to make 20 carbon copies and send them to my friends in 9 days. And he (she)  [vp3,2-2] illustrate with examples if I sent them on time, I would be lucky; if I hadn't sent them on time or left them at home, I would have bad luck. In fact, my friends have ever  [wd3,4-5] heard from this kind of letters several years ago. Some of them copied and  sent the letters. But they hadn't got rich. Some of them  [vp6,3-3] throw the letter away. But they are all right all along. I don't know why the people thought of such a cheap trick. But I think these people are senseless. I wish they won't do that again. At he same time, I hope no one will be silly to copy these letters. Carve the boat to find sword Long long [wd6,-]ago, [sn2,s]A man went across the river. Suddenly, his sword slipped down from the sheath, then dropped into the river. The man carved a mark on the boat immediately and said, 'My sword dropped from here. " The boat reached the other side of the river. It stopped. The man took off his clothes, jumpped [fm1,-] into the river to find his sword according to the mark that he  [vp6,14-3] carve on the boat . He had found[wd3,2-4] for a long time, but found nothing of course. Sword will sink very fast if it  [vp3,1-2] drop into water. And the boat was moving. According to the mark on the moving boat to find the unmoving sword is imppossible[fm1,-]. So we mustn't stick to conventions. On the contrary, we must act accordinmg[fm1,-] to circumstances. Then we will be clever boys and girls. 
 In [pp1,-]this summer holiday, I was very happy.[sn2,s] Because I went to a place where I wished to go--Hong Kong.[sn7,-] Hong Kong is an island. It is very prosperous. And it is a good place for travelling[fm1,-]. It has not only a very big seascape, but so many tall buildings. In the day, you can see the buildings [vp5,3-3] stand on the ground or in the mountain clearly on the top of Tai Ping mountain. At night, they are very beautiful. All lights  [vp7,2-1] turn on.  Stand in Chim Sha Chui[vp5,4-], you'll see points and points of light, just like a lot of stars. How wonderful! The famous Ocean Park is quite amusing.  [vp3, 0-5] There are many stimulating power-driven  [np6,5-0] game. If you don't dare to play them, no problem, there are more wonderful[np6,4-0] item[np3,2-]. [sn2,s]In the Marine Land, you can see kinds of fishes. The Marine Land  [vp3,3-2] include Wave Cove, Ocean Theatre, Shark Aquarium, Atoll Reel, etc. In the  [fm1,-] Ocan [fm1,-]Theatre, the whale, Miss Hai Wei  [vp3,3-1] perform  [vp3,2-]wonderfully. In the Wave Cove, Shark Aquarium, Atoll Reel, you'll feel as if you  [vp8,3-3] are in the ocean. The fishes [np5,-]are swimming by your side. Besides, you can visit Lowland Gardens, Bird Paradise and Middle Kingdom. I like Hong Kong! 
 Sep. 29 Sunday Sunny 
The new terrn [fm1,-]  [vp6,3-9] had started. It made us very tired.  [sn2,s] Because there are a lot of matters waiting for us, such as much homework, preparing lessons, doing exercises, and so on. There are so many heavy duties that I can't relax. So every Sunday, I go to relax. Guess where I went these days. Went shopping? To see friends? You're all wrong. In fact, I went to have English lessons. The teacher is the famours [fm1,-] man, Stone Cliz. He is very friendly. And he  [vp3,2-1] teach well. Some of his students show their English. It's perfect! I hope I can say "So do I" one  [fm1,-] say. So I make up my mind, I'll tried my best![sn1,s] 
Oct.6  Sunday   Sunny 
Our family lived in Guangzhou for many years. And for many years, Guangzhou was a good place to[vp1,4-0]live. The streets  [vp6,2-1] are [vp6,-]clean. The parks were safe. The people were friendly. But Guangzhou changed. Today the streets aren't clean. The parks aren't safe. The population is increasing. The reason [pr5,2-3] which  [vp6,3-3]  [wd3,3-2] made this change is the other provinces people.[sn8,s] They thought Guangzhou is a very good place to make money. So lots of them  [vp6,4-2] came to Guangzhou to work. The increasing population  [vp6,3-2] made rubbish increase,  [fm3,-] Because not all of them can be invited so some people go to steal or rob. This  [vp6,1-1] made Guangzhou not safe. I think they are too disgusting to stay here. 
 Oct.12 Saturday Sunny 
Strong Teachers
 Today is the day which we [vp6,5-5] had waited for a long time. The  [fm1,-] sporters [fm1,-] and other students prepared for everything, attended the sports  [wd3,1-0] meeting happyly[fm1,-]. This sports meeting is especially wonderful. [sn2,s] Because the teachers also attended the sports meeting. For example, our Chinese teacher Mr Zhu shot put, our English teacher Miss Lin shot put, too. And our history teacher, maths teacher, chemistry teacher and physics teacher ran. We were[sn8,-s] difficult to imagine that  [wd7,0-2] out gentle teacher would [wd4,1-2]  so strong on the sports ground ! In the end, Mr Zhu won the champion. 
  Our teacher who  [wd7,3-1] relaid [fm1,-] race got No.1. Our physics teacher won the second place in long  [np6,2-0] jump. Though other teachers haven't won any  [np6,2-0] prize, they are still worth praising. You are the best! Our lovely teachers! Oct.19 Saturday Sunny I have ever heard something interesting about two presidents (I don't remember if this is their position) of England and the United States. One day, the two presidents made an appoiment [fm1,-] with each other. When they were talking, the American president wanted to go to toilet, so he said, "Excuse me, where's John?" John meant toilet in America. But the English president didn't know. He answered,"John? No one is called 'John' here."... Oh, what an interesting thing! ct.26 Saturday Sunny Half a month ago, Miss Lin and Mr Yang came. After half a month, they left us. On the day that they said good-bye to us, all of us were unhappy. And we sent them two cards and presents. They were moved. Miss  Lin gave us a letter with tears in her eyes. Mr Yang wrote several sentences on the blackboard, " I go quietly, as I came quietly. I waved my sleeve, and took away the rosy clouds." Don't be so sad, our teachers. We'll meet again some day. And we'll not forget you. Nov.2 Saturday Sunny Easier said than done "Jack!" Jack's mother called out in the kitchen. "Don't watch TV any more. You must go over for your tomorrow's test." "Don't worry, Mum. English is very easy for me." But a few days later, the teacher announced that Jack had failed in the exam. It is always easier to be said than to be done. If you don't go over the lessons, you won't get a good grade. Hard work leads to success. You won't say "that's easy" before you do. Remember, easier said than done!  [fm1,-] ov.23 Saturday Sunny The sport that I like I didn't like sport formerly[wd3,4-0]. But I like watching sports match. 
 Because I admire the  [fm1,-] sporters[fm2,-]. [sn7,-]I began to like sports since  [vp6,5-3] I'm in grade two. Because I began to play table tennis and volleyball. I found them very amusing. But they are not my favourate [fm1,-]sports. I like playing badminton best. It can keep me fit, make me happy.  [sn2,s] And it [wd4,1-5]  also good for our health. I'm trying to like other sports. 
 Nov.30 Saturday Sunny
 English is the most widely spoken in the world. It is spoken as a first language by people in the United States, England, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. But it is also very useful in many other countries in the world. If you travel in India, or France, or Germany, or any other  [np6,2-0] country, you will be able to speak English. It is used by people all over the world. That's why we are learning English in China. It is one of the world's most important languages because it is so widely used. So we must learn English hard.

 The Professor And His Invention Professor 
Hunter was very excited that morning because he had just finished the papers of his invention. And he was going to give his invention to the government. One day, two men from London were going to take his invention papers to the government. But on their way to the Professor's Office, they were shut by two cheats. The two cheats wanted to  [cc3,5-2] cheat the invention and sell it. so [fm3,- ]they went to the office imposting [fm1,-]the two man from London. But Professor Hunter didn't trust them because their action  [vp3,1-0] were so strange. So he gave another paper to them . And he decided to take his papers to London himself in order that his papers wouldn't be cheat [wd3,3-1] again. Dec.14 Saturday Sunny Don't waste time Some students often waste their time. They spent too much of their time in playing games, watching TV and doing other things. But they didn't understand they had done wrong. And they said that they didn't have enough time to do their homework and prepare their lessons. They didn't know how to make good use of their time at all. Many people know that time is life. Time  [vp3,1-1] pass quickly. And time is very precious. We must take care of time and remember that time is more precious than money.   The Winter Holiday [sn9,-]Every student always [wd5,2-5] wishes to have a holiday. Because there is so much homework to do. It's so tiresome. Now, the Winter Holiday comes, and the homework comes together .We had thought to relax in the holiday. But the dream is brokn[fm1,-]. Though I'll do it carefully. I must study hard  [ad1,4-0] always. I hope I can make progress in the next term. 
 The Spring Festival 
The Spring Festival comes. It makes people so happy. They can visit their old  [np6,2-0] friend, eat many  [np5,2-0] food, and wear new clothes. The children are [aj3,3-0] happiest. Because they can get much lucky-money. [sn2,s] Then they can buy some  [np6,1-3] toy or some food. So they always follow their parents to go here and there . But when they grow up, they won't do  [fm2,-] that again. Because they feel shy. [sn2,s] Later, they will give lucky-money to the children instead of  [vp5,2-1] get lucky-money. Over 2000 years ago, there lived a farmer in the State of Song. In his field stood the stump of a tree. One day while the farmer was ploughing[fm2,-], he saw a hare, it was running fast across his field. [sn1,s]Suddenly the hare bumped against the stump, and died on the ground. Then the farmer put down his plough, hurried to walk up to the stump and picked it up. He was very happy. From then on, the farmer stayed at the stump, he wanted to  [vp1,0-3] wait the hare  [vp5,3-2] die from bumping the stump again. [sn1,s]He waited and waited. To his disappointment, no  [np6,1-2] hare come again. 


 It was raining this morning. This afternoon I was on my way to [wd4,4-2]  aunt's home. And I saw a woman with a little boy near e. An old woman was waiking [fm1,-] in front of us. The street was wet and slippery. Suddenly the granny fell down. The little boy ran to help her and took her to the other side of the road with the woman. Then when the granny felt well to thank them, the little boy's face turned red. They helped the granny get on the bus and went away. What a kind boy he is! 
 Today is sunny. My mother  [vp1,0-4] goes to shopping with me. We're going to shangxiajiu street. Shangxiajiu street is the first street where we can walk on foot in Guang Zhou. Many shops are opened from morning till night. They are doing good business. On the street, there are some monopoly shops. As the saying goes, "Eat in Guang Zhou." So the food of the Guang Zhou Hotel  [vp3,6-1] are delicious. There is onluy [fm1,-]one book shop on the street. It's so unfair! Books are very important to us. Book  [np6,1-4] shop should be built  more[wd1,s-]! Guang Zhou is coming [fm2,-]stronger and stronger. 
 March 15   Saturday    Sunny 
Which ache do you fear most? Headache or others? But to me, it's toothache. I think toothache is so bad. It maked [fm2,-]me have unclear enunciation because my tongue would touch my swelling gum. It makes me depressed because smiling  [vp6,5-0] was so difficult to me at that time. And the most trouble thing is that I couldn't eat more food. I was so poor that I had suffered severely from a lingerling [fm1,-] toothache for one and a half weeks! My friends! You must take good care of  [pr4,4-1] you teeth. 
April 13       Sunday       Rainy 
Some students would be sad when they got a bad result in the exam. They usually scold themselves, "Why did I get such a result?" "How foolish I am!"... But in fact, can this improve their score? The answer must be "No". At this time, what they must do is to study harder. They must  [cc3,2-3]listen to the lesson more carefully, go over the text, and do more exercises. "Everyday is a new day." Don't be sad for  [pr4,4-3] you failure any more. Be active in our studying, and you will be successful! 
 April 20         Sunday      Cloudy 
Many students have their idols3,[sn9,-] Most of them are the  [np6,2-2] singer in Hong Kong. These days, many singers in Hong Kong sing very bad. But there are still many fans  [vp5,5-1] support them. [sn8,s] Why they are so popular? They just depend on their  [np6,1-0] face, their  [np6,1-0] body, their clothes, their hair, and so on. But can they know  [sn8,3-2] what is music? I think they should do more practice, and struck their fans with their good voice. May 8 Dear Jane, I come to see you today but you happened to be out. Tomorrow is Lily's birthday. Today I come and invite you to attend her birthday party. It will be  [fm2,-] hold tomorrow afternoon. We'll be happy for your coming.

 Our school -- The Nanzhu Middle School was set up in 1961. It [vp6,6-1] is difficult for the children in the village nearby to go to school at that time. That's why our school was set up.

 I think June is one of the best months in one year. This afternoon, the tempareture [fm1,-] was nearly 30 centigrade. I saw seven to eight children swimming in the river . Most of them were good at swimming. A little girl was  [vp1,4-1] learning swimming, and her mother was teaching her. I remember that I often went swimming when I was young. I spent my holiday in Beijing about ten years ago. It was the last time that I swam. <ST 2> <SEX ?> <Y ?><SCH GZMS4> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC ?> <TYP 2>

 Nov. 1st 
We were having an English lesson by Li Yang's follower in the afternoon on Thursday. We could feel the spirit of Li Yang's studing [fm1,-] English: Crazy. His conviction is : In order to speak good English, I could make up my mind to  [vp5,1-0] listened ,  [vp5,2-5] repeated and  [vp5,3-3] shouted again and again. We seldom speak on[pp2,-1] class  [pp2,5-1] at  [wd2, 1-0] usual, but Li Yang's spirit gave us confidence and the way to  [vp5,3-1] studied English. I thought that was useful for our study.

The Spring Festival 
In the New Year's Eve, the clock struck twelve. It announced the 1997, a new year has arrived. I was eighteen years old this year. In the new year, I wished everything would be better, [sn9,-] everyone [fm3,-]would [wd4,1-1] happy. [sn8,s]Although the Spring Festival was [cc4,4-2] cold and rainy from time to time, [cj1,12-4] but [sn7,s]the people didn't mind. Look! The businessman was selling the sweets for [pp1,-2]the year to the people. The children were very happy. Perhaps they got a new toy or  [np6,0-2] a [np3-2]new clothes. At night, a smoke-flower show was showed on the Zhujiang river. When I watched this show on TV, I wished this year would be beautiful as the smoke-flower. 
 My winter holiday 
My winter holiday wasn't very good. The weather was cold and rainy. A lot of sports and  [np6,5-2] game were canceled. I have to  [vp5,3-2] stayed at home. But I wasn't free, [sn9,-]I [wd4,1-4]  made up the missed lessons and  [np5,3-0]  snowledges [fm1,-]that I lost  in[wd5,-] last term and finished the homework for  [np6,4-0] holiday. In the Spring Festival, my cousins and I had a good time in my grandparents' home. We only regreted [fm1,-] that we could not play the smoke-flower and firecrackers. The winter  [wd3,2-2] holiday was short, but I felt happy yet[wd5,3-0]. 
  Over eating and drinking 
The day which I stayed at grandparents' home with my cousin is the happest [fm1,-] day. But it was [np7,2-2] a " unfortunate" day for me too. I ate too much. When I  [vp6,5-3] go back to[wd5,2-1] home, I had a stomachache. I went to the toilet several times that night. The feeling was not good. I couldn't have  [np5,3-2] a greasy food in two days. I would remember this thing and  [vp9,0-4] dare not to  [fm2,-] over  [vp5,4-1] eating again. 
 Buy book
 Before  [fm3,-] Several years  [np7,2-1] the people didn't like buying  [np6,3-0] book in the Spring Festival. [sn4,0-9] Beacuse [fm1,-]the "  [np4,2-1] book"'s pronunciation was the same as the "lose". [sn2,s]But this year was different, [sn9,-] [fm3,-]  [np7,0-4] the peope [fm1,-]like buying [np6,4-4] book in the Spring Festival. In the buying book centre [cc4,3-]of Tian He, a lot of people  [vp6, 12-2] was buying  [np6,2-0] book. They don't think this is taboo. It announced [wd3,2-4]   [np7,2-1] the knowledge was important in  [np7,2-2] the people's heart[wd3,2-0] and  [np7,0-2] the people's idea was changed. Den Xiao Ping's Death 
Den Xiao Ping, the outstanding leader of our country died on Feb. 19, 1997. He is the designer of socialism reformation and modernize[wd2,3-1] building. It is [fm2,-] DenXiaoPing that  [vp3,2-8] make  [np7,1-2] the people live a warm and full living[wd3,5-].  Hong Kong and Macao can [vp9,s]come back to china[fm3,-] because of his theory of "Two  [np6,1-3] system in one country". With his trying, the relation between  [fm3,-] china and  [np7,5-2] the other countries were improved. Chinese economy's developing was looked with new eyes by the developed  [np6,2-0] country and the developing  [np6,2-0] country. So the chinese  [fm3,-]people were very sad when we heard the news of Den's death. Each of us would remember him for ever . A student as we are, we will study hard in order that we can make our country become a rich, strong,  [wd7,4-1] culture country at an early date. This is comrade Den's hope too. [fm2,-] DenXiaoPing will immortalize! 
  "Black" board 
Some changes  [vp6,2-2] had taken place in the blackboard of our classroom. The blackboard  [vp6,2-4] was not black and   [vp6,4-1] turn white. Teachers  [vp6,1-3] didn't need to write on the blackboard in chalk. The chalk's powder [vp6,3-2] didn't fly everywhere. It could keep the teachers and students healthy.  [cj1,0-10] Although it has some little [wd3,3-5] problems in the class sometimes, but I think it unimportant.  [fm3,-] we will  [vp1,2-1] comefort [fm1,-] and like it before long. 
Hong Kong comes back  
Hong Kong will come back to  china [fm3,-]after one hundred days. A lot of places in china  [fm3,-] were  [vp6,6-1]congratulating[wd3,-].

All over the country and  [fm2,-]  [np4,0-1] Hong Kong's people are going to welcome  [fm2,-] Hong Kong's coming back together. 
Environmental Protection
 We have written the compositons [fm1,-] of environmental protection this month. We  [vp6,1-8] had  ever [ad3,-]written the composition in the winter holiday. During the course of writing  [np6,5-0] composition I have read a lot of materials. They make me know the situations of the earth environment . Our environment was no good than before and the natural resources [vp3,3-4] was reduced day by day.  [np7,0-7] The people didn't pay attention to environment protection. I often see that some rubbish such as peel plastic bag were thew [fm2,-]away by some people on the street. As we know, a beautiful environment was closely  [vp7,5-2] linked our living. It's important for us to protect the environment [sn9,-]  Don't destory [fm1,-] the environment again! Let's make a beautiful environment for our living! 
 Computers
  When Charles Babbage, a professor of mathematics at Cambridge University, invented the first computer in 1812 . [sn2,s] He  [vp9,1-1] couldn't imagined  [vp4,1-] the situation of computer in[pp1,-1] today. Now nearly everything in the world even [ad1,-1]controlled [vp7,-]by the computer. Computers are being used more and more widely in many domains. They can control machines in factories, manage amount in  [np6,3-0] company, serve people in  [np6,3-0] family. Computers can do many things we can do and do it faster and better. There are many  [fm1,-]  [np1,1-1] cmputers [fm1,-]  [np6,2-3] company in the world such as IBM , Intel, Microsoft, COMPAQ, AST are creating new softs [fm1,-] for the people incessantly. Many changes are  [vp7,3-4] taken place in our living . Just as IBM said: "A short step or a long step will be a great step in the world." 
  Tennis
 In recent years, tennis has become a very popular sport and tennis has sprung up in many places. Tennis is a skillful sport.  [sn8,0-11] It's not only examine  [np7,4-2] the people's skill but also the physical strength. People who play  [np7,3-1] the tennis must judge the  [np4,3-1] balls direction and consider how [wd4,2-1]  play so that his opponent can not prevent.  Sometimes the match was very long. It's time to test the player's physical strength and endurance. He who has more endurance will win. I was watching a tennis match between M.   Chang and P. RAFRER in SALEM OPEN 1997 HONGKONG on Sunday. M. Chang was well known by the people in Asia. This was a wonderful match. M. Chang displayed very good[ad2,1-]. But when M. Chang  [vp9,2-2] will win after his last ball in second  [np6,6-0] game. [sn9,-]it [fm3,-]began to rain. The match has to stop. [fm3,-]the last ball which  [fm2,-] may be  [vp3,4-2] decide the winner,[sn9,-] [sn2,s]It was a pity. 
 Singing Match 
There was a Singing Match in our school yard on Friday. A lot of students went to watch it. Fourteen singers were going to get the honor of "Ten  [np6,1-3] Singer in school yard". They were selected from lots of singers in the first match. On the programme of the school radio station, every singer introduced himself (herself) and shaved their power. After class, He Zhi Jiang and I went to the meeting-room. When we reached there, the match had begun. Every singer was singing their lovely song at first.  Then they were tested their music feeling.

 The new basketball ground 
A new basketball ground has been built in our school. Many students played basketball after class. Today we are having a PE lesson on the new ground. After doing exercises, we can play basketball.

But it is still an interesting game. I'll like it more and more. 
Mouse
 The mouse is not a lovely animal. It can eat our food, gnaw everything it can gnaw, destory [fm1,-] the crops and spread the  [np6,1-0] sickness. People hated it very much. I hated it too. Because there was a little mouse at my home recently. [sn2,s]It often flees here and there. The bird which I raised was afraid of the little mouse.  [sn2,0-6] Because the mouse often runs after it. [sn2,s]The mouse was nmot [fm1,-]hood [fm1,-]thing lor [fm1,-]our living. [sn8,s]We must get rid of it. 
flea [fm3,-]market 
"Flea market" was a strange word for the Chinese people in the past. But flea market was known by more and more people recently. It was held in a lot of places. I thought the man who invented the flea market was a great economist. By this means, many things which would be thrown away or put into the storehouse can be recycled.  On Monday, a flea market was held in our school. The students sold their things which they didn't need. There  [vp3,1-2] is reference books, toiesam [fm1,-]magazines, handiworks CD, VCD to be sold.

Our teachers are excellent and they are strict with their students. The students respect the teachers. Swindler My father bought some dry scallops on Sunday morning. But when we have lunch at my grandparent's home, my grandmother said that the dry scallops may be false. Because she saw someone cheated by the bad pedlar[fm1,-]. [sn2,s] At night, my father watered the dry scallops and put them into the soup. The soup  [fm2,-] tastied [fm1,-] bad and we found the scallops were flase[fm1,-]. It was clam meat!  [fm3,-] we were very angry. If I meet the pedlar[fm1,-], I will expose his swindle.

I had several tests this week. But I got the same result-the bad result. I was very sad, I couldn't tell the others. My English was not improved at all.

I thought I didn't work hard enough. And I would try  best later on. I remembered [wd4,7-1] one day, Miss Lin talked to us seriously. I must treat [wd3,2-2]  the fact.

So the professor gave the wrong papers to em[fm1,-]. It show [vp6,1-5]  that the professor was clever though he was so old. At last, he decided to take the invention papers to London himself. 
Songs 
Songs are important for [pp1,3-2]the people. When they are tired they are unhappy, they listen to the songs. they will eel better. There are many good songs for us to listen, such as Jeff's Don't be afraid of my sadness and I'll be here waiting and o on. Not only Jeff's songs but also Jecket's songs are good, especially Jecket's old songs. When you hear these songs. [sn2,s]you'll feel very happy and excited. And when you learn to sing these songs. [sn2,s]You will think that you are a real singer. Today, songs are popular for [pp1,3-2]  the people. And many people come to like the [np7,1-1]  music. Antarctic The Antarctic is all ice [np1,2-] all the year round. The warmest [wd3,0-1]  temperature ever recorded there is zero at the South Pole. Explorers used to think that a place so cold that [wd5,9-6]  would have a heavy snow fall. But there is less than ten inches of snow [fm2,-]falls each year and less than half an inch of water. The little snow falls in Antarctica [fm1,-] never melts [vp3,9-0]. It continues to pile up deeper [wd3,5-2] and deeper. When the snow get [vp3, 3-6]  to be about eighty feet deep it is turned [vp7,2-2] to ice by [wd3,0-6]  weight of the snow above it. UFO For a long time, people used many ways to find out whether there have [vp1,1-1]  UFO. In these days, we can see something about UFO in TV programme. In TVB programme: A man said: "when [fm3,-]I was driving, I saw a strange thing coming from the sky. It moved owly [fm1,-]. But[wd3,-s] it was very bright that[wd4,-]like a [np7,0-1]  sun. I've never seen this thing. I can conclude it was UFO." Another man said: "When [wd4,1-1] went home., suddently [fm1,-]. there was something strange towards [wd3,4-1]me. It was very bright and big. As I had never seen it. [sn2,s] So I was afraid that I run [sn6,7-1] faster [ad3,10-0]. But it moved faster than me. And hit me in the face. So I felt  [fm2,-]  into the ground..." Whether they are ure [fm1,-]or not, you must think   [vp1,2-2]  it yourself. Manner I think everyone like [vp3,1-2]  a person with good manner  [np6,1-0].And hey hate a person with bad manner [np6, 2-0]. In  [pp1,0-2]  many times, if someone want [vp3,2-5]  to make know  [vp2,7-2]  of sb  [fm2,-]. They will talk to them [pr1,18-0]. And they will judge a person with [pp1,3-3]  the first talking. So a person with good manner [np6,1-0]  will make lots of friends. If a person with good manner [np6,1-0], [sn2,s]he always says: "Good morning, Good buy[fm1,-], Good afternoon," and so on. If a person with bad manner [np6,1-0].[sn2,s] His talking will hurt  [cc3, 3-2]  your ear, and you won't want him to speak any more. So you now why everyone like [vp3,1-2]   a person with good manner [np6,2-0]instead of bad manner [np6,1-0]. Good manner [np6,1-0]  is very helpful for   [pp1,1-1]  us. Now, let's be a person with good manner[np6,1-0].

But not only the flower pattern that [wd4,1-5] made of several kinds of flowers is [vp6,12-1]  beautiful, but also the flower parttern [fm1,-]made of a kind of flower is [vp6,9-1] beautiful. Such as daffodil. [sn2,s] Several daffodils made [vp7,2-1]  together but [wd5,6-5]  also smells [vp6,8-1]  well [wd2,1-0]. There're some flower pattern else [sn8,s-]  is  [vp6,5-3]  [sn8,7-1]  beautiful. The flowers can made [vp7,3-3]  into a house, a ship and so on. They're [vp6,0-2]  all beautiful. So I think [vp6,1-6] it is a good flowers [np1,0-1]  exhibition. Our school[sn9,-] These days, our school is buiding [fm1,-]a basketball playground. About several weeks later, three playgrounds will have been built. At that time, many students would have many place [np3,1-0]  to play. Not only play football but also play basketball. [sn2,s]I think many students in our school like playing basketball. If the new [vp6,2-10]  basketball playground is built. They will play it so well that the basketball team in our school will be well known. Our school is not only building a playground, but also building a laboratory building. It will be a large building and after it is built, many student [np6,1-0] will have many places to study. At that time , our school will has a new look. Everying [fm1,-]is change [vp7,2-0] [sn9,-] You can see that everything is hanged [vp7,2-2] in GuangZhou [fm2,-]  if you notice it in our [pr1,5-2]  spare time. Last several years, old houses and low buildings everywhere [sn2,s-]. The streets were so dirty. And the pulblic [fm1,-]things, such as public telephones, buses and so on are [vp6,11-2]so little [wd3,13-0]. It liked[wd7,-3] an old bird. Now, as the science is devolop [vp7, 4-0]. GuangZhou  [fm2,-]  is putting on a new shirt and having a new look. Old houses and low buildings disappear. New buildings are everywhere. The streets are so wild [sn9,-]are not so dirty. [sn2,s]And the public telephones are here and there. The high [fm2,-] ways connected [vp5,5-7]  GuangZhou [fm2,-] with the [np7,0-2] other citys  [fm2,-]  is [vp3,17-1] build [fm2,-]. Now, GuangZhou likes [wd2,1-] a flying bird. 
 Danger! 
 We all depend on the earth. But do you know how many [np8,1-1]  energy wasted one day by the people? If you know this, you must think [vp8,6-6]  that the earth is facing danger! Every time [ad1,s]the energy is wasted everywhere. Such as America, China, India and so on are wasting [sn8,9-2]every time. But he energy wasted in America one year is more than the energy used in all the Area [wd7,6-0] ! Now, the energy in  [pp1,0-2]  the earth is reduced widely [wd3,2-0].It is to said  [vp2,3-1]  that we have not any more energy to use. And we must keep [wd3, -2]  the energy for us, for all the people, [wd4,s-] for the mankind. If everyone in [wd3,0-2]  the earth think [vp3,7-1]  so. I think the earth can be saved. 
 Keep the balance of nature 
As we all know, the people [wd3,1-8] in [wd3,0-2]  the earth are creasing fast. They need many things for their living So more and more factorys [fm2,-]  are built. And much more heavy smoke are [vp3,4-1]  produced so that the air turns dirty. The trees are cut by the people. That the greens are reduced every year. [sn2,s] As we all know, trees like to "eat" heavy smoke. Now, many trees are cut. The heavy smoke are [vp3,-]getting more and more. This smoke does great harm to our health. It can make me [wd3,3-1]  ill. Every year, many people die for [vp2,1-0]  smoke. And smoke does great harm to the animals. If he trees still cut [vp7,4-5]  more and more very year. The smoke will do more and more harm to us. So we must plant many trees. [sn9,-]Not to cut trees. It's [vp2,0-2]  to you: we must keep the balance of nature. Obey the rules It's very danger [wd2,2-0]  for a driver to stop the car suddently [fm1,-]on the road. Because if the bus stop [vp3,3-0]  suddently [fm1,-]. Other drivers may not be response [wd2,5-2]  in time. Then the buses will hit together. This was one thing I had saw   [fm2,-] : when a car ran to the gate of the shop. [sn9,-]Suddently [fm1,-], the car stop [vp6,2-0]. The bus behind the car seemed to hit the car! Fortunately, the driver in the bus responsed [fm1,-]fast. Do you know what happend[fm1,-]? A traffic-policeman drove a motor [fm2,-]near to [wd5,8-2]  the car. Then [wd4,1-8] gave "a piece of dry cow [wd7,4-0] " to the driver. [wd4,0-6] said that he had broken the traffic-rules. The will not be given the "dry cow"[wd7,1-]. And the accident will not take place. 
  Blackboard and whiteboard
 Do you know which is better, blackboard or whiteboard? Maybe students say: "We all like blackboard. Because we can see the words clearly on the blackboard. [sn2,s] And our eyes will not be tired after we have seen [wd3,9-5]  it for a long time." But the whiteboard do [vp3,2-5]  great harm to our eyes. If we just have seen [wd3,3-6]  the whiteboard for a short time. We will feel if [wd5,3-4]our eyes are tired. That's to say: We benefited from the blackboard. But on the other hand, the board is vantage[fm2,-]. If the teacher writes words on it. [sn2,s] The blackboard [wd7,1-9]  gives off the dust less than the blackboard does. But there's [vp3,0-3]  only few students like [vp5,7-1]  whiteboard. Many students like blackboard including e, Do you? 
 Catch the mouse 
I live in the fifth storey [fm1,-]. But there are several ice in my house. Do you know why? Now, Let me tell you. The mouse can climb the wall. So the mouse can climb into my house. I hate them because they eat my food and others.[sn8,s]  So I use many way [np3,1-0]  to catch them. This night, I saw a mouse running into the desk. I decided to catch it. So I put the boxes and woods [wd7,4-3]  around the desk in order to make a hold [wd3,2-0]. After hat, I put a big bottle in front of the hold [wd3,8-0]. But the mouse was very clever. It stayed inside the desk. So I had an idea. I knocked at the box. Perhaps the mouse was very frighten [fm2,-].It ran fast into the bottle. So I smiled and said: "Hey, mouse, this time you must die!"  To save the time Do you know how can [wd1,4-4]  we save many times? That's not a difficult thing. Before we do a thing. [sn2,s] We should make a plan. Do you know why? Because if a person makes a plan before he does something. [sn2,s] When he does this. He will do it easily. That's to say: he will save many times [np5,1-0]. But someone asks this question: "If we make a plan before we do something. We may lose many times [np5,1-0]. And it will make us annoy. So we don't like this way and we won't use it." In fact, their thinking is wrong. They don't know that to make a plan will lose [sn8,5-3]  us some time but we well [fm2, -]  save many times [np5,1-0]  if we male [fm1,-]  a plan! As e all know: Time is life. Time is money. It's important for us to save the time [np7,1-0]. Let's do it now! 
 Something strange
 There is something strange or funny arounds [fm2,-]us. If you try to care for [vp2,5-5]  it in your spare time. You will notice some strange things and you will get some happy [wd2,2-0]. Have you seen a man wears a head-helmet when he is riding a bike? And when he is riding, he makes some voice [wd3,2-0]like the sounds that [wd4,-]given [wd3,-]out from the motor. Many people in the street look at him. But he doesn't feel trouble  [wd2,1-0]. He goes on with what he is doing. Do you think he is a strange man? [sn8,s]Have you seen a man wears [vp4,3-2] Western- styled [fm2,-] clothes but on his white   shoes? I think if you see it. You must [vp8,1-5] be not held [fm1,-]laughing.[sn8,s]Besides these, there are many strange thing [np6,2-] around us. If you notice it [pr3,3-0], you will get much happy[aj3,-]! 
    Go to school
 This was Thursday evening. It was raining hard en I went to school. On my way to school. [sn2,s] I thought: Will the street to [wd4,2-1]  school [wd4,7-2] covered with water? If it is covered with water, how can [wd3,1-2]  I do? When I was thinking.[sn7,-] I had already arrived at the corner of the street. I saw many people was [vp3,2-5]  coming out of the street [sn9, -]  shoes in hand. So I realized what was happing [fm1,-]. I had to go to school because my books were at school [np7,4-0]. o I went through the street on my bike. But this was a badly done. [sn8,s]Because of the deep water.[sn9,-] When [fm3,-]I went  [wd3, 2-2]  to school.[sn9,-] My [fm3,-]shoes had already filled[vp7,4-2]with water. So I thought I was so silly. But something changed my mind. When I was in classroom [np7,4-0]. I saw Xiu Qing coming into the classroom wore [vp4,8-3]  his leather shoes. And his leather hoes were filled with water too! What do you like best? There are four seasons in a year. Spring , summer, autumn and winter. Every season has its own characteristic. For example, in spring, trees and flowers grow up and the weather is nice. In winter, the weather is cold but many people like it. Not only in spring and winter, but also in summer and autumn have their own characteristic. [sn8,s]But not all the people like them altogether [wd3,6-0]. Some people like summer, but they don't like winter. But others are not [fm2,-]. So everyone has different idea about what season he like [vp3,3-2]  very much. Though many people like summer. I don't like it. Because in summer the weather is very hot and the sun is very fiery-hot [fm2,-]. I like autumn very much. because in autumn the sun is shining and the weather is nice. This [wd4,-] my idea, what about your idea? "big [fm3,-]worm"[sn9,-] One day I saw [cc3,1-5]something interesting in the newspaper. 
 That was such a thing: 
It's deep into the night. Suddently [fm1,-]  a policeman heard the telephone bell ring. When he picked up the telephone he heard a girl crying and said [sn6, 6-5] : "Is that 119?There is a big worm in my house. It is horrible. I am very afraid." After the telephone, the policeman ought it stranged [fm1,-]  . So they sent four policemen to the girl's home. When the reached the girl's house.[sn2,s-] They saw the girl trembling at the corner. The girl was crying [vp6,2-]  and said: "big worm, big worm." The policeman asked: "where? where?" The girl pointed to [pp1,1-1]  everywhere. After a long time. The policeman found the "big worm". The "worm" was like a silk worm. If you aren't attentive in [wd3,1-1]  it. you can't see it. After they killed the "big worm".[sn2,s] The girl said: "Thank you. " the policemam [fm1,-]said: "This is our position [wd7, 3-0]  and  pesponsibility [fm1,-]."

A little girl was learning swimming and her mother was teaching her. I usually swam in my childhood. It was the last time for me to swim when I spent my holiday in Beijing about ten years before.  I Think Junuary [fm1,-] is one of the best month in a year.

But he felt very lonely,[sn9,-]he had no friends except an old dog that only made him feel fortunately [cc5,1-0]. He often worried about the footmark and desided [fm1,-]  to go back to go [vp1,12-1]  through.

It was raining hard, but I must to go [vp8,3-2]  out [vp2,3-1]  shopping because we haven't any vegetables.  As soon as I shut my front door, I found that I had [wd4,1-5] my key in the house.

Today I've heard from my old friend. She is one of my good friends among [pp1,0-4]  the past three years.  Though we are in different school now, we still can talk with each other by letters or telephone.  From the interchange[wd3,-], we can know each other's study and life as well as before . Between [pp1,0-4]  the past three years, in the old school we always helped each other on [vp2,5-4]  study as a classmate  [np3,9-0]. And after class, we would have heart-to-heart talks as a good friend [np3,8-0]. To [pp2,0-2] this time, I understood the meaning of "A friend indeed is a friend in need."

A few days ago, when I was hurring [fm1,-] to go home, my bike suddenly broke down I must get it repaired. [sn1,s] But it happened that I had no money with me, and he friends with me had no money, either.

Here [fm3,-]was no time for me to ask her name and which school she was in. For several days I waited in the street to look for her but... I couldn't say "Thank you" to her.

I love plum blossoms, though  [wd4,5-3] have never seen it. Because from anuent [fm1,-]  to modern, countless great writer [np3,2-0]  enjoyed it and writes [sn6, 8-4]  a lot of poems and words win [sn8,17-5]  umiversal [fm1,-] praise to eulogize [fm1,-]  it. In the [np7,1-1]  history, plum blossoms was ever elected to [vp1,5-6]  be the flower of our country. So I have a dream, that [wd4,4-8]  I will see it with my own eyes. 
 Sunday      Oct 27             Sunny 
The new teachers went away in [pp1,0-1]  Friday. All of us didn't want [vp1,4-2]  them left. We liked them very much and looked [vp1,0-4]  them as our friends. On Friday morning, we bought a watch and a toy of bear for them. Then Miss Lin gave us a letter,  she was so excited that she could not keep back her tears. and said [sn6,8-2]  a word. Many classmates couldn't keed [fm1,-]  [vp8,3-3]  back their tears too [wd3,9-0]. At last, Mr Yang said to us: "We were [vp6,1-4]  so thanks [wd2,5-2]  for you . You're our first students in our teacher's lefe [fm1,-]. We will never forget you. Thank you. Though they left, we would usually [wd3,2-5]  think  [vp1,3-2]  them again. Going to the doctor's We only go to the doctors when we are sick. So the [np7,0-8]  doctor makes money only if we are sick.  Consequently isn't it in the doctor's interest to wish everybody were [vp3,4-1]  sick so e can [sn6,8-5]  make a lot of money? I think doctors should only make money if we are healthy, [wd4,0-1] this  way it would be in his interest to keep us healthy. A national insurance program, I think, would achieve this resule [fm1,-] [cc3,2-0]  since doctors can then be encouraged to prevent sickness from occuring [fm1,-] [vp7,3-0]. 
  Sunday                           Sunny 
Sports is good for [pp1,3-1]  us. I like sports very much. I like playing basketball. It is very interesing [fm1,-]and exciting. And it can make me taller.

The Moving [np2,1-1]  Star The moving [np2,1-1]  star is the only star which we can watch it moves with our own eyes[sn8,s-]. It often appears in Summer [fm3,-]and Autumn [fm3,-]. It is heart [vp2,2-3]that the wishes which promise [vp7,3-4]to the moving [np2,1-1]star will be realized. I am very regreted[vp7,2-] that I have never caught sight of it. But I think I will watch it in the future, at that time I will promise [cc3,0-2] my wish. This story of the play happened in [wd3,0-3] a professor's home. Mr Hunter was a funny man. He always forget [vp6,2-6]  sth [fm2,-]  unimportant, but remember [vp6,10-4]  sth [fm2,-] important.

At ten-thirty, two men came for the paper, But Mr Hunter. didn't believe them and gave them other papers. After a while, two policemen came and told professor the two men were cheats. They kidnapped the true [wd3,3-1]  men and took away their cards. But Mr Hunter told them not to worry because he knew the true [wd2,3-0]  at first and gave the men's paper were [sn8,4-2] other papers. This story was funny.

As the story [fm1,-]happened in forest so the music is written with the flavour there, it's mysterious and fascinating. It let [vp3,1-5]  me feel the lion's nature. At [pp1,0-2]  the film the animals are so interesting that I can't left [cc3,2-2]  my eyes. 
 "Lion King" is an excellent film.  We have a maths class. A new teacher who wanted to teacher [wd2,6-3]  at our school was coming. He came into the class [wd3,4-0]  and begaining [fm2,-]  [sn6,8-4]  to teacher [wd2, 6-0]  the lesson. When he said the "M" all of us were [vp6,8-1]  laughing.

He taught. the lesson slowly, but we couldn't understand hat he said. Time goes [vp6,1-1]  fast. The bell rang. The teacher felt regretted [wd3,3-0]. He signed to us with his hand : "The lesson is over. My cousin wanted to have a daughter like [sn8,7-2]  his wife. A baby was born in a month age [wd7,7-0]. She's a girl.  Yesterday my cousin came back with his daughter. That's my first time see [vp5,4-1]  her. She's [vp6,0-3]  a pretty baby, She looks quite small. and hands short.

Now is already October 1995. I have already studied at the No.4 middle school for a month. We have many subjects. Study [wd3,1-3]  is very tired [aj4,4-]. Many students are well in any [wd3,-]subjects in my class. They are study [vp6,3-2]  very hard. After school or after class, the always ask teachers questions. Sometimes they stay at school until the sun was[vp7,-2] went down. So our teachers often praised [vp6,5-1]  them. Then the teachers' praise have greatly encouraged [vp3,6-1]  them.

 October 14, 1995
  About five week later, we will be the middle test of the term. [s8,s]Time is money for me. I learned too bad [adj1,1-]for all the subject. I make up my mind to study hard again and again, but I always [ad1,-] can not   do this. I believe through my hard [wd4,3-]  that [wd5,3-]  I can win at last. So I opened my books and went over the knowledges [np5,4-]  [wd3,4-]. There are too difficult. [sn8,s]  I was [wd5,2-5]  often questione [fm1,-]  to my classmates.

It is [vp6, 2-2] too bad truely[cc6,1-]. Then I had to harder and harder to study.[sn8,s]  If not do this, [sn2,4-]  I will leave my classmates. It is [vp6,2-5]  the worst matter for me. I feel that study [wd3,4-3]  is too hard. There are many people [pr1,-]study very well near me.[sn8,s] So I make up my mind to keep up with them. I belived [vp6,2-9]  [fm1,-]  "Where there is a will, there is a way." 
October 21, 1995. 
Today, all of the students went to the sport [np6,-]ground [wd3,1-]  for the sport [wd3,1-]  meeting of our school.

  After the middle test of this term,[sn8,s]  I could see my 2"??(r)| , and I was sad very much [ad2,5-]. Because I felt study [wd3,1-5]  was very hard for me. For example, English and chemistry, [sn2,5-] [sn9,-]   Before this term, I was good at these two subjects. However, now, my grammer [fm1,-]and idiom was [vp3,5-2]  too bad. But I think [wd4, 2-6]  others could learn it [pr1,1-]  so well, then I could [wd4,2-2]  like this [pr1,1-] , too.[sn8,s]But first I must be[wd4,2-4]? any more. it was [vp6,2-4]  my the largest enemy. For the moment the most important [wd4,3-6]is [wd4,4-5]  do excersices[fm1,-]  more and more[wd1,3-].At[pp2,-2] the class  carefully is surely.[sn8,s] Study's way [wd3,2-]  is the most important for everybody.

 March 23, 1996 
This week, we learned a test [wd3,2-], it's [vp6,2-6]  The 1,000,000 Bank-Note of Mark Twain -- the [np7, -2]  famuns [fm1,-]  writer in America. A man almost [wd5,3-2]  in rags get [vp6,6-4]  to a tailor's shop. he wanted to buy a new suit, he have [vp6,2-2]  no money but a million-pound note. A fellow looked him up and down, then finished his work, at last selected a[np7,-1] cheapest clothes for him. And laugh [vp6,2-2] at him. [sn2,s]Until he know [vp6,3-]  this man had a million-pound note. [sn2,s]he wanted to find the best clothes. He found [wd3,2-2]  and found [wd3,4-] , [sn9,-]  finally [fm3,-] , it was founded [wd3,3-].The shop assitant[fm1,-]said [sn9,-]"Do me the favor to put [vp4,2-]on this shirt, and this suit. Ah, it's just the thing, the very thing!?-" This story tell [vp3,3-5]us "Money first' in somewhere[wd7,-]. If you have many [np8,4-1]money, then you will have anything. On the contrary, you have no money, so all the person [np6,4-2]were coldly.[sn8,s] My frist [fm1,-]teacher[sn9,-] I'm sixteen years old now. During my studying [wd3,3-1]life, there are [vp6,2-2]many teacher[wd6,4-]. I want to say [wd3,4-4]  about my first teacher. In the Primary [fm3,-]School [fm3,-] , Miss Zhong was my class head [fm2,-]. She is [vp6,2-3]  a young woman. In the first time[pp2,3-], she told us she was thirty years old that year. In the years that followed, we knew that he [wd3,1-]  taught Chinese and she always was very kind of [wd3,6-1]  us. In the following two years, she never angrily [wd2,3-2]  for [wd3,4-1]  us. [sn2,5-]  She always smiled. 
  To we were Great[fm1,-1] Three, [sn2,5-]  Miss Zhong left us. We stated [fm1,-]  to know some new teachers. I remembered clearly, I had studied in the school for six years. In the Spring Holiday [np6,3-] , she asked me to her office at once. She gave me some cards and said "Happy new [fm3,-]  year [fm3,-] " to me. Everything time[cc1,1-] I was happily [wd2,3-]  and thankful. Now, I missed her very much. Sometimes, I went back to the school and saw her. She was still kind of [wd3,5-2]  her pupils and more beautiful [sn8,s-].   Today was very hot. At about half past seven in the morning, I got up. The sun was shining. People walked quickly in the street. For this Summer Holiday, today is [vp6,2-3]  the second day. I wanted to go to swim. So I phone [vp6,s-] all my old school friends. At nine o'clock. I went to the swimming-pool by bike. At the same time, I met John, my goods[fm1,-] friend for ten years. Later, John, Mike, Mary. [sn2,4-] They reached there, too. We were [wd3,2-6]  hand by hand [np2,3-]  into it [pr1,1-]  together. We could see the wated [fm1,-]  was green and clear. Some friend [np6,2-]  couldn't help jumping and laughing, [sn9,-]  they jumped into it at once .The others went to get some foods [np5,1-]  and soft-drinks, put them near the swimming pool. At last, we were jumped [wd5,3-3]  into the water at all.[sn8,s] About two years [wd3,3-1]  late [wd3,4-] ,we felt tired and hungry, so some were had [sn8,-]  a rest and said something to together. [sn8,s-]  Today, Everything [fm3,-]was beautiful. My old school friend asked me to her home. She said the [wd5,1-]  she will gave [vp6,3-3]  me a happiness [wd3,1-]. So I was surprise[wd2,-]. I want [fm1,-] to her home at once. When I walked in, I saw a dog. He shouted at me. At this time [wd3,3-] , my friend came out, [fm3,-]  She asked me with a smile [sn9,-]  "What do you think?" I answered. [sn9,-]  "That's great." Soon, we came in the house. My friend told me that the dog was sent [wd3,4-4]  by her brother's friend. They named him "QQ". I felt that "QQ' was very interesting. he liked sleep [wd2,3-]  on people's legs and alway [fm1,-]  took the books on the floor. Because he was only two years old, he must to [wd5,1-]  drink milk. he [fm3,-]  loved smell[vp4,1-]  the flowers and like [vp6,1-3]the white's particularly. [sn8,s]So my friend's parents put the white flowers near his house." [sn9,-]In this day, "QQ" [wd4,1-5]  already very kind of [wd3, 5-1]  me and we made friend-ship [wd3,-]. When I left, he followed me to the door. It [pr1,1-]  likes used [vp5,-]  the tail to say good-bye to me. 
 In this Summer holiday, if you walk on a street, you will find some interesting things. In the shop, it [pr1,1-]  became large and more modernary [fm1,-]. In the windows of children's clothes, some perents [fm1,-] with their children looked through the windows. [sn8,s]Their children always [wd5,3-5]  ran and jump around it. They picked out [wd5,1-]  the latest modes [wd3,3-]  of [wd3,1-1]  them and told their father or mother.[sn2,s] Soon, with the new clothes, everyone left happily. On the roadside, there are some people. Everyday they came [vp6,3-2]  here early. Some are buying something, some are seeing  [wd3,3-] , some are the boss [sn6,4-]. I find that the clothes [wd4,2-4]  more beautiful than before. Of course some are much [wd3,3-1]  expensive. But all the people would wish nice themselves.[sn8,s]  So they never make them disappointed together[wd3,-]. China's four modenizations [fm1,-]  will be reality[np7,-]. People's living conditions is [vp3,4-1]  improving. We belive [fm1,-]that our country must [vp9,3-2] be lovely [cc6,-1] better in the future. 
  The new term have [vp3,4-1]  come [vp6,5-3]  [wd3,5-]  three weeks ago. As we grew up, we can [vp9,2-1]  feel knowledge is very important for every one. We can [vp9,2-1]  know that we would [wd4,2-2]  very busy in the coming days. First, we must go to school in the evening though it rains hardly [wd3,3-] , and on Saturday -- the weekend, we must also to [wd5,1-]  go o school all day long. You can find a lot of students study [vp5-]harder than before. You will find in these day [np6, 3-] , classmates have become friendly. Teachers are working harder. So we felt thankful for it [pr1,1-]. In [wd3,1-3]  the teacher's day, every class in our school all [wd5,1-]  are [vp3, 7-3]  buy [vp6,8-2]  some presents for our dear teachers. When we sent it [pr1,1-]  to our teachers, they looked happily [wd2, 1-]  and suprised[fm1,-]. In our heart, we hoped our teachers can [vp9,3-3]  [wd4,3-3]  beautiful and beautiful [aj3,3-] , become younger and younger.  [sn8,s-] they must be tired for us, So [wd4,1-1]  hope them happy in [wd5,1-]  everyday.[sn2,s] Today, I phoned [wd5,1-1]  called my goods [fm1,-]  friend -- the old classmate of the Primary School. We have not seen [wd3, 4-4]  for a long time. So today, we felt having many words but could not say something [wd3,1-].  He said [wd3,2-3]  about the person [np6,2-]  and something [wd3,1-3]  we had remembered. Much [np8,1-4]  of the old classmates had changed. Surely, concluding us. [sn2,s]We remembered what happed [fm1,-]  between us all those day [np6,2-]. Though the [wd5,1-1]  time pass [vp6,4-1]  by. [sn9,-]We [fm3,-]felt many [wd3,3-5]  of the felling [fm1,-]  have changed [vp3,8-2]  each other,[sn8,s] but we could not forget [wd4,-] "we are [vp6,2-2]  good friends."   We never said "forever", but we both know [vp6,4-]  that the friend-ship [fm1,-]  grows [vp6,3-3]  up [wd5,4-2]  with us, with the following [wd3,3-1]  days. 
 Yesterday, I read an account [wd3,4-]  that teach [vp6,4-1]  people how to write with a pen on paper. I felt that it is [vp6,2-1]  useful for me after I read it.  First, It taugh [fm1,-]  us how to pick a [np7,1-1]  ordinary pen for writing. It said that a thicker pen fiter [fm1,-]  more than the [wd5,1-1]  others. It takes [vp6,2-1]  us about a month to grasp a new pen's use [cc3,5-]. It told person [cc3,3-] , we [pr1,4-]  can [vp7,2-4]  copy books'[pr4,-] good points.  Chinese characters is [vp3,3-]  very interesting. If our handwriting is good, so it [pr1,1-2]  is [vp6,2-1]  good for our study or work. Some people's handwriting was [vp6,4-2]  very good. Not only be paised [fm1,-] by others, but also improve their D?D?. [sn2,s]  We can see that, it is important to learn to write. My handwriting was bad. So I make up my mind to learn to write. When my handwriting was [vp6,4-1]  good, I think I can receive intereting[fm1,-]  [cc3,6-]. Yesterday, the two teachers of practice [vp1,1-] of our class left us. They said good-bye to us. At that time, many of the students could not keep back their tears. All of us have felt [vp6,5-1]  sad. Because, the teachers have got well with [vp2, 6-1]  us for these days. Not only at [pp2,-2]the class, but also after class. Before they left us, we sent the presents to them. o the boy [wd3,3-4]  was a beautiful watch, and to[wd3,3-4] the girl was a lovely toy. So they felt happy. As the teacher's [np4,3-1]  letter was read in the class. [sn2,s]  Student's couldn't keep back their tears again. [sn8,s]I think all the person [np6,3-3]  are [wd5,6-2]  have feeling [np6,6-]. Nobody likes "Good-bye [fm3,-] ' But it was the ality [fm1,-]for us. So we must keep back our tears at the quick speed[cc4,3-],and study harder than before. It is the best present for our teachers. 
 I like swimming very much, because it can keep me fit. When you [wd4,2-4] in the swimming-pool, you [wd4,1-3]  through the water, the feeling was [vp6,3-1]  good, you will feel soft. [cc5,-] I kow [fm1,-]  two kinds of swimming. I remembered, when I was six years old, my father went to the swimming pool with me once a week. In that [wd3,2-1]  days, I always feel [vp6,3-2]  very happy. When I saw the water, I will jumped [fm1,-]. When I jumped into the water, I felt highest [ad3,-][wd7,-]than before. I think, keep on from swimming was good at our body. [sn8,s-]  So I will like it last[wd7,-]. Morning excersises [fm1,-] [np4,2-1]  match has been [vp6,5-1]  on in our grade this Tuesday. There are four classes in our grade. Everybody was [wd3,2-5]  hard to do it best. It seemed that it was possibly [wd2,3-2]  for us. After the second lesson in the morning.[sn9,-]We [fm3,-]ran to the playgroud [fm1,-]  of our school at once that like 100 metre race.[sn,s]  When the music began, we had already prepared [vp2,4-1]  it [pr1,5-]. [sn9,5-3] in our class , we held our head high and stood at attention. Soon after [wd4,2-] ,the match realy [fm1,-] began. All of us do [vp6,4-2]  it [pr1,1-]  carefully.  During the match, we can [wd5,2-1]  saw that the teachers who saw us nodded with smile. I thought that we must do it perfectly. After [wd4,1-1]  match, [wd4,-4]  head of our class paised [fm1,-] us for it. Miss bai  [fm3,-]  was happy and satisfied for [vp2,2-1]  it [pr1,3-]. Sports are very useful and important for keep [vp4, 3-2]  people's health. So we must do with it like this match after it [pr1,5-]  [sn8,s-]. Professor Hunter was very excited that morning because he had just finished the papers of his invention. And he was going to give his invention to the government. There will be [vp6,3-2]  the men from he [fm1,-]  government should be [wd4, 2-2]  Professor's office to take his papers to London.[sn,s]  There is [vp6,2-6]  half an hour to the time of they booked [wd7,5-].  [sn8,s-]  Two men came here. They said they are [vp6,4-3]  from the government, and they seemed to be too [wd3, 4-1]  nervous and were too anxious to leave. So the Professor give [vp6,3-1]  them some papers from his books. And the two men left. It is [vp6,2-3]  about eleven o'clock, the time of they are   .[sn2,s] Two policemen came in. They said that the men were impostors. They kidnapped the right men from London and took away their cards, hen they've stolen [vp6,3-2]  the invention. [wd4, 1-] professor smiled and said, the papers that [wd4,3-2]  give vp6,4-1]  them were wrong. The papers of his invention were still in [wd3,8-2]  his desk. Finally, [wd4,-1] professor decided to take the papers to London himself. 
 My English was not well [wd2,5-]. In fact, my pronunciation was not bad. But it seems not to improve my English. [sn8,s]My English's [pr4,-] base [wd3,3-2] was bad. I am used to [vp2,4-3]  forget the words, and it is difficulty [wd2, 3-2]  to grasp the grammer [fm1,-] and some of the idioms for me. My English is too limited. I never forced myself to learn it. For example, Once, I kept up my mind [vp2,5-3]to read aloud the text every morning. It took me about ten to fifteen munites[fm1,-]. The first morning. I was happily to do that. This situation lasted seaval [fm1,-] days. In [wd3,1-3]  the fifth day , I felt that is [vp6,4-2]  too much for me, So I didn't stick to it. Before long, I forgot it. Lazy [wd2,15-]  is my the [wd5,1-] most  [wd3,1-1]  shortcoming. I thought that [wd4,3-1]  must be [wd5,1-]  get rid of it.[sn8,s]  otherwise, [fm3,-]  it must  [vp9,2-4]  effect me very much. 
My Winter Holiday [np6,3-]  
The winter holiday [np6,3-3] was very short. It is [vp6,2-4]  at least[wd3,-]  two weeks. Except [wd3,1-3]the Spring Festerval[fm1,-], it is [vp6,2-3]  about seven days to study.[sn8,s]  So it almost not a "holiday". I know [vp6,2-]  that is [vp6,2-3]  the important time for us to study. Teathers [fm1,-] often said that study n fact is [vp6,3-1]  this. [sn8,s-]  In this holiday, I often remember [wd3,-]to go over my lessons.   Because I made up my mind to study hard this term. [sn2,s]I noticed everyone studies [vp6,4-2]  very hard in the days before this holiday. 'Where, [sn9,-]  there is a will, there is a way.' I said to myself many times. But I found that is [vp6,2-4]  the most important thing to do everything is [vp6,2-1]  hard.  [sn8,s-]  I was very lazy in my study. So after the test, they could smiled [vp6,1-]  aloud [cc5,4-]  from their hearts. Although I was [vp6,2-3]  not very clever, I will go on to study hard in this term. 
 The Spring Festerval [fm1,-] 
 At [wd3,1-2]  the night before  [sn9,3-3] "The Spring Festerval [fm1,-][sn9,-]",my perant [np6,2-][fm1,-],and me walk [vp6,5-3] [wd3,5-3]"the flower street". It is  [vp6,2-3]  near my home, then very *1/2? for me. At [wd3, 1-2]  the street, There [fm3,-]are [vp6,2-4]  many flowers in  [wd5,1-1]  it [wd5,1-]. Some are [vp6,2-1]  red, some are [vp6,2-1]  yellow, some are [vp6,2-4]  green and so on. All sorts of them more beautiful than ever. [sn2,s]  My family bought some flowers for our home. Although the night was raining , [cc2,2-] people much more than before [sn2,5-]. In [wd3,1-2] the Festerval [fm1,-] , I stayed at home almost every day. Because the whether was very cold and I wanted to [wd4,3-2]  in bed instead. But I phone [wd5,2-1]  call [vp6,2-2]  my friends to say "Happy new [fm3,-]  year [fm3,-] !" to them. At my home, it is [vp6,2-2]  very warm,  I was lazy to out [sn8,5-]. Sometimes, my old school friends called [vp1,-]me, and said some beautiful words to me. It is [vp6,2-4]  much happier for me.[sn8,s]  I wish all the people who I knew "Happy new [fm3,-]  year [fm3,-] ". Before the Spring Festerval [fm1,-] , my friend do [vp6,3-1]  [wd3,3-1]  shopping with me. In the street, we could see the people who looked excited. Many flowers and oranges was [vp3, 57-] put at the gate of the shops. It [pr1,1-3]  looked beautiful. In the shops, my friends and me wanted to buy something, but all the things [wd4,3-2]  very expensive. Some of the clothes very "in" and "?". [sn2,7-]  For the Spring Festerval [fm1,-] , we must buy some clothes or anything else. At the end of the time [pp1,5-], we bought much [wd3,3-1] something [wd3,-]to eat after [wd5,1-1]all [wd5,1-].[sn8,s] We jumped, ran, smiled aloud [cc5,2-]  in the street. I seemed as if we had not seen anybody. [sn8,s]  At the age of seventeen, it [wd5,1-4]  is the beautiful [aj3,s-] age of [wd3,4-]  every one. We will remember this age at [wd3,1-2]  our life. I remembered the days that my old school friends had played at [wd3,1-2]  the streets and roads with me liked at that time. [sn8,s] At the day [wd3,-], we were all younger than today. We were about six years old. We smiled and smiled, all through everywhere that we had passed. At the end of this holiday, tomorrow [wd7,-4]  will go to school, the term will be begun [vp1,5-]. At this [pr1,-]time, I feel excited and a little frightened. Put the text books in my gands.[fm1,-][sn9,-] I read the words one by one. It could make me happy. I could [vp9,2-1]  know that would be [wd5,3-3]  become my knowledge.I read the texts louder [cc5,5-4]  as nobody [wd4, 1-2]  near me. I was careful in it [pr1,5-].[sn8,s] Sometimes, [sn9,-]I turn on the radio and listen to the songs or the DJ's voice voice [wd5,1-]. It can make me mopre [fm1,-]  relaxing [aj4,4-]  then ever. I liked the songs which I felt beautiful,. Wxpecially [fm1,-]  the songs of [wd3,3-1]  Englilsh [fm1,-]. Altough [fm1,-] some of them I could not understand all about it. [sn8, s-] I liked them which the music sounded well.[sn8,s]  "Say you, say me","Right here waiting" "Unchained Melody" "Nothing's gonna change my love for you" "Casablance[fm1,-] " and so on. [sn2,s]  In the years that followed [sn9,-] I wish everyday [cc3,3-3]  happier than ever. With times [np5,2-2]  go [vp4,3-1]  by, our study has become [cc2,4-3]  busier and busier. All of the students [fm1,-] in our grade have studied [vp6,9-5]  harder and harder than ever. In [pp1,-]the lessons , we take an ative [fm1,-][vp2,3-]in put [vp5,1-] up our hands to answer the questions. Although we are very busy, we still care for our health. After a [wd5,2-1] class, most of us will have a rest or go out of the classroom. We don't stay in [wd4,1-1]  classroom to read the textbook any more. 
  For being tired, how could we ? [sn2,s]  After school, we come home later. At home, Surely we go on with our study late into the night. Our teachers and parents worry a bit for [wd3, 4-1]  it [pr1,4-]. It is important for us to listen carefully in the class. If we could do it really [ad1,6-] , it is [vp6, 2-6]  not too difficulty [wd2,1-]  to study well. Teachers often tell this to us.  We didn't used [sn8,-]  to believe it. But [wd5,1-]  when we do it for sometime, [sn8,7-]  we could [vp9,2-4]  find it was true. my [fm3,-]  friends, [sn9,-]  make [vp6,1-3]  up our [np4,5-1]  mind to study hard in these more than one year,[sn8,s] and stick [vp6,1-3]  to do this [pr1,4-].Don't give up when our [pr1,-]fail. We must believe that "Where, [sn9,1-4] there is a will, there is way[np7,-]. " and prove it. 
  After this Labour Day, we went to school again. In the classroom, everyone looks [vp6,2-3]  better then ever. Perhaps, in the holiday, each of us paid attention to sleeping, food and so on. So it can find [cc2,3-]  that a [wd5,1-2]  good sleep and good food was [vp6,6-6]  important for men's health and works [np5,1-]. It's being [vp6,2-1]  fine today. Then it makes our feeling not bad.[sn8,s]In class, nobody notices some beautiful birds out of the windows not any longer. [sn9,-]  On the contrary, we did our best to listen carefully that [wd5,-]what the teacher had said. Teachers look [vp6,2-5]  happy for we [sn8,s-] do this, and then made up their mind to make us study better then before.  [sn8,s] English is an interesting thing [wd3,5-].
 I like it, but I always feel hard in it.   I think I must use my head [wd3,5-2]  to think that [wd5,1-]  what shall[wd1,1-2]I do and be good at it. First, I must encourage myself and in front of the mirror [ad1,5-]  to say to myself "Don't give up." every morning[sn8,s-]. Our school is a key school. It has a history of seventy years. Many students who graduated in [wd3,3-2]  our school became famous. Now our school has thirty-six classrooms. There are one thouands [fm1,-] and  eight hundred students and more than two hundred teachers in it. It has two teaching building [np6,1-] , a [np7,1-2]  experiment building [np2,2-]  and a big playground. Students do exercises in it. All the teachers in our school are excellent. They are always trick [fm1,-]  with us and we respect them. There are less than a hard [wd7,2-1]  month to [wd3,8-5]  the graduation examine for us. In our grade, most of the students study harder and harder, and the nearer [wd7,-]the harder. Teachers and we [pr1,2-]devote ourselves to study. Sometimes our teachers [wd4,3-3]  eagerer [aj3,3-2]  than us. Somtimes [fm1,-] , we study hard to [wd3,4-2]  the [wd5,1-1]  midnight. then [fm3,-]  in [wd3,1-2]  the day, we feel asleep [wd2,3-].From then on , we study to night no longer. [sn8,s]At [wd3,1-1]  class we rather listen carefully than study so tired [ad2,3-]. At [wd3,1-1]  class, students listen more careful [wd2,4-4]  then any other time. We wish to exam [wd2,-]well.

[sn9,-]I thought that my cousin was poor. One day, I went to the hospital to visit my friend. In the room, I saw a boy feeding rice to his sick mother. He fed so carefully. After the meal, he said to his mother. "Now, let me feed the madicine[fm1,-]  to you, be careful." This made me think of my parents. They care for me very much. But I often quarrel with them.

My English study
It is  [vp6,2-10] already seven years since I began to study English. when I was a pupil of Grade Four, I touched English first time [pp1,1-]. At that time, English seemed interesting to me, and I loved it at once. But after one day an incident changed my mind. It was a small test of English in class, and I hadn't gone over the lesson before.  I always thought that English was easy to study for me.) when the test was over, I was so sad that I had made [vp6,12-2]  the mind  [vp2,16- 2]. After this, I took[wd3,-] my heart into English, and study  [vp6,9-3]  hard and carefully. I have got an English-Chinese dictionary. It is my old frind [fm1,-] for helping my English. And the dictionary is very usful [fm1,-]. I often look up the new words while I read and I can't  [vp6,13- 3] understand the sentence. So It [fm1,-]  not only helps me get the meanings of new words, but also helps me understand an articl [fm1,-]  well. I have many presents. But I like the dictionary best. It has become my good friend as well as my teacher.

Everybody tried their best to go over [sn8,7-1]. But I had filled [vp6,11- 3]  in both test. It [pr1,1-8]  is [vp6,8-8]  the reason that [pr5, 4-4]  why I had filled. The first was that I still didn't try my best to go over [sn8,14- 1]. I was so lazy that I did less [aj3,7-11] exersices [fm1,-]for my study. The other reason was that I cared less in my test. Especially the [wd5,1-2]  physics, though there were such single problems [np3, 5-2] , I had defeated [vp7,9-1]. From the test, there is a lesson for me that I must study hard.

Several days before [wd3,3-11] , I heard that there was a small bookshop nearby 6,8-2]  my school. l the books that is [vp6,5-7]  [vp3,5-7]  old were much cheaper than the others. When I heard of this, I was so happy hat I nearly went to the bookshop at once. Because some of the books which were sold outside do [vp6,10- 5]  not fit us very well, some books which fit [vp6,20- 6]  us but it sell [vp3,2-2] very spensive [fm1,-]. So as a student, we are difficult aj1,6-7] to select and buy a good book. For this, I can't miss the chance. When the classes were over, I went to the bookshop at once. But it is [vp6,2-7] too small for me to find out. I was surprised when found the bookshop. There were so many people in it and everyone put their heart into [vp2,12- 5]  choosing books which they need [vp6,17- 1]. In the end, I was so pleased that I bought some very [wd4,-]books which I need [vp6,13- 1].

From the children, I can [vp6,4-5] see myself in the children. Of course, I was happy as them. At that time, we didn't understand what was unhappy and what was the word "exam" meant [vp7,15-0]. But now, I understand the word quite well. I know because of exam [np6,4-0] , I lose a lot of things which I like. For example, I like to watch TV, and listen to the popular music or go shopping. But now I must go over my lesson at home.[sn9,-] thinking [fm3,-]of my study. I left the window and turned on [cc3,6-2]  my book.

Having true friends isn't an easy thing, and no person can live alone. Recently, I have read a story about a boy suiciding [wd2,-]. Because there was no one to help him when he was in trouble. [sn2,s] He had a lot of friends, but none of them could understand him. He had no true friends, so he had chosen the way to end his young life. If you want to find true friends, at first we [pr1,9-8]  must help others where they are in trouble and need you [pr4,13-1]  help. When you have true friend [np6,4-0] , then you know how beautiful friendship is! Through the story , we can learn a lesson: "A friend in need is a friend indeed!"

But except the nervous study life, we must learn how to relax ourselves [sn8,12-0]. This is the scientific study way. Through the relaxtion[fm1,-], we can control [vp1,2-6]  with our brain better than before.

A letter to my friend Li Li: How are you recently? I haven't heard from you a long time[sn9,-] I  think it is too busy and nervous in our study for us to write to each other. I'll have the experiment examination next week. I am so worried that I can't do it well. Though I have gone over them again ad again this week. But the only thing I can do isn't the worry. It is the hard wek [fm1,-]. I still remember what my old teacher said, she said: [sn1,s]  we must thrust ourselves, nothing can change our mind if we decide to do it well. See?

My New School
Our school is a key school. It is [vp6,1-7]already seventy years since it was formed. And a lot of well-known men graduated from our school. There are thirty-six classes and one thousand eight hundred students in our school. Our school has two teaching buildings and a laboratory building.

We like our school! 
My Future 
Everyone has their [pr3,2-]dream. I decide to become a middle school teacher. I had this dream when I was still a child. I don't think to get on with the children all the time is wasting time. On the contrary, it would be happier to me. We all know, the teachers are badly in need [sn8,8-4]  of in our country, but not so many of us want to be a teacher. The main reason of this is the work of the teachers is too hard and can't [sn6,15-3]  get so much. But I have decided myself [vp1,4-6]  into the education of our country.

It is [vp6,1-11]  about ten years since I swam in Beijing during the holiday. I think June is one of the best months all through a year. Beijing Beijing is the capital of our country. It is one of the oldest cities in the worlds [np6,2-0]. Tian An Men Square lies in the centre of the city. It is the largest square in the world. There are a number of parks in Beijing.

This afternoon, the temperature was nearly 30 degree [np3,5-1]  centigrade. I saw even or eight children swimming in the river. Most of them were good hands at swimming. A girl was learning how to swim , and her mother was teaching her. I often swam in my childhood. About en years ago, when I spent my holidays in Beijing it was my last [wd7,14-1]  swimming. I think June is the best month of the year. 
 The Nanzhu Middle School was built in 1961 in order to settle the problem about the children who couldn't go to the middle school in the villages nearby. At that time, there were only 80 students and 8 teachers in the two junior classes. But now, great changes have taken place. There are 128 teachers and 1538 students in it. There school is made up of 18 junior classes and 12 senior classes. It has a teaching building. A lab building, an office building.[sn2,s]The swimming pool is being built and library [wd4,7-4]  is being added to[sn9,-][sn8,s]

Today is weekend. This week will pass soon. There is much homework and there are few self-study classes this week. We have done cleaning three times. For these, I haven't enough sleep, so I feel tired. I thought I could have a good rest on Saturday and Sunday first. But finally, I [wd5,0-15]  there are three compositions to write and there is more homework to do this weekend. And I have to go over English, physics and geography for we will have a test of each subject next week. When can I have a good rest? I want to do things what I like very much, but is there any time [wd5,4-2]  of chances? It is my first diary writing in English, I am very interested in it. Though there is much homework, I will keep on writing.

Tomorrow will be [wd4,-2] National Day of our homeland. It has founded [vp7,2-3] for 46 years. In the last 46 years, great changes have taken place in China. People's lives have improved much, and our homeland gets more and more beautiful. I must appreciate the national flag deeply. Because sometimes I have no faith for my study, it gives me the courage. hen the national flag rise [vp3, 4-7] , I will feel it encourage me incessantly. Today, I walked on the street, I found there are many national flags along the road, I couldn't help feeling excited! [sn1,s]  Let me say a world [wd3,4-16] , "Mother, happy birthday to you!

     This week, we have had classes for only three days.. However we had tests each day and we have learned much knowledge [cc3,3-]. For example, n the English class, though we were learning Lesson Three all along, we learned much new grammar in it. So feel very instructive [sn8,3-0]. On Thursday, we happened to have a swimming class. Since the weather gets cool now, when we looked own the swimming pool, we all thought the water must be very cold. However it was warm inside. We swam happily. On Friday, he weather suddenly changed at all. It was raining hard and blowing [sn6,5-3]  a strong wind. So it was much colder than before. It has entered into autumn. I like Autumn very much, because it is not noly [fm1,-] a nice season but a harvest-time.

It rained out the day. We were going to do some working [wd3,6-0]  what to clean the classroom in the morning. [sn8,s]As it was raining hard, we didn't do these works [np5,4-0]. Teachers were asked to give classes with [wd3,6-1]  Chinese. Each teacher spoke Chinese the different [wd2,5-0]. They spoke some words didn't agree with the correct pronunciation [sn8,-s]. We couldn't [wd4,2-2] what they said. Chinese is our our [wd6,-]native language, every one of us should learn to say [wd3, 15-2]  it well. [sn1,s] Tomorrow ,we will go to see an instructive film. It will take me much time, so I must finish homework.

 We held a sports-meet in the Workers [np4,2-2]  Stadium today. The sportsmen all tried their best to win honour for their classes. I had written two articles about praising them. Many students also wrote articles, because each one would contend [vp1,3-5]  one mark for each class. The contest was so wonderful that we often couldn't help standing [wd3,-]to watch. On Friday, I met a friend who was studying in Guang Fu Middle School. It was good to see her. When we saw each other, we both rode on a bike. We stopped to talking [vp5,3-0]. We talked bout the study, the life and many interesting things.  encouraged [fm3,-]her to study hard to make a rapid progress, she also encouraged me to keep in [wd3,1-]  studying carefully. We talked for some time and finally we bidded [fm1,-]  farewell to each other.

Winter is coming. The weather gets colder and colder. It didn't stop raining today, so that I had to go to school with raincoat. This week we had had two tests of two subjects. One was English, the other was maths. It's important for me to learn English and maths well, while the mark of English test was not bad for me. I was very disappointed, because I spent three nights in going over the notes and texts. Maybe I did the paper at a slow speed, I felt there wasn't enough time for me to do it. Ever since then, I've learned I must do anything fast. My ant was ill. She was in hospital. She's [pr4,0-4] illess [fm1,-]was so serious that she must have an operation. She was operated on Tuesday. I regretted that I have [vp6,4-10]  no time to see her only because of hard study. I should go to see her sometime surely [ad1,7-0].

We had tests every day this week, the results were not satisfied with me [sn8,s-]. I found that my knowledge was so limited. In order to make good results in the middle [wd3,5-1]  exam, I decided to go over each subject carefully. I knew we would go to the farm to work for a week. That must be interesting and instructive. It was good for me to grasp [wd3,6-4]  the life of farmer. How fast time goes! Half a term passed, the year is also going to pass, and I will be sixteen, I hoped I could [vp9,3-6] go [vp1,7-4] to university after three ears, however [sn1,14-5]  my study was so bad, at the same time I was very discouraged, I [sn1,32-6]  didn't know how to improve it. [sn1,s] I was afraid of the middle [wd3,1-1]  exam after all, but it was the reality, I had to accept [vp1,3-0].

We had had the middle [wd3,1-1]  exam the week before last week [wd5, -0]. After that, we went to the working school to learn to do the farm work. We had earned much work. The most dirty work was to transport the mud f the pool. All of us were covered with mud, but we don't [vp6,9-1]  mind.  needed the [wd5,1-4]  great power o transport, so that we felt very tired. The most interesting work was picnic. Each group was given some pork, some chicken, some eggs and some vegetables and any kitchen-wares. We cooked and have [vp6,3-5]  the picnic on the hill. Though the dish was very bad, we had it with relish [wd3,-].All the things were instructive. We had a good time these days .The life of the working school was hard to forget!

This week teachers all began to teach the new lessons, so that we had to turn back to the nervous state. On Friday evening, school [wd4,3-5] had held a patriarch meeting. My father had been in GuangXi for a week, he went there for work, so my mother attended the meeting. [sn1,s] Mr Zhu gave every parent a result form which was printed the results of every subject of the hold [fm1,-]class. I was the twenty-second in class and the sixty-two [np9,8-3]  in the grade, though [sn1,14-16]  I made a little progress, it was 85 marks between I [pr4,5-5]  and the first after all. [sn1,s]  I knew it was not easy for me to keep up with him, but I would strive for it as an object. I hoped I could make a rapid progress in the final exam. I believed a sentence "A thousand mile trip begins with one step."

Our school's Festival of Art would hold [vp7,6-0]. I had taken part in the match of creating poems and songs. I was not every sure in it [sn8,6-0] , but I would try my best to think. I also took part in the match of reading English, I seldom read at ordinary times, so that [wd5,9-6]  I must read more these days. [sn1,s] Today we went to see a film about the struggle of resisting Japanese. The film's name was "The thing changed in [pp1,0-3]  July the seventh in [pp1,0-3]  Lu Go Bridge", it was the start of the struggle and [sn6,7-2]  was instructive, I knew many history things figures from the film, the Japanese Army's members were free to murdered the Chinese people, I hated them. [sn1,s] The struggle wasn't [vp8,2-8]  hictory [fm1,-]unless [cj1,4-4]  the Chinese Communist Party. I will love the Party and my great country forever. 
 Dec 9th, 1995              Saturday 
The things in is week were all common. I had classes suffering [sn8,3-0]  because the blackboard reflected light, so that [sn7,12-7]  I couldn't look at the blackboard clearly. I hoped Mr Zhu regulated [wd7,4-7]  the seats as early as he could. I had been in that place for [wd4,7-1] long tie [fm1,-]. At the same time, I also hoped there were some window curtains on the southern windows. I thought it was good for us to look at the blackboard and have classes well. I was on duty yesterday. When I swept the floor, I found there was much thick dust on the surface of the floor. I wondered if the floor was swept the last days[pp1,2-]. Didn't they want to have classes in a good environment? And our class was also our family, we should keep it clean.

 I would learn Lesson Seven, which named [vp4,1-3]  "The Emperor's Clothes". It was an interesting, instructive and famous story. The story was: Once upon a time there lived an emperor who cared much for fine new clothes. He changed different clothes each hour of the day. One day two cheats who said that they could weave the most beautiful cloth in the world. [sn2,s]They told the emperor the clothes made of it [pr1,27-16] could not be see by the stupid or the men who ere[fm1,-] unfit for their work. The emperor agreed to let hem make the invisible clothes in other [wd3,11-13]  to find out which men in his empire was unfit for his offices. The cheats were given some gold , beautiful silk and the best thread. They pretended to weave cloth very hard. During the days, the emperor asked some officials to go into the hall and see the new clothes. But they all could see nothing. Then they thought [wd4,3-7] were stupid or were unfit for their work. They told the emperor the clothes was excellent in order to let him not [wd1,5-7]  know they were unfit for their work. Finally, the new clothes was "finished". The emperor "saw" it and sing  [vp3,3-]high praise for it. In fact , he saw nothing. How foolish the emperor was! He believed he cheats at all [cc5,5-0]. He "put" on the few clothes and walked down the road. He knew he was cheated until the people beside the road cried he wore nothing, there wasn't a new clothes on him. [sn1,s] But the emperor still held his head, the two officials who were following him even pretend [vp6,17-6]to hold up the emperor's train. [sn1,s]

I took part [pp1,-]the matches of the art festival, which were to create the poems and songs and to read aloud the English. I passed the matches after all. Though I wrote the poems and songs and read aloud the English not [sn8,12-2]  very well. I hoped I could gain the marks or my class. In fact, marks were not important for me. I believed the most important thing was to try bravely, to be a fearless fighter. I ought to try to do more things in order to get along with everything. Tomorrow will be Christmas[fm1,-][fm3,-]. I received many cards of christmas [fm1,-] [fm3,-]from my friends. I also sent some cards to them. I like the [wd5,2-3]  New Year's Day more than the [wd5,0-1]  christmas[fm1,-] [fm3,-], because I have the holiday in [pp1, 5-3]  New Year's Day but not on christmas[fm1,-] [fm3,-].

My grandma has moved near my house recently. Both her house and my house are the highest of the building [sn8,11-7] , so it's not convenient to see her. I have to see her once a week. The teachers of geography, history and computer had begun to work on writing the outlines for us to go over. I heard the final exam would be on on the last days of this month, and this time we would have eight subjects' exams together. It was very hard to go over every subjects [np3,1-1]  well. The physics teacher told us that she had no time to help us go over the lesson. Physics is the hardest for e to study. I was afraid I would not pass the physics exam. But I ought to get rid of the thinking, [wd4,-s] try my best to do best. Jun 13th,1996  Saturday[sn9,-] cloudy [fm3,-][sn9,-]Now I will rite the end of the story about the emperor's new clothes. The prossion [fm1,-]  continued. The emperor still held his head high. But the people by the street cried louder and louder. More and more people agreed with the child. The emperor became angry though he felt very silly. He ordered to stop the prossion [fm1, -]  sudently [fm1,-]  and cried loud, "Be quiet!" The people topped crying and they began to be frightened with [pp1,5-2]  the emperor. The emperor said angrily "Yes, I was cheated by the cheats. But why didn't you tell me early? It proved all my officials were unfit for their work and they were not honest for [pp1,4-1]  me". Then he faced the officals[fm1,-]. In fact, everyone laughed at the emperor by heart when they heard that, including the officials. None of them said a word. Of course the officals [fm1,-]didn't see the emperor with one eye [sn8,10-0]. At last, the child shouted, [sn9,-] at the emperor "You don't like [sn8,12-7]  an emperor! You just like [sn8,19-2]  a fool! Ha..." Then most of the people took up his words and they also aid the emperor knew his [pr4,3-3]  made a mistake, but he didn't accept [wd3,3-7]  the mistake because he was an emperor, instead he wanted to drive off the people and the officals[fm1,-]. He cried, " How dare you said [vp9,3-1]  that! Now, I order you, "Get out"! Don't lived [vp9,1-3]  in this empire!" The people and the officials were also angry, they took awy [fm1,-]  everything from the palace and left the empire right away. [sn1,s]  When the emperor found him wrong, it was so late. Ever since then, he had nothing to wear, nothing to eat and had no money, he was the only one in the empire. By and by, he died. Mar 8th, 1996          Friday      Cloudy[sn9,-] Today is the women's day. This afternoon we didn't have classes, thus I had a bit pleasures [wd7,s-].

I went to Tian He Bookshop with my cousins and my aunt, we saw a foreign [wd1,-2]lovely baby who sat in cradle, he laughed towards us. [sn1,s] We all felt very interesting. I also had met my old classmates, [wd4,7-2] my old teachers. It was so happy or me to see them. In the Spring Festival, I didn't [vp2,1-5]  afraid of he cold weather, I dressed [wd3,1-3]  the beautiful clothing and wore a air of new shoes to visit the relatives and friends. My purpose is not to get lucky money I'd [sn7,8-4] like to see them. As soon as I went to school, I felt a week went slowly. I thought that was because of hard work, the winter holiday went fast because of pleasure. Now I see, the life of school is instructive and happy actually.

She spoke wonderfully. She might ready [wd4,2-8]enough and must be giving [cc3,2-3]  herself much courage. She wasn't like a new teacher at all, instead, she looked as if she had taught for a few years. Her sight let us be a bit frightened, so we were not dare [vp9,4-4]to talk in lass. I tought [fm1,-]she must be selected [vp1,3-8]the teacher in the No.4 Middle School. All the grade were working on preparing the debate match, which was going to be on on Monday afternoon.

After we visited the martyrs' mausoleum, we had a match of rowing boats. The students who attended the match all tried their best to row. At[pp2,-2] the first, our classmates rowed the fastest. I thought we could win at last. After some minutes, the boats returned. One, two......None of them were ours. To our surprise, the other three boats had reached the riverside, our oat hadn't gone through the bridge have yet. [sn1,s] A long time passed, our boat was driven towards the riverside.

 I had learned [vp6,2-8]  Lesson Thirteen, now let me retell the text. One day Robinson Crusoe caught sight of the footprint of a man's [np4,4-3]  in the sand while he was walking along the sands towards his boat. The island was very silent[ad2,1-], Crusoe wondered if there were some savages there, he looked round. [sn1,s]At last, he could see nothing at all. He stared at the footprint, full of fear. He hurried to step into his cave, and stayed there for some days. He dare not go out and look for food. But no savages came. He decided to go out again after a time. But just then his old ill dog which was his only friend died. Crusoe felt very lonely. He decided to go back and look [vp2, 6-10]  the footmark again to prove if the footmark was his. He found it wasn't his own. There must be someone elso [fm1,-]on the island. He was terried [fm1,-]  at the result. Crusoe at once did some measures. He built another fence round his cave, made holes in the wall and placed his guns in them, pointing outwards. But he still continued to look for a better hiding-place. He found one in the rock, which was more than twelve feet high and had a narrow entrance. He came into the cave, when he suddenly saw two yes glaring at him out of the darkness, he ran away into the daylight quickly. [sn1,s]After a time, he held a lighted stick to step into the dark cave again. It was the goat's eyes that he had seen. The goat rolled over and died immediately. Crusoe was satisfied with the high dry hiding-place. He placed five guns and much gun-powder there, and made some candles to give light. So he lived on the island for months and years. Every day he climbed to a high rock to keep watch. One morning of autumn, he saw nine savages which were sitting round a fire and eating something were [vp4,17-3]  one the shore. Crusoe was full of fear again. As soon as the savages had gone. [sn2,s]Crusoe made his way down to the shore with two guns to have a look. He went towards the fire, he found the bones of a human being among the ashes! [sn1,s]Crusoe made up mind [wd4,1-]to shoot the savages if they came again, because they killed their enemies and ate them. But ever since then, no one arrived at the island.

There were two festivals this week. One was the International Labour Day, the other was the Youth Day. Thus I had a holiday on May 1st, but at the same time I also had three tests of physics, maths and English. Not being happy for the holiday, I could have a good rest, I could watch TV, I could listen to the radio... On the contrary, was happy that I could go over my homework in the holiday. To my disappointant [fm1,-], the results were all bad. I really didn't want to think about it, but I couldn't set me free unless I wrote the words in my heart. Getting hot, I must wear thinner [sn8,5-0]. These days it often rains hard, so the trees are made greener and greener by the rain.

William's son was brave , he stood one hundred paces down the street, with an apple on his head. [sn1,s] William took up the better arrow, and placed it in his bow. After taking aim at the apple, he let the arrow fly. It split the apple in half! This brave story of William Tell gave the Swiss much pride and courage. So it was not long before the Swiss drove the Austrian from their homeland.

 My first teacher in primery [fm1,-] school was miss Mark. She was over forty. But she often had the [wd5,4-3]  nice dresses on, and wore a little jewelry, so she looked like a young women [np3,6-0]. Miss Mark taught us Chinese, she was our head teacher. For she taught phonetic well, she only taught grade one and two [sn8,11-0]  . During the course of her teaching, the Chinese result [wd3,8-9]  of our class was the best in our grade. That couldn't leave Miss Mark's strict demands [sn8,6-0].

 I've been to Beijing for eight days. This was my first going there. Of course I also [ad1,3-4]  could go by plane. Passed [vp5,0-12]  across the clouds [sn3,5-9] , my feeling seemed that I was wondering the sea. When the sun was falling down, the clouds were more wonderful. They appeared [vp1,1-4]  many kinds of colors: blue, yellow, red, green and some mixed colors. I was very excited to see so many ...splendid clouds. We arrived in Beijing, the capital of China.

Last night, suddenly, there raised [vp1,1-4]  a shout of help, which got around our storey[wd3,-]. We all went out of our homes to see what had happened. Oh! The accident was Mr Lis' quarrelling.

But she didn't cry, she was prostrating on my mother [sn8,9-3] , and was staring. It appeared that she was very tired. A warm family can make each family member happy.

They didn't take [vp2,2-2]  great changes, they [sn1,7-8]  still had many words to talk with me. [sn1,s]The food was very good, but it was not better than our friendship, I was really very happy.

[sn1,s]After all those happy things had passed [vp6,6-7] , I have to face the home work [wd3,6-0]. Though I want to play, I see [vp2,6-8]  study is the most important job for me. I will still accept the fact.

Our practical [cc4,-1]teachers had left in Friday. We sent some presents for them. There were two cards, a watch and a toy animal. They thanked us for supporting their education and giving them so much happiness. They were so excited that tears came to their eyes. I was moving [vp7,12-3]  at that time, but I didn't cry, I  made up my mind to work hard to requite them. [sn1,s]We finally [ad1, 1-5] can have two days' holiday.

I'm not very good at sports. But I like quite a few, such as running, playing table tennis and playing badminton. Though I run slowly, I also like running. Because it can practise [cc3, 7-3] a man's will and can make the muscles of the legs stronger. Table tennis is an interesting, jobful [fm1,-]  and relaxing sport. After a game of it, my mind will be more joyful than before. I also like playing badminton, it can practise all my body, especially the arm, will [sn6,16-3] get more strengthful[fm1,-]. [sn1,s]I'm learning volleyball. It is an exciting game. As the first, [sn9,-] course, I had some pain of [wd3, 4-2]my hands. But that's all right, I will insist on it. Basetball [fm1,-]is a good sport, too. I'm going to go on to learn it when I finish learning volleyball. It has the best [cc4,3-3]  value to me, because it can make me taller.

Professor Hunter was very excited that morning because he had just finished the papers of his invention. And he was going to give his invention to London. The men from the government were going to help Propessor [fm1,-]Hunter take his papers to London. They would come for the papers at eleven. But at ten thirty, two men had come and had got the professor's papers. They weren't the right men. They were the [wd5,21-1]  impostors. All the persons in Professor Hunter's house thought Professor Hunter must be cheated. But to their surprise, he wasn't. He didn't trust the two men. Because hey seemed to be too nervous and were too anxious to leave. And they accepted the papers quickly. It could prove the men to be wrong. So Professor Hunter didn't give the real papers to them. Finally, he decided to take the papers to London himself. Professor Hunter was this way [sn8,4-0], when he did the important thing, he would be very careful. [sn1,s]

There s little time for me to go over all the lessons. So I have to try going over the lessons in very limited time. Hong Kong will come back to our country on July 1st this year. It makes the people of China and of Hong Kong excited. Perhaps the people of Hong Kong will not fit [wd3,8-9]  the new systems at the beginning of the period of coming back .

[sn1,s]This made us very surprise and happy. I think two new teachers aren't much older than us. They must have many ideas and good [cc4,6-1] knowledge.

Everywhere we can find the [wd5,4-1]laughing. I paid attention to every-place[fm2,-]. I was interesting [aj4,2-2]in runing[fm2,-]. All the students ran very fast. Something else is [vp6,8-2]  also interesting. The students who took part in [wd4,5-6]  were very friendly to each other. I will remember this sports meeting for ever. This week we have learned Lesson Five-winter [fm3,-] sleep [fm3,-]. It induced [wd3,1-7]  some animal how [sn7,6-4]  to spent [vp5,4-2]  the winter. I have known [cc3,2-9]  a great of knowledge about these from the lesson. we [fm3,-]  all know the cold blooded animal must hibernate in winter, but do you know some animal [np6,5-0]  need to sleep in summer. [sn9,-]You should be surprised for what's [sn7,5-2]summer sleep. I have ever read a book about the summer sleep. Let me tell you. Because the weather in summer is too hot for some animals to live. [sn2,s]If they movement[wd2,-] all day, they will lose water and be very tried [fm1,-] , until they die from hotten [fm1,-]. For this they had to sleep, but their sleep's [np4, 2-5]  time is shorter than hibernation. They only sleep two or three weeks [sn9,-]then they wake up to find food and water. I have to go to school for six days [sn8,8-3]  in this term. Then I stay at home for only one day. it is Sunday [fm3,-]. How do I spend the Sunday? Let me tell you. In the morning I get up later than usual. I don't get up until eight o'clock. After I have breakfast, I would go over texs [fm1,-] , till half past ten, and then I watch TV. In a week I hardly have time to wathc [fm1,-] TV. Because home words [cc1,2-3]  are too many. In the afternoon I sleep a long time. At four o'clock, I will see football match in [wd3,5-1]  TV. In the night I will go over [wd4,6-1] , too. next [fm3,-]  I go to bed. I didn't like to go out to play. Sometimes I go to library [np6,4-4]  and borrow some books. My Sunday is [wd4,2-1]  that . 
 We had a lesson of English on Friday afternoon. In the floor [cc1,2-2]  meeting room.[sn2,s] It was a young man with glasses that spoke to us. As a speaker he taught us how to study English very well. he [fm3,-]  spoke wonderful [ad2,4-0]  and make me deep feel [cc5,3-4]  English is very nessecry [fm1,-]. What he said" I enjoy Losing Face," let me know English more than before. I decied [fm1,-]  to learn English harder after I heard [wd3,-] this lesson. I think the note Book of Lesson [sn8,6-0]. I think the Note Book of Lesson One " How Karl Marx learn English." And "How Li Yan learn English:" are different in way [wd7,3-0]. I received the back [wd3,3-1]  one [pr1,6-0] , because I think it will fit me. New ways are better than old ways. I think I will beat [cc3,4-3]  English before long. We visited the Xi Zhao Hill last Saturday. We got to Xi Zhao Hill by bus, having two half hours [cc4,-] ride. The Xi Zhao Hill is much larger and highter [fm1,-]  than any other hill in Guang zhou [fm1,-]. That day I had a good time. I saw many things which I hadn't seen before. There are a lot of fairy tales in differently [sn8,8-0]. The Hill is so beautiful that it leads to bring [sn8,9-3]  many people's comeing [fm1,-] , for example: students, peasants, workers, the [wd5,7-2]  foreign friends. But everywhere monry[fm1,-] is the most necessary. People there want many monry [fm1,-] very much. If you reach same place, you must play [cc3,2-4]  some monry [fm1,-]  for visiting, " No monny [fm1,-]No talk" This word is fit for the Hill [sn8,6-0]. 
 If you visit our school, the No. 4 Middle school now, you must feel very surprise [wd2,4-0]. Because you can't see the old school, which you have even [wd3,10-1]  seen. Now our school is changing. Mony [fm1,-]  builting  [fm1,-] have been knocked down. The workers are hard [ad1,3-1]  builting [fm1,-]. All the students try own's [vp2,4-3]  best to help. They give a great deal of good idea [np1,5-0]  [np6,7-0]  in order to make the school more beautiful. The work of rebuilting [fm1,-] the school is all the students and teachers' wish. We hope all of us could live in a quite beautiful great space to earn [cc3,0-1]  knowledge. I think when the school finishs [fm2,-] rebutlling [fm1,-] , I have [vp6,12-2]  left here. I can't see the new school. But I don't regrad [fm1,-]. I will try my best to do with the work. The school will be much beautiful before long. That day isn't very long [wd3,12-0]. 
 Professor Hunter was very excited that morning..... And he was going to give his invention to all over [wd5,10-2]  the world, because of loving all human [np6,4-0]. He would give his invention without [wd3,5-1]  nothing. Two men who were cheats, came to the [wd5,7-7]  Hunter's home and asked for the inventio[fm1,-].But Hunter was very clever and careful in his invention. He found that [wd4,-] two men weren't like the right men. Then he gave the other papers to [wd4,7-1] two men. Later Inspector White[sn9,-] Sergeane[fm1,-] Bull and Miss Green beleived [fm1,-]the papers had Been[fm3,-] rodded [fm1,-]  by [wd4,15-1] two men, they worried about that. [sn1,s]So Hunter Professor [cc1,1-]  told them, the papers of this invention were in his hand. He already have [vp3,2-1]  understood what's happen [vp6,7-0]. He would take the papers to London himself. 
The weather turns colder and colder. The wind blows heavly[fm1,-]. Many people don't want to get up early in the morning. They stay in bed and feel warmer than out of bed. It doesn't [cc3,1-3]  a good thing. Today I learned the nineth [fm1,-]Lesson --- sports and games [fm3,-]. It says sports and games can be of great value, especially to people who work with brains most of the day, and then sports and games build our bodies, prevent us from getting too fat and keep us healthy, they are also very useful for character-training. [sn1,s]We can think how necessary sports and games [wd4,7-0]. We must do more sports, then build our bodies, that we would work harder, love of our's [pr4,-]county to try our best to make it beautiful and strong [sn8,27-0]. In [wd5,0-2]this week, many pople[fm1,-] doesn't be happy.[sn8,s] Because the Chinese football term [fm1,-]  wasn't won [vp1,8-0]  in the football match. China is a larger country, then there are many people. [sn6,s]Most of them all love football very much. Everyone hope [vp3,1-0]  China [np4,4-6]  football term [wd3, 8-6]  win  [vp3,9-3]  in each match. But things doesn't [vp3, 4] decide for people want [sn8,8-0]. Our football term [wd3, 2-0] is weak. I think I can't throw much more wish [cc3,7-3]  in football term [wd3,2-0]. 
 In my studies, there are eight subjues [fm1,-]which have to learn [vp7,7-0]. There are China [wd3,2-2] , Match [wd3,5-0] , English, physics, chemise [fm1,-] , Histray[fm1,-].... I like history best of all these. Our teacher who teach [vp3,3-2]  us history s a men [np3,10-2]  of porties [fm1,-]. He talk [vp3,1-0]  very well. His knowleage [fm1,-]  is like a ea[fm1,-]. I look on him as a good teacher. He taught us nearly [wd4,3-2]  one ear. I have learned many [cc4,3-1]  knowlege [cc3,4-0]  about China or world [np6,3-0].I depended on myself to learn history [wd4,7-0] ago and I didn't hear [cc3,2-2]  teacher's lesson. But now I pay attionsion [fm1,-]  to teacher's lesson. I would put [vp2,2-5]  my heart into the lesson. 
 If you visit our school, the No.4 Middle school you must feel very surprise [wd2,4-0]. Because you can't see the old school, which you have even seen. [sn2,s]Now our school is changing. Many builting [fm1,-]  have been knocked down. The workers are bjuilting [fm1,-]. All the students try own's best to help.[sn8,s] They give a great deal of good idea [np3,7-0] , in order to make the school more beautiful. The work of rebuilting [fm1,-] the school is all the students and teachers' wish. We hope all of us could live in a quite [fm1,-], beautiful, great space to learn knowledge. I think when the school finishs [fm1,-]  rebuiding. I have eft [vp6,11-1]  here. The school will be much beautiful before long. That day sn't very long [wd3,4-0] . 
 The winter holiday was short. It was only two weeks. Many homeword [fm1,-] would be done. I borrowed a lot of books for [wd3,6-1]  laberition [fm1,-]. I read them very carefully, and that [sn6,6-6]  I knew what the world is. Every several days I will go out to play football and basketball with my good friends. Through the playing, I made quite a few and [wd5,5-2]  new friends. Only in the playing lace, I eel happy yet [wd5,8-0]. Before we can't [wd3,2-4]  [vp6,2-0]  be allowed to play football or basketball in school, somebody said that Hay [fm1,-]  sth [fm1,-]in school will harm sb [fm1,-]or sth[fm1,-]. [sn1,s] 
 Now I can play long. [sn8,s] In the winter holiday I do [vp6,5-3]  all the housework, because my mother and father had to go to work, so [wd5,21-3]  I do [vp6,14-1]  everything. Doing good housework is not easy. I feel [vp6,36-2]  very tired. I try [vp6,42-5]  my best to do that. In the two weeks, I think [vp6, 5-0] a lot of thing [np3,3-0] , which I have [vp6,16-2]  to [wd4,6-0] with. 
 The Spring Holiday, which one year is one time, is 1997 this year [sn8,12-0]. In this year, there is a great thing that Hang Kang will be returned to our country. Everyone feel [vp6,1-3]  happy with it. because [fm3,-]  of the reason, this spring holiday is very pleasant. I have eaten a lot of food on [wd3,7-2] several days. Eating too much will make sb [fm1,-]become fat. I am afraid I would turn [vp2,2-3]  a fat boy. But the food are [vp3,3-2]  very good. I don't know how to do. In this year, the goverment [fm1,-] in guang zhou [fm3,-]  [fm3,-]  don't [vp3, 14-7]  allow the people to play a game. The game is playing fire [vp2,4-0].I think it was a [np7,4-2]  interesting game. The children play them with pleasnet [fm1,-]. But the game is a little dange [fm1,-].This year [np1,1-8]  of the Spring holiday is like last year's, there are no new things. [sn1,s]All the people go there and go here all the day except the people whose leg can't walk [cc2,3-0]. I didn't buy some [pr6,-] new clothes or shoes. I care a little interest in it [sn8,6-0]. this [fm3,-]  year is cow [sn8,5-0]. I don't like this animal. 
 I feel unluck [fm1,-] now. My famil [fm1,-] will move in the Match  [fm1,-]. Now my home which I live [vp2,5-2]  is big, through  [fm1,-] it isn't great, it is big. [sn1,s]I have a room for [wd4,5-0] own. I can do everything I like in it. The place where we live is old, it isn't tall. [sn1,s]It well be rebuilt and built tall thing [sn8,7-0]. I don't we would move to where yet till now [sn8,9-0]. I am afraid the place where we move [vp2,7-9]  is very far from my No. 4 Middle school. Oh, if the place is farer [aj3,3-2]  than there. Such will make me very tired. I want to cry. I don't hope that I change the place. 
 The weather turns colder and colder, the wind blows heavly [fm1,-]. [sn1,s] Many people don't want to get up early in the morning. They stay in bed and feel warmer than our [fm1,-] of bed. It isn't a good thing. I learned the Nineth [fm1,-]Lesson--sports and game. It says sports and games can be of great value, especially to people who work with their brains most of the day, and then sports and games build our bodies, prevent us from getting too fat and keep us healthy, they are also very useful for charcter[fm1,-] tranining[fm1,-]. [sn1,s] We can think how necessary sports and games [wd4,7-0]. 
 A bad news came from Beijing in February 1997. Our the [wd5, 1-2]  greatest Leader, comrade Dun Xi Ping is dead. He left among [wd5,2-3]  us for ever. All the country is in sad feeling. Every one [fm1,-] can't help holding [cc3,6-1]  tears, [sn9,-]for the great man's death. His name, which nobody don't [vp3,4-1]  know will stay at [pp1,10-2]  our heart, comrade Don Xi Ping have put his life the throw into revolutionary affairs since he joined the Chinese Party. [sn1,s] He loved all the people of China deeply. All the people of China love him deeply too. I am a student. I decide to try my best to study. Comrade Don Xi Ping hoped that he could see Hong Gong [fm1,-] would return to our country till [wd5,5-2]  one day. but [fm3,-]  he couldn't see with his own eyes. I think he regreted [fm1,-] very much. Our country is getting stronger and stronger, the people are getting richer and richer. [sn1,s]We can't forget comrade Don Xi Ping. It was he who leads [vp6,11-7]  us to go to the new tomorrow. We will miss the great men [np3, 5-8]for ever. He is living in our heart. 
 If you visit our school, the No.4 Middle school you must feel very surprised. Because you can't see the old school, which you have even seen.[sn8,s] Now our school is changing. Many builting [fm1,-] have been knocked down. The worker are [vp3, 2-1] building [vp1,5-0]. All the students try their best to help. They give a great deal of good idea [np6,7-0] , in order to make the school more beautiful. The work of rebuilting [fm1,-]  the school is all the students and teachers' wish. We hope all of us could live in a quite, [sn9,-] beautiful, great space to learn [vp1,16-0]. 
 The weather is quite bad in several weeks. It rains all day and all night. Looking [sn3,0-8]  at the sky, the sky is not blue, it is deeply dark. [sn1,s]The groud [fm1-]is wet. Nobody like [vp3, 1-1]  this. That weather bring [vp3,2-3]  trouble to people. The drivers cannot drive much fastet [fm1,-]than before, if he does so, he must be regreting[fm1,-]. [sn1,s]People [wd4,1-6] rather stay at home than go out, because of heavy rain. The old man must be taken good care of. They [pr3,9-5]  couldn't use [vp2, 4-3]to the weather, the [sn1,10-7]  children also must be looked after well. they'd [fm3,-]  better wear enough clothes to keep the cold out, maybe [wd3,-]they would become ill. 
  It isn't a good thing. Expect the weather to turn good. [sn2,s] our [fm3,-]  school is being rebuilt. Look, there are two new basketball-port [fm1,-]. Before that, our school has not got basketball port [fm1,-]. Basketball is a wild interesting game whose [sn7,6-13]  game the people all the country especially the young man, love very much. [sn8,s]In fact, basketball is a good fun, it can make people strong, bring a good time to people. [sn1,s]The human [wd3,1-5]  who had invented this game is a great man. My classmat [fm1,-] and I also like basketball. They play well and often hold the match. Now we may play basketball at new basketball- port [fm1,-]. 
Last week, the school leader care [vp3,5-4]  more for our class. They sent a new teacher to us. The new teacher names [vp1,3-1]  E. she [fm3,-]  ever taught us health- lesson. She is young, we often see her smile on her face.I found she really [wd4,3-3]  a good teacher. In the morning, she came in our classroom early in order to examin [fm1,-] our morning reading. She alway [fm1,-]says the morning reading is quite important for us to remember the knowledge, we can learn new knowleage [fm1,-]from it, and he is very kind to us. She is more a good friend than a good teacher. 
This sundy [fm1,-], [sn2,s]it isn't a good day because of little rain. My family came to the memorion [fm1,-]. There are more people than last year. But it is not dirty [aj3,4-3]  than last year. The government has ordered not to allow [wd5,6-3]  to burn something [wd3,21-0]. If all the people who came [vp6,-] there do [vp5,9-1]  this, the air will be made very dirty by them. Something are burned, they give off poisonous gases. [sn1,s]All poisonous gases is [vp3,3-3]  harmful for people. The government's order is praised. The people hope like this [sn8,-0]. Our school held the match of the ten-singer. This is a good idea. Many students, who want show their singing take an active part in [vp2,11-0]. there [fm3,-]  are four students in my classroom [wd3,8-0] , they take part in this match. [sn1,s] They all [ad1,1-8]  are sure that they could win the match. At last, only one of them get in the last match. It is Xu Wei feng who goes [vp1,6-3]  on the match. Nobody could think he would win the match. But to our surprise, he won. 
 Leager [fm2,-]mumbers [fm1,-]held a meeting. The subject is about Hong Gang [fm1,-] recoming [fm2,-]. They adviced us to write our own name into a piece of long cloth. All the students take an active part in this. The leager [fm2,-]mumbers [fm1,-]of every class made [vp6,15-7]  a wonderful goods [np1,2-4]  post to Hong Cang [fm1,-]. This prove [vp6,1-1]  that all the students of the No. 4 Middle school [fm3,-]  take good care for [vp2,3-3]  Hong Gong recoming [fm2,-]. We look forward to the day, 7,1 coming [sn3, 8-1]  earlyer [fm1,-]. Our country will become stronger and stronger. 
 I visited the Tong de Garden with my good friends last week. though [fm3,-]  this place is far enough from Guangzhou.[sn2,s] It took us half an hours [np6,5-0]  to got [vp5,1-0]  there. It is wide and great. I think the Tong De Garden is one of the beautiful places. Many building [np3,1-0]  is modern. In[pp1,-6] the both side all kinds of trees and flowers are planted. The people who live there must be very happy. 
  There have [vp2,1-6]  some spots for people having sports. It is really a good place. If someone asks you: " what is more important Chinese or English? " I will answer it is Chinese that is more important than English. Chinese is not only our native language, but also a base of learning the other subjects well. Chinese and English both are difficult to study well, but we make progress more rapid in English than Chinese. So some people would think English is important. When we study English, we have to translate it into Chinese. That inproves [fm1,-]Chinese is more important than English. 
 My new school. Our No.4 middle school [fm3,-] is really a key school, as we all know. Our school has a history of sevetty [fm1,-] years. Our school have [vp3,2-9]  been rebuilt more and more beautiful since it formed.  Now there are thirty six classes in our school, and one thousand eight handred [fm1,-] students and more than two hundred teachers. We are united and friendly. We love our school because it is big and wonderful, around the schoolrooms stand all kinds of trees. [sn1,s]The teachers are good, they are strike [fm1,-] with students. [sn1,s] students [fm3,-]  inspect [wd3,1-1]  teachers. 
 People include [vp4,1-20]  the old, the young, the men and the women, are interested in taking an active part in sports and games. Sports and games are becoming more and more popular in the world. Because they are of great value. They could build our bodies, prevent us from getting too fat and keep us healthy. In our country, a plan is being carried out. The plan named [vp1, 2-11]  " All people in China must practive [fm1,-]  for their body." This plan is welcome. Sports and games are also useful for character training. 
  It is hard to say this because my English is very limited. But sports and game really is [vp3,5-4]  more important than others. Day: Saturday    Date: June. 14.   Weather: very hot (30) Today it is a hot day. At [pp1,2-0] the afternoon the tempeiture [fm1,-]  move [wd3,9-4]  to about thirty centigrade. On my way home, I saw sever [fm1,-] or eight children swimming. They are like fish, and have a good time. A little girl is learning swimming, the teacher who teaches her is her mother. [sn1,s]When I was a child, I often went to swim. I remember that time when I sawm [fm1,-]in [pp1,7-7]  the end was about ten years ago. Then I had a holiday in Beijing. I think that June is [vp6,28-8]  one of the best months in a year.

This lesson tell [vp3,2-3]  us many ways to study English. For example: when a person is learnign [fm1,-]  a foreign language, he must not always be translating everything into his own language. If he does this, it shows he has not mastered it. Now we have just gone into the senior middle school, study [fm3,-] English is felt a bit difficult, but I will keep on studying hard and often ask the teacher [wd4,3-1] some advice on how to study English. At home, I will do [cc3,2-5]  some progress in some time. My teacher, you say all right? [sn8, 5-0] I'm going to do my best to study English. The next day is National Day. And Oct. 1, 2 [wd5,3-4] , is the public's holiday. We are all at home go [vp4,5-3]  over the homework.

At the playground, we have class of P.E. and play all sorts of games after school. We work hard at our lessons and take part in different kinds of activities. Our school life is full of joy. I like our school very much.

The capital of China--Beijing. Beijing is the capital of our country. It is one of the oldest cities in the world. Tian An Men Square lies in the centre of the city.

Books are our friends. Books are our friends because they are bridges [np1,7-2]  to knowledge. Almost all great men in the history of mankind loved books. There is no genius without books. Because books give them knowledge, and knowledge give [vp3,1-2]  them power. If a man didn't read the [wd5,5-1]  books, he is half blind. But it isn't all the books are fit for us to read [sn8,11-0]. We should choose books that not only interest, ... the book for reading is always for fun.[sn2,s] Some books are to be read roughly, but some must be read slowly and carefully. sometimes [fm3,-]  you should take some notes whenever you feel it necessary. When we .. we don't understand questions, we should use the dictionary. Because the dictionary is our best teachers. [sn2,s] Books make us to learn about the past and look forward to the future and learn [cc3,15-4]  a lot of konowledge[fm1,-]. Let books be our good friends all the time.

Time is more valuable than money. People often say: " time is money." But in fact, time is more valuable than money. Perhaps somebady [fm1,-] could ask: " why? " because [fm3,-]  when the money is spent, we can ... it back. [sn2,s]But when the time is lost, it will return of ever [sn8,10-0]. So we shall understand time is very valuable. The time is not only valuable but also limited. Someone ever said: " Time is life; Time is money; time is ...". So every second is precious, we should make [vp2,2-5]  use full of our time, don't waste our time! [sn1,s]Waste the time is waste the life. We should get into the good habit of saving time. Don't put off what can be done today until tomorrow. Let us saving [vp5,2-2]  time together!

 Next week, the senior three's classmates will have exam [np6,8-0]. So we will go to the chemistry lab to have the classes, and the night classes will stop. Though [cj1,0-1]  so, we should stay at home to go over the lessons more carefully. so [fm3,-]  I decide that I will not watch TV, because now our study is very important. We should spend more times [np5,4-3]  in studying lessons. We act [vp2,1-7]  in actually to welcome the graduation exams.

We had lessons in chemistry lab this week, when we came [cc3,2-1]  there, the first day, we hadn't a little habit [sn8,4-0]. Because many classes had P.F. lessons outside, they made a lot of noice [fm1,-][np5,7-0]  and affected [vp1,11-4]  us to head lessons. We should listen [vp1,2-3]  lessons more carefully, but some classmates stood at last, sometimes [sn1,6-5]  they looked at the blackbroad [fm1,-] didn't [sn7,10-1]  clean. They still have lessons attentively. Time went quickly, three days had gone. [sn1,s]We ended our classes in [wd4,5-1] chemistry lab.

We didn't [vp1,1-7] much time to have a good time. In these several days, I went to the library one day, the others[wd3,1-1] days I stayed at home to go over lessons. [sn1,s]But sometimes I also watched TV because I felt studying lessons shouldn't [sn7,4-2]  too tired. After some times [np5,2-5]  you should have a rest, or you went over too much in a short time. You would be difficult [aj1,3-3]  to remember it. I felt [vp1,1-4]  very instructive these days.

Time is very valuable. Time past quickly. We will have exams in about one and a half months. We should make full use of time to study hard. Because time is very valuable. [sn2,s]The time everybody has is limited. But why some people could do more work in limited time, and someone couldn't? because [fm3,-]  they dealt [vp2,2-4]  the time was [sn7,7-1]  different, some people made [vp2,2-3]  full use time to study [vp1,1-2]  on work, and someone spent the time in chatting, gambling or playing. They didn't realize that they were wasting their life. Because time is very valuable, we should fall into the good habit of saving time.

A Diligent Boy. This was a story [sn9,-]once upon a time there lived a boy. [sn1,s] He was fond of reading books. But he was poor so that he had no money to buy any books. So he had to walk a long roads [np3,1-]to borrow books from a rich man. Because he always returned the books on time, the rich man was ready to lend books to him. The boy read a lot of books in this way. At last, he became one of the famous writers. But the rich man's son had only little knowledge. 
 Jun 14. It is about at thirty centigrade. I see eight children swim in the river, and they are almost good at swimming. One girl is learning swimming with her mother. I often swim during my childhood. I have swimming at last in time of having a holiday in Beijing about ten years ago [sn8,16-0]. I think Jun [fm1,-] is one of the best seasons in a year.It is time to have a composition class. After the bell rang, the students took their place [np3,4-0] , waiting for the teacher. But several seconds later, the teacher didn't come. At the time, some students began to talk [vp1,4-2]  each other, some ones [wd5,10-5]  read other books, others [sn1,16-2]  made noises. [sn1,s]Twenty seconds passed, the teacher entered the classroom, but she didn't make a [np7,4-1]  apology. She picked up a piece of chalk, writing on the blackbroad [fm1,-] "Teacher is late". Then she turned back to us and said: this is the topic for this composition.

It was the First [fm3,-] week of this term. And it is [vp6,10-4] a very important week. So, if I want to make a rapid progress, I must do my best.

But some classmate have [vp6,8-2]  some trouble on [vp2,5-3]  doing his work, and havn't [fm1,-]  finished [vp6,11-2]  his work. It wasn't right. The Relation Between A Boy And A Girl By the end of last week, at the political [wd2,1-1]  class, our teacher gave us a talk. She said that we mustn't be in love with any others [pr6,7-]  when we are still students. And boys must keep far from [vp2, 4-1] girls. That made us surprised. Some students laughed and some angered [vp7,s-]. They thought that it was too rigid. Boys and girls must be had sth [fm1,-][sn8,s-]. [sn9,-]go in for [vp2,9-1]together. And like doesn't equal to love.[sn8,s]  So they were [wd3,2-5]  not agree with Miss Bai. But I do think Miss Bai's idea is right, because we are still students. What I Want To Be These days, a question puzzled me for a time, [sn9,-]  The question is what I want to be when I grow up. I want to be a [np7,-1]  engineer, a doctor or a worker, I doesn't [vp3,1-1]  know. But I do know if I don't study hard, I will only become a physical [cc4,-]strength worker.  So I decide to do my best from this week. Don't play so much and do more exercise. My tomorrow is in my hand.

My Birthday 
Of This Year[sn9,-] Today, I came home from school. [sn8,s]Today is the twenty-fifth of October. When I saw the calender I suddenly remembered my rithday [fm1,-]  of this year had passed for two days[sn8,s-]. I was unhappy because my brithday [fm1,-] of this year was deserted[wd3,-].  I remembered I ate cake every year in [pp1,-2]  my brithday [fm1,-] , but this year?- I thought I had grown up, I wasn't a child. [sn1,s]I had to face a lot of difficulties. And I had to try my best to get rid of the difficulties by myself. I am not unhappy now because I have thrown [wd3,-]  up. 
 What's the "flesh" mean? [sn7,s-]  "flesh [fm3,-] " means "beauty" in the [wd5,1-1]  England.   But "flesh" means "rule" in the America.   An Englishman went to America. [sn9,-]  And he atteneded [vp1,2-3]  to a party. He saw a beautiful lady and spoke to her: "You are looking very flesh[wd2,-]." The lady was angry because of the man's words. In the [np7,1-1] America "flesh" means "rule",   and the lady is [vp6,18-]an American. The lady spoke to the man angrily: "Don't get fresh [wd7,-]with me or I'll slap your face." The man didn't understand what had happened. The lady did wrong [vp1,1-]to the man. Thank you! Sorry! I am seventeen years old. I must say "thank you" to my English teacher -- Miss Lin. Because she said "Happy Birthday" to me after my birthday. [sn2,s]Though I did not eaten [vp6,5-4]  cake on my birthday. My teacher said to me "Happy Birthday". What my teacher had said to me made me very happy. So I must say "thank you" to her. By the way, I must say "Sorry!" to her too. Last Monday I said a few words in class in order to encourage my class-mates to study hard. I encourged [fm1,-]them to get the good marks in the middle [cc4,-]exam. But I have never thought[vp6,17-]about the feeling of my English teacher. I felt very sorry. But I believe: you (my teacher) are so kind that you may allow me to say "Sorry" to you.Thank you very much! Sorry! We are good friends, aren't we? How vexing! I am seventeen years old. I thought many people elt [fm1,-]  exed [fm1,-]  at this age. But I thought I brought vexation on myself. I loved  a girl in our school before the middle-term exam. [sn9,-]  And she know [vp3,1-]. I thought she loved me too. But I thought we were studying. If we were lovers, our mark [np6,1-3]  would get down, and we would not have brilliant prospects.   I thought it over. [sn9,-]  And I decided we must not love. [sn8,s] She gave me two pens on my birthday. I also gave her a pen (I like this pen very much, I have used it for one year) yesterday, and said to her "We must try our best in studying."

[sn8,s]If we usually do some body-building, we should have much more power. Today we did some building [wd3,-] more than an hour, and we felt tired. Then we had a bath there. At six o'clock.

But proffessor [fm1,-] [fm3,-]   Hunter had given them some other papers which were not important. He decided to take the papers to London by himself. 
My Hobby
Everyone has his own hobby. Some people like playing chess and some like drawing, gardening, dancing, singing? My hobby is listening to music (popular song [np6,7-]. The popular songs which I like are comfortable[wd3,-].  I have many idols, Jeff (Zhang xin jie), Beyond , LEON, JACKY, LEXT and so on are my idols.

 The frist [fm1,-]  match of the Art Fastival [fm1,-] 
 Today, we went to school early, bacause [fm1,-]  the frist [fm1,-]  match of the Art Fastival [fm1,-]  would be held.I have taken part in two items. One was a fashionable show, the other was a [np7,-1]  essay. The fashionable show would be bigun [fm1,-]   [vp1,5-2]  very soon. In the fashionable show I was very anxious because the time past [wd2,3-2]  very fast. When I should go out I hadn't change the cloth. [sn8,s] At last I took it easy as I went out. [sn1,s-s] thought the show would be held in the match [cc1,-]of the Art Fastival [fm1,-]. The essay was good. I thought the essay was the most insteresting [fm1,-]and the most instrutive [fm1,-]one in the all[wd1,1-] essay [np6,7-]. I didn't mind the result because I had try [vp6,8-2]my best. After this morning, I was very tired, I wanted to sleep at that time. [sn1,s] Our School Our school is a middle school. In the middle of the school stands a teaching building with more than thirty classrooms. 
  In the south of the school is a "big" sports field. near [fm3,-] the sports field, there are some laboratory building [np6,4-]  where we do physics, chemistry and biology experiments. In the teaching building there is also a computer room. Under [pp1,-s]the teaching building there is a big library, which has many books.[sn8,s]  Our [pr4,-6]  students work hard at our study. Every day we have six or seven classes. But we were [vp6,10-3]  still very happy in school. 
Grow [vp4,-1]  Up[fm3,-] As [fm3,-]time went on, I was growing up in [pp1, -3]  the different difficulties. After I came in this world, I began to face the difficulties. But when I was a little boy, I faced all the difficulties with my parents. So I never felt unhappy. As the years went on, many things made me much riper [wd7,5-]. I thought I would e [fm1,-]  grown [vp6, -2]  to manhood n [fm1,-]  the coming years. I was disappointed in a love affair in this term. In thses [fm1,-] day, I was often out of sorts. 
 So my marks was [vp3,2-2]  very bad in the [wd5,1-2]  seveal [fm1,-]  tests. But all these was assed [fm1,-] , and the exam is coming. I must try my best in it. After this thing, I felt I also grow up a lot. I will never cry, and be unhappy for this thing. Miss Lin, I think you has [vp3,1-2]  grown up. We will never give up when we face the difficulties. We will never  cry, we must keep on doing the thing what we want to do. [sn1,s] [sn8,s-]  Could you promise me that you will remember this word forever. Remember: Your [pr4,-5] are a rather good head-teacher! Don't give up forever! My Winter Holiday This winter holiday was very short. There are thirteen days. [sn9,-]  And there are a lot of homework in the winter holiday. However, I didn't often go out and play with my classmate [fm1,-] , my families, my friends. As the weather turns colder and colder, I have a deel [fm1,-] [pr6,3-1]  sleep every day. [sn9,-]  And I wakes [vp3,1-4]  up very late everyday. When I had finished my homework, I also went to the Flower Show with my families. [sn9,-]  Because the Flower Show was very [wd4,5-2]  y [fm1,-]  home, I went to the Flower Show a few times in the several years ago.[sn8,s]  But in this winter holiday, there are a lot of homework, I went to the Flower Show few [pr6,6-1]  time [np6, 7-]  in  [wd5,8-2]  this year. [sn1,s]This winter holiday was less happy than the [wd5,7-2]  last year, But in order to improve my marks, I would try my Best. Never regret! 
 The Spring Festival
 The spring [fm3,-] festival [fm3,-]is a tradition [wd2,5-1]  holiday of China. Everybody in China was very happy. Before the festival, people made their houses clean and beautiful. They did shopping. Shops and streets were all busy. On the Eve, every family had a big dinner. Then thousands of people went to the Flower Show, which is held once a year. They returned home with lots of fruitful [wd3,-2] orange trees as well as flowers. They kept awake excitedly [fm1,-] to welcome in [wd4,3-2]  New Year. I remembered that as a child I was, [sn8,s-] I set off fire-crackers when he clock struck 12 in my hometown. [sn1,s]But now I can't, because people are forbidden to set off fire-crackers in the big city. during [fm3,-]the festival, people in new clothes visited their relatives and friends. They gave each other New Year greetings. grown-ups [fm3,-]gave money to children s [fm1,-]  presents. Of cause wd3,1-] , I was given a lot of money. 
 My Hometown 
My hometown is situated on a large river. We have built two bridges across the river. Transportation is quite convenient. Besides the river, we have good highways. [sn9,-]and a railway is under construction. Industry is developing. Food industry is the most important. Our factories also produce toys, clothes, electronic watches and many other things. When the railway is completed, more factories will be set up. In [wd5,-2] this year, I went back to my hometown with my families. We are very happy. 
Goldfish-raising 
Many people like to keep goldfish. Yet some of them do not know well how to take care of these pets. Quite often, the fish soon die. Goldfish should be kept away from direct sunlight and the TV set. The tank should be large enough to hold plenty of water to let the fish swim about. Feed may be given once or twice a day. The amount must be small. Most goldfish die of over-eating than of hunger. The feed should be fresh and clean, or it may poison the fish. Proper care will keep the goldfish healthy and lively. 
Be [wd5,-5]  On Duty 
For the Week[sn9,-] It was our students' turns [np6,4-4]  to be on duty for the first week in the term. The weather is rather cold, but we still come to school to clean our school on time every morning. On the first day, we got up very early. For we got used to geting[fm1,-] up very late in the winter holiday, [sn7,s-s]  and it was very cold n [fm1,-]  the first day, it was difficult to get up so early on the first day. We passed every day of this week like this. On these days, we tried our best to clean the school. Because of that, we were praised by the leading cadres of the school. So we were still happy. 
Study English
It has been five years since I began to learn English. It was a different matter in the beginning. The reason why I've made such rapid progress in English is that my teacher led me along the correct way of learning it, I'm much oblige [vp7,2-2]  to him for his help. [sn1,s]When I was [wd4,3-4]  junior middle school student, our teacher wanted us to do much practice in speaking, reading and writing so as to learn English well. However, I paid little attention to what my teacher said. I was always unable to speak, read and write well. So I was one failure after another in English. Now I am regreting [vp6,3-2]  very much. From now on, I will do much practice everyday. I believe that only by working hard can you achieve great victories. 
  How terrible flies are! I sometimes have loose bowels in these days [fm1,-]. I asked my mother the reason why I suffered from abdominal pain. And I thought what I had eaten in these days. It took me a while to remember that my meal was touched by the flies in the mall [cc1,-]restaurant on the day before yesterday. Flies are very harmful. Everybody hates flies, but it is very difficult to ger [fm1,-]rid of them. especially [fm3,-] , they gets birth [cc3,1-]  very quickly in Spring. [sn8,s] A fly becomes dozens in a short time. They fly away before you can kill them. And soon they come to bother you again.  When we eat the food which was touched, we may get ill. How terrible flies are!  We must take care of them.

After Apirl fool's [fm3,-]day [fm3,-] [sn9,-]We had planed [fm2,-] to run in [wd5,-2]  this morning. But it rained last night till this  morning. [sn2,s]In [wd5,-2] this morning, I thought we needn't run any more. So I got up slowly. When I reached school, my classmate was waiting [vp1,3-2]the news whether we must run or not. In [wd5,-4]a short time ago. [sn9,-]I asked my classmate to go to our classroom. But we reached the classroom a few minutes ago, the teacher ordered we still ran with rain gears. [sn8,s] Then we started to run. But we ran no more than several hundred metres, the teacher ordered us to stop runing [fm2,-] and go back to school.[sn8,s]  I was very angry. I thought Apirl fool's [fm3,-]  day [fm3,-] had passed. 
 Television 
Television is a great invention for the people. It can take [cc3,s]the world into our homes in sight and sound. It can offer us a great deal of imformations [fm1,-] [np5,4-], and add to our store of knowledge. There are many sports meets and matches on TV, such as "NBA Basketball Match". Some matches are live telecasts. On the other hand, many goods were sold on TV. We can shopping [vp4,2-2]  t [fm1,-]  home. In these years, the number of TV sets in the countrysides[fm1,-] [np6,2-]is also increasing day by day.

It gives the creatures a living condition. The atmosphere is made up of N2, O2, CO2, H2O, and other rare gas [np6,13-]. The O2 and N2 is about 99us to breathe [wd7,s-] and for the agriculture, but also for the industry. That is to say, the air is important for us to live and develop[vp1,-].   
  The BATTERY 
Have you seen batteries? I think you have seen them.  It gives us much help in our living [wd3,7-]. We often look the battery like a short column. [sn8,s]  The top of it is "
". The and [fm1,-]  of it is "-".In it there is chemical medicine [wd3,5-]. The electric [wd2, 1-5]  comes from the chemical medicine [wd3,6-]. It is important in our living [wd3,5-]. Many electrics [wd3,1-3] need the battery. For example, the walkman, radio, flashlight, bell, clock, etc. When the electric [wd2,2-3]  becomes very weak.[sn9,-] That mean [vp3,1-5]  the battery is no use. You must change it , [sn9,-]  some can be charge [vp4,3-3]  and use [vp4,4-1]  again. This kind of battery must be charge [vp4,6-4]  by a battery charger, for a long time.

The Presents 
Long long [wd6,-] ago, there was a farmer, he had a very beautiful daughter, named Jane. [sn1,s]His neighbour Mike was struck by her beauty. He wanted to marry Jane. But Mike was foolish, and Jane didn't like him. So the farmer didn't want Jane to be married to Mike. One day, Mike went to the farmer's house and said: "I love Jane, I will take good care of her for ever." [sn1,s] Then , the farmer said if he could bring him two presents then he would let Mike marry Jane. The two persents:[fm1,-]wind held on papeer [fm1,-] , fire wrapped in paper. Mike though [fm1,-] hard. Yet he had no ideas what the things were. So he asked his clever brother. Knowing the answers, Mike went to the farmer's home with a fan and a lanterrn[fm1,-]. He said: "The fan give [vp3,2-2]  you wind and the lanten[fm1,-] is a fire wrapper in paper." The farmer was pleased. But later he found it was Mike's brother's idea. So the famer [fm1,-]  had his daughter marry Mike's brother. The Coming Exam The middle team [fm1,-]exam is coming. It doesn't leave much time. [sn8,s] The time is limited.

 Travelling [wd4,1-3]  

The XiQiao Hill [wd4,-7]Saturday, we went to the XiQiao Hill and traveled it. [sn8,s]We set off at about eight o'clock. We went there by bus. On the bus we were all happy.  every [fm3,-]  one sang a song even Miss Lin, our English teacher. She sang a song named "Yesterday Once More". It is a very good song and I like it very much. At about half past ten we reached there. Ah! The hill is so high and we all surprised [vp7,2-3]  at every thing we haven't seen. We saw the Tiao Lake. The water of the lake is green. Above the lake I saw some people passing by the lake on the wire that long and high from the lake.[sn8,s] It's wonderful! Later we travelled [wd4,3-2]  many places and we like the trip very much. 
 The Professor And His Invention Professor Hunter was very cited that morning because he had just finished the papers of his invention. And he was going to give his invention to the govenment[fm1,-]. But he wasn't strong enough to go to London himself and the men from the govenment [fm1,-]  should take his papers to London. The men coming from London would be here At [fm3,-]  eleven. Professor Hunter read through his papers again before the men came here. Then the wrong men came to professor's office and asked Professor Hunter [wd4,3-5]  what they wanted to get . Professor Hunter then gave the papers behind some books to the wrong men. And the two men said they would take good care of the papers. It's [vp6,-9]  about eleven o'clock. Miss Green ran into the room and asked if the two men had left. Professor Hunter said he had gave [vp5, 5-2]  the papers to them. Miss Green began to cry after she told Hunter all about those two wrong men. But [wd4,-3]  Professor [fm3,-]  was calm. He said the papers he had given to the men ere [fm1,-]the wrong papers. The right papers still on his desk. [sn8,s-]  Professor was always forgetting things. But he wasn't very careless in important things. 
 The Game of Table Tennis 
We all know that table tennis is a very [fm1,-] good game. Many young people [fm1,-]  like it very much. It can give us a good body.[sn9,-]because when we play table tennis our eyes see he ball coming, judge its speed and direction, and pass this information on to the brain. The brain then orders all parts of our body to move. So that the ball is met and hit back where the layer [wd3,9-4]  wants it to go. [sn2,s]  Before long, we had the game of table tennis. [sn8,s]And twenty four students of our class took part in the game. They all like table tennis and have a high level. Some days later, Four [fm3,-]  people won the other people. [sn8,s]  Later, these four people will have a wonderful game to end this game. 
 My Number [cc1,-1] Clock
I have a small [cc1,-1]clock. It's black and thin. I kept it because it gives me many uses[wd3,-]. This black clock is [wd4,-]from my father. Once, my father had a meeting with another company's generations [wd3,8-].So after the meeting he was given this black clock by the generations [wd3,8-4] to commemorate the meeting. Then my father gave the clock to me. The clock has many functions. Fox [fm1,-]example, It [fm3,-]  can be use [vp4, 3-3]as a clock. read [fm3,-]the time from it whenever you need. It is also a [np7,-2]alarm clock. It can wake you up whenever.[sn8,s]  And it has a very useful function that it can display the days, months, from AC 1900 to 2099. It also has a special function. It can compute [wd3,-2]  the tempareture[fm1,-]. When the weather turns cold or warm. [sn9,-] The number of the tempareture [fm1,-]will change on the screen immediately. I'm sure it's a nice clock. 
The Artical [cc4,-1] Festival 
The finals of the Artical [cc4,-1] Festival of Mo. 4 middle school was held on in [wd5,1-2] December twenty-eighth. There were many items in this festival such as singing, dancing and XiangSheng. The fashionable dress showing [np2,4-]  was also a very good item. In the past, The Festival had no this item, or it was dull. [sn8,s]  But this time it was more wonderful [wd3,3-2]than before. [sn9,-]Because it is from class 1, senior 2, and we are always the best. For some reasons, our item was the No. 1, but we trust we can do it better in the next time. What Heat [fm3,-]can we Stand[fm3,-][sn9,-] We sweat when we feel hot. Evaporating [wd3,-]carries away our body heat. This helps to keep our body temperature normal at 37 degrees. High temperature is not the only factor that we feel hot. Heatness [wd2,-]in the air is another factor. Before a thunderstorm, we feel extremely hot though our body temperature is not too high. To find out in what heat we can live, two Brition [fm1,-]scientists went into an oven for baking bread. Their assistants raised the temperature inside. ---finally to 60 degrees, much more than enough to boil their blood. But the scientists [fm1,-]  were all right. [sn9,-]  Because sweating kept their body temperature quite normal. 
My Winter Holiday 
winter[fm3,-] holiday begins on February the first and ends on February 24. But the holiday is too short. In fact it is more than ten days. I think there are two things can modify this holiday.[sn8,s]One is happy, but the other is not so happy. [sn6,s]  The happy one is that the spring festival is on Feburary 7th and we can have a good time. We can rest more than before, eat more food we like and do what we want. But the unhappy thing is we have so many [pr6,1-3]  homework to do. every [fm3,-]  day I have to do some homework. However, if you set up [wd3,2-3]  the time well, you will have a good winter holiday. 
 The Spring Festival[sn9,-]

 People [cc1,-]  Compurer [fm1,-] 
 As we all know, people [cc1,-]computer has become a part of our life. Because it has many uses, people like to use it usually. It can settle many problems [cc3,3-]  about maths, physics, etc. It's [wd3,-8]  computing speed is more fast [aj3,5-3]than a man. [sn8,s]  The main use of PC in family is education. You can buy a software about education from the "computer city". and go back home to install your new software, then setup [wd2,1-4]and start your software, so you will get more harvest and fun from it. Another use of PC is playing the PC game [np6,8-]. The PC game is so popular because the PC is widespread and the game made so well. [vp7,2-]  As we all know. PC supports the Sound Blaster care [wd3,5-].The music or "SFX" of the games can be played in [pp1,4-2]  the PC. It also bring [vp3,2-4]  more fun to us . 
 The Earth
The earth is a member of the universre[fm1,-]. It is much smaller than the universe. But it is important for our [wd5,4-3] human [wd4,5-2]  to live. Bcause [fm1,-]  the earth's gravity keeps the air and the water. There is 71[wd4,-] water and 29[wd4,-]The[fm3,-]earth is our beautiful family. We can't live without it or its environment becomes bad.[sn8,s]Pollute [wd2,-5]is changing the earth's environment. It breaks the balance of nature and kills many creatures. Human lives in [wd3,2-2] the earth. But our living in the earth can not makes [vp3,2-] no pollute. [sn8, s-]This is a pair of contradiction. So we much [wd7,2-3]  realize the contradiction and try to settle the contradiction [cc3,3-] , or we must be punished by the [np7,-1]nature and the earth. 
 Missing [wd3,-]Comrade DengXiao Ping[sn9,-]  
February 29th. 1997, our dear Comrade Deng Xiao Ping was separate [wd2,-]from us.   Though he had passed away, but his spirit still lives among us.

 Last week Chen Zhi Hui, our classmate was in hospital. For some reasons there is a Tamour [fm1,-]on his neck. So he must be in hospital to examine his body. [sn9,-] and he must stay there for a long time. When we heard this news. [sn2,s]We were all unhappy, we know that he can't go to school until he is healthy. [sn1,s] So his study must be delaied [fm2,-]. We must pay attention to our health, or it can bring us many troubles. the [fm3,-]  first one is that it can do harm to our body, the second one is that we can't go to school to study our new lesson. [sn1,s] When we are ill, we must have some medicine or go to the hospital to have a [np7,-1]  exam. This can make us do every thing better.  
Buying [wd4,1-1]Computer
 Sunday my [fm3,-]friend and I went to Jing Mao Computer City to buy a computer. He was so happy that he told me a lot of about the computer. We went there by taxi. Before long we reached there and went to the second floor. He had placed an order at a small computer shop of the second floor. At first, we went to other shop [np6,4-6]  to buy the memory of computer, the [wd5,-4]16M RAM costs 690, at first we had bought, but at last this RAM didn't fit for his computer.[sn8,s][sn1,s]  So we had to change the RAM. Finally, we bought two pieces of 8M RAM, They added up to 16M. Then a worker of the shop's boss helped us to install the computer.   The main device of his computer is Petiumn [fm1,-]120 CPU,2. 1 GB hard disk, 4 speed CD-ROM and trident 9680 display card. That's a very good people [wd7,-1]  computer and it will help my friend to do much [pr6,-1]  things. 
Television 
Television has become part of our life. In our spare time, we may sit in front of the screen for hours on end. Most viewers [fm1,-]  enjoy mainly sports and continal [fm1,-]  teleplay. The children njoy [fm1,-]  moving picture teleplaies [fm2,-]  mainly. They take it for granted that television is for entertainment. I remember that about ten years ago when we just had a monochrome television, we all like it very much and felt very proud because the other neighbour [np6,2-7]  didn't hae [fm1,-]  such a thing, for they took it for granted that buying [fm1,-]  a television was a difficult thing because it is too expensive for them to buy at that time. After supper or dinner, they often came to my house to watch TV, our house became a small cinema. [sn1,s] Today, people's living conditions have improved, Not only  the monochrome TV come to their family but also the colour TV. They [fm1,-]  an [fm1,-]  watch TV programs at their [wd5,1-1]  home now. 
 The Medical Examination 
Last Saturday we went to the Liu Hua Middle School to have a medical examination. We have it every year and there is no change in this year. About a quarter past one P.M. that day. [sn9,-]  I had arrived [vp6,11-]  there with He Geng Jian by bike. We also saw many classmates had arrived, but the gate of the school didn't open yet, so we had to wait for a while.[sn8,s]  After a while, the gate was opened and we began our medical examination. At first, we went through a bus to have our lungs examined. Then I went to the forth [fm1,-]  floor to have my blood examined. Oh! There were so many people that I had to follow the line. Before long, the nurse pricked my fourth finger of my left hand with a pricker [wd3,12-]  and the [wd5,14-4]  blood began to stream, then she sucked my blood with a glass sucker and gave me a cotton to keep back my blood. That's all. After the examination of my bloor [fm1,-] , I also had all parts of my body examined I was satified [fm1,-]  with the result. I am taller and more heavy [aj3,5-3]  than last year. but the eyesight is worse than last year. I think I can improve my eyesight afrertime [fm1,-]. How necessary it is!!! What A Good Sleep As we all know, it's impossible for us to work all day and all night without a [wd5,7-1]  sleep. Sleep is an important part of our life. People often sleep after supper and at night. But the second one is necessary. We must sleep for 8 hours or higher [wd3,7-] , or in the next day you will feel a discomfort. It is about 1/3 time of our life in sleep.[sn8,s]  So we must pay attention to it. Last Sunday, after supper, I felt so tired, for I have habituated myself to sleep. Isn't it a "creature [wd3,3-1]  clock".  id [fm1,-]  in bed and soon I was asleep.[sn8,s]  Then I knew nothing, what a good sleep! About 4:00 P.M. I was woken up by a [wd5,5-1]  rain. How long I sleep and I was in kilter. [sn8,s]If it didn't rain at that time, I think I could feel asleep till the next day.[sn8,s-]  
A Wonderful Pc Game. 
 I like playing the Pc game, [sn9,-]  Because it's game is so wonderful that I could never forget it.[sn8,s]  Last Saturday afternoon. [sn9,-]I went to my old friend's home to [wd4,-]chin music. When I got there, I saw he [pr4,2-4]playing a PC game named SCREAMER. In the game we can drive the car you [pr1,5-2]  have selected very fast, your goals [np6,1-4]  is to drive faster than any other cars in the game. [sn1,s]So you must have a [np7,-2]  expect[cc1,-1] skill. Now, let's go! I drived [fm2,-] a [np7,-2]  Automaic [fm3,-]car and try [vp6,6-3]  to get ahead of the other night [wd7,2-1]  cars, but the cars were o [fm1,-]  fast for me to get ahead of, for they were controled [fm2,-]  my the computer and made less mistakes.[sn8,s]  "Go! Go! Go! Here is one more to go!" said the speakers. I try [vp6,4-5]  to add [wd3,3-3]  the speed up and get ahead f [fm2,-]  others. Ten seconds later I saw the end is [vp6,4-4]  in front of e [fm1,-].Go! At last I got NO. 7. Not too bad I thought. 
 Beijing 
Beijing, the capital of China, is a very beautiful and important city. She is one of the ancient cities in China and she has a long history. Of course many Chinese people have visited Beijing. So we have known there are many famous wonders and beautiful pots [wd3,7-5] , such as the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace, Beihai Park and so on. I have been to Beijing.[sn9,-] so I have been to the Great Wall.[sn6,s]When I was at the top the watch tower of the Great Wall, I saw the Great Wall ride its way over the mountians [fm1,-]like a huge dragon. He who doesn't reach the Great Wall is not a true man. Now, I think I am a true man! Beijing is also the centre of politics, economy and culture of our country. Owning to the open-door policy, great changes have taken place since 1978. Many new houses and buliding [fm1,-][np6,4-]  can be seen everywhere. People's living condition is also getting better and better. I love Beijing. 
 Looking Up the Words In PC 
Every week, we must write a [np7,-1] artical [fm1,-]in English. But when I was writing a [np7,-1] artical [fm1,-] , there was [vp3,1-3]  a few words that I didn't know how to translate. So I had to look up these words in a Chinese-English dictionary. But sometimes I couldn't find the word I wanted to know in this kind of dictionary because the dictionary didn't correct all the words. Though I couldn't find the word I needed in this kind of dictionary, I could look it up in the dictionary of PC. The dictionary in PC has two main funtions [fm1,-]-- English into Chinese and Chinese into English. When you forget the spelling of the word, you can turn on your computer and input your words, and then you will see a result [wd3,14-3]  on the screen immediately. It's faster than looking up words in a common dictionary. I like the dictionary in PC. It helps me to write a [np7,-2]  English artical [fm1,-]  in a short while. 
 The New Playground [wd3,-2]  Of Basketball 
Last week the new playground [wd3,-2]  of basketball in our school was built up. This can give us more place to play basketball. Wednesday afternoon, some of us played basketball on the new playground [wd3,8-] , so did I. The new playground gave me a new looking [wd3,7-] : the basket with a red and white net was so high, the floor wasn't made of sand. [sn1,s] It was made of cement. It was so hard I felt. At first I didn't get use to [vp2,3-2]  playing basketball on the new playground [wd3,5-]  because the basket was too high for me to throw well. [sn9,-]  and the floor was cover [vp7,3-2]  with water. I felt so smooth but I though [fm1,-] I would get use to [vp2,3-2]  playing basketball on it.

Window [np6,-]95 is a new disk operation system for PC. It is produce [vp7,2-2]  by Microsoft in 1995. So it named [vp7,1-2]  Window [np6,-]95. Window [np6,-]95 was many strong funtions[fm1,-].[sn8,s]  We can manage our computer through Window [np6,-] 95 freely and easily. Some people don't know how to operate their computer under the DOS. But you don't worry about such things will hapend [fm1,-]  when you using the Window 95. [sn8,s-]  When you start Window[np6,-] 95, you may see some icons, under the icons are the comments of them. [sn1,s]If you want to listen [vp1,-2]  a [np7,-1]  music, put the CD into the CD-ROM then move the mouse, when the arrow points to the icon of the CD player, click the left key of the mouse, the CD player will soon start successfully.

 Two Manners. A group of young men were playing chess at the street corner. A blind man came towards them with a strick [fm1,-]  in his hand. Suddenly he touched one of the young men of [wd3,6-2]  the foot. So he said, " I'm so sorry.' [sn9,-]  The young man who was touched on the foot stood up and shouted at the blind man with anger. Just then, a young girl came up. She took the blind man by the arm and led him across the street. All the young men stood up and looked at the girl dumbfounded [wd2,4-].
 The value of time. As the saying goes, " time is money." But in my opinion time is more precious than money., [sn9,-]  " A cun[fm2,-] time is a cun [fm2,-]gold[sn8,s-], but gold can't buy time." When money is spent, we can earn it back, [sn9,-] however [fm3,-] , when time is [vp7,1-1]  passed, it can't be back. So we must value time. Time is limited, we must make full use of our time and never lose our time by trifling.[sn8,s] [sn1,s]Students as we are, we lost no relax [wd7,3-2]  our efforts to engage in our studies so as to serve our country in the future.

MY FIRST PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHER 
My first Primary School teacher is an old tall man. He was [vp6,6-4]  very strict with us, and his knowledge is so rich that he often tell us many storied  [fm1,-] about natural science, and he often toll  [fm1,-] us many stories about natural science, and some [np9,0-3] his interesting records. It wides [wd2,-]our horizon. We all respect him. Cars of today are increase [vp2,4-0]  very quickly. Roads always full [wd2,2-2]  of cars such as [pr1,8-2]  Thailand's Bangkok. Old Guangzhou is [vp2,2-2]  like that too. Now the main Roads of new Guangzhou is enough [ad2,1-1]  wide for the cars to run fast. It [pr2,0-4]  must thank the government for its working. 
 STATVE [fm1,-]OF LIBERTY
One of the most famous monuments in the world is the Statue of Liberty. It was [vp2,6-2]  the present that the people of France sent to America in the nineteenth century. It was [vp2,24-3]  made of copper and it was [vp2,32-3]  150 feet tall. Since it was set up, it became [vp2,6-2]  a symbol of liberty for the people of America. 
 Today Is Too Bad [sn9,-]Today morning [np1,1-0] , when  it was blur, I went to visit a friend. When we were talking [sn2, s]. I found it [pr2,2-3]  had turned black. Oh, no, I have [vp2,15-2]  no umbrella. It rained after a while, I still stayed in my friend's room. I thought it will [vp2,2-4]  stop in two hours. At that time, it was 9:20. But it lasted to [vp1,2-2]  rained hard, and when I left, I had to borrow a [np7,0-1]  umbrella and shippers, because the street was flooded. What a day! 
 BIRDCAGE
 Almost all aportment  [fm1,-] house [np1,3-0]   [fm1, -] I GuangZhou have the met [np6,13-0]  that is [np6,6-2]  used to prevent the thief [np6,24-0]  stealing. The net painted into black or red s made [vp7,8-2]  of iron. This makes the house looks [vp4,3-1]  like a cage and the people in it as if [wd3,1-] birds in the cage. This mirror's [np4,1-3]  the public order today is so bad and makes the city lifeless. The visitors who come from foreign country [np6,5-0]  is [np6, 8-3]  surprised at it. 
 The Development Of Computer 
The computer develops so quick [sn8,1-1] , that even every other month, a new type of CPU will be push to the market. This is a good matter [cc1,4-0]  to [pp1,7-2]  the develop  [fm2,-] of the world's science ad  [fm1,-] to  [pp1,19-2]  the player of computer.  [fm2,-] Now the factory of CPU had [sn8,5-1]  three: Intel, Cyrix and AMD. Intel is the biggest maker of CPU. Cyrix or [sn6,19-5]  AMD are the promising youth. In some field,  [fm2,-] Cyrix ar  [fm1,-] AMD's technology of CPU's [np4,2-1]  produce [vp5,3-0]  even over vp1,14-3]  that of Intel. Because the competition of [wd3,-] them is very keen, the price of the CPU falls down very quickly. Even every other month, it will fall scores of dollars. But that is a good information for us, that means we can buy an advanced computer with less money. [sn1,s] 
 The Worst Holiday
There were [cc3,1-1]  holidays in this National Day. Those should [vp6,1-1]  be the universal rejoicing days. At first, I was so happy when I heard this news, because I could have a rest in those days. But, when I came to know that there were three subjects would have a test as soon as the holidays went out.[cc2,1-1]. [sn8,s]That meant I would not be able to sleep till the lunch. I felt my wish was broken. At last, in the four days, I studied as if I was in school. I was sure this was the worst holiday from the day I was born. 
Cromprehending [fm1,-][wd2,-] 
This morning, from the magazine named Young Man And Young Girl , I found a statistics that in the middle school of Guangzhou, there are 85 the morning and raising [vp6,5-2]  the barbell,  [fm1,-] and there are 42 schoolboys who have an athletic sports [cc1,2-0]  at home or in the studium  [fm1,-] I  [fm1,-] the holiday every week. [sn1,s]Reading this, I comprehended something and I felt quiet ashamed that I had had no physical training for more than one year outside the physical cuiture  [fm1,-] class. Every time when I wanted to have a physical training, I always made a pretext to avoid it. This was a bad habid,  [fm1,-] and I wanted to correct it [cc3,12-2]  from today. So, I held my barbell  [fm1,-] at once that had been [vp6,10-3]  covered with dust and raised it.... 
The Practice [cc1,-2]Chinese Teacher 
Three weeks ago, two practice Chinese teachers came to my class and began to teacher [wd2,-] . They would taught us Unit 1 and Unit 2. At first, I wondered if they could teach us good as if [sn8,s-]  the official Chinese teacher, for, being so young and shout  [fm1,-] of experience. But , after they had had some lesson for us, I changed my idea. They taught well, that was a truth. They were consicientious  [fm1,-] in their practice [wd2,1-1] work. They corrected our exercises in a careful and thoroughgoing way. This could be seen from the remarks on our excises books. They were fit for their job. They were so good. 
 Wang Fei And Her New Disc 
Wang Fei is a singer of Kong Kong. The most remarkable one of the woman  [fm2,-] singers. She just got [vp6,2-19]  the prize that [wd5,2-1]  for the best woman singer who is recommended n  [fm1,-] the area of Southeast Asia. Her songs are well-known[aj2,-1] by their free form. That is why I live  [fm1,-] her songs. However, every time, when I heard [vp6,4-8]  her songs, I always felt [vp6,1-1]  exciting. Not long ago, she published [cc3,0-3]  a new disc call[vp4,-] The Seclect[fm1,-] Happy Music of Wang Fei . it [fm3,-] have [vp3,1-]16 songs, such as Dubiousness, DI-Dar.They are so good that even [wd4,0-5]  you have heard 100 times you didn't [vp9,9-2]  feel sick. I look forward to the success of this new disc's sales volume. 
The International Location Of Motorcycle Race 
In Zhuhai[sn9,-] The international Location of motorcycle race in Zhuhai was put into use the day before yesterday. It is the first motorcycle race in hina. Although there are five motorcycle races in Asia except t [pr2,7-0] , it is the best and newest one. So Zhuhai have enough conditions to be the central  [fm2,-] of the motorcycle's athletics in Asia. The bleachers in the Race now can hold five thousand spectators. After all the engineering [cc2,2-2]  is finished, it will be able to hold 12000 spectators. I am so exciting [aj4,3-0]  and I am proud [aj2,-1] for it.  1996, 11, 23, I will never forget that day when we had a dull time. In that day, hold high-grade two of No. 4 Middle school went to visit the Xiqian Hill. At first, we arrived at the Sky Lake. It have not any special  place[sn8,s-], just like the Li Wan Lake. After walking [wd3,1-0]  round the Lake, we saw the performance of "going [wd3,0-4]  on the steel wire". his make [vp6,12-3]  us felt [vp5,4-1]  cheated. Everyone who wasn't afraid of high could do it safely. Then we walked to the ext landscape. [wd4,0-13] Last three hours, we walked and walked from place to place to take photos. Although every landscape have [vp6,11-2]  good names, but it always bring vp6,19-2]  us disappointment. A part [cc1,0-2]  of people only layed [fm2,-]cards all through the three hours. I think the most intent [wd7,2-1]  thing I did is I left my foot mark on the hill. 
For The Coming Success 
The terminal examination had concluded for two weeks. I failed in this examination. But the unfeeling [wd7,1-1]  fact would not make me downhearted. I looked for the reason that I failed and I found the most important reason was that I had few pressing [wd7,0-1]  feeling. But, now, the feeling is so string.  [fm1,-] It makes me think out al  [fm1,-] kinds of ways to improve the study ways [wd3,1-0]  and to arranged [vp5,1-0]  the study time more reasonable [wd2, 7-0]. My motto of today is "All the work today [np1,2-0]  is finished [vp6,7-2]  within today". It includes reviewing all the subject today and solving all the question [np6,2-2]  about them.I expect the success. 
Professor Hunter was very excited that morning because he had just finished the papers of his invention. He wanted to have gone [vp6,3-2]  to London to give the papers to the government. But his daughter didn't allow [wd3,3-3]  him to go, because he was not strong enough to go. Then the government sent two men to the professor's house for the papers. But on the way to Dr Hunter's house, they were seized and shut in a house by another two men. These two came to Dr Hunter's house and asked for the papers. However, they were too nervous and too anxious to go away. This was noticed by Dr Hunter, so, the professor gave the impostors some other papers. They accepted it and soon go [vp6, 5-1]  away. At last, Miss Green, Dr. Hunter's secretary, received the police's phone call about the true [wd2,4-0] , and she told Dr Hunter sadly. Then two policemen came to know about the impostor's [fm2,-] character [wd3,3-0]  and Miss Green go[vp6,s] with the policemen to help them. 
 The Coming Art Festival 
The festival of art of No. 4 Middle School is coming. It's the [np7,1-2]  great meeting which was [vp6,9-1]  held each year. Last year, our class had no programme which was showed [wd3,7-3]  on the stage. But , this year, almost everyone in the class was mobilized[wd3,-] to attend the meeting. The programmes that we were practing such as comic dialogue,  [fm2,-] fashion show, sing [vp4,0-2]  in chorus and so on. All the actores [fm1,-]were excited and they put their heart into the practise. If you wanted [vp6,2-0]  to see them impatiently [wd3,8-0] , you could [vp6,12-14]  go to the top of the No.4 Middle School from Monday to Friday, you would [vp6, 30-3]  see them there. 
 The Fashion Show Of Our Class On TV, I had seen [vp6,2-7]  the fashion hoe  [fm1,-] many times. So , when I heard that our class will [vp6,4-4]  have a fashion show in the Art Festival, I felt very interested. Miss Lin was the person in charge [wd4,1-1]  it. She selected some students from us, and rained them. The actors began their practice the week before last week. They practised almost every day and they trained [wd3,1-1]  hard. Today, on the preview, some of them dressed ball shirts, some dressed blue jeans and checked shirts [sn9,-].... What [pr5,0-3]  prestige they are! [sn8,s] 
 The Art Festival 
This morning, we attended the Art Festival of No. 4 middle school. The programmes included dancing, singing, sketch and comic dialogue. They all [ad1,-s]were wonderful. Wenjian who came from Class four Grade One sang the song "blessing". His bearing [wd3,1-2]  was smart and his singing [wd5,0-1]  voice was so good that he got the first-grade prize. The most wonderful programme was Guoxinhua's comic dialogue. His talk was full of humour and his action was lively. It made us can't help laughing. Although it [pr2,1-4]  was the lunch time, hearing his comic dialogue [sn9,-]  I felt not hungry but belly ache. In a word, the Art Festivol [fm1,-]was successful. 
If China Lost Lekai[fm2,-] In China, the films from the foreign country [np6,2-0]are sold much cheaper than on [wd3,0-3]  their native countries. Why ? In the world, there're only four countries that can produce films. They're China, America, Japan, and Germany. The film factory in China calls [vp7,3-1]  Lekai. A [np8,0-2]  Lekai [fm2,-]film is sold [vp1,3-4]  only about ten yuan, This makes the foreign films have to be sold in [wd3,0-3]  a low price. In other countries which have no film factory  [fm2,-] of their own.[sn2,s]Such as in Russia, a [np7,0-1]imported film is sold in [wd3,3-3]  about fifteen dollar. Would the ported films be sold still [ad1,2-4]  in a low price, [sn9,-] if China lost Lekai[fm2,-]? I'm afraid not. 
 The Winter Holiday 
Though we had known [vp6,1-8]  that this Winter Holiday could be very short and we would have to make up lessons in it, I had hoped the teachers would give us few homeworks [np5,1-], then, I could have a good rest to meet the new term. But all the hopes were broken. Every teacher but Mr Zeng gave us a lot of homeworks [np6,3-0]. Oh, my god, [fm3,-] there were only thirteen free days. In these days, I could have to pay some New Years [np4,2-1]  calls [wd3,4-3]  to my relatives with my parents [sn8,21-5] , have to finish the exercised  [wd2,2-0]. What a Holiday [fm3,-] ! 
 The Happy Night
 On February 6, my parents and I went to the Flower Fair which was in the Yuexiu region. Although at the night it was raining and sometimes it rained fairly hard, there were so many visitor visiting the Flower Fair. This surprised us.I thought it was because this year was the Bull Year.[sn2,s] They wanted to devoloped [wd7,0-3]  the Bull's vigour: dare not to do the tired things. Proping up [wd3,1-1]  umbrellas, we alked about the busy Flower Fair and the beautiful flowers excited. The bad weather didn't make us dissappointed [fm1,-] , instead we had a good time at that night. 
The Spring Festival
The Spring Festival is the Festival of Chinese. It includes three days. In these days, the people all over the country are in happiness. To the children, the Spring Festival means they can wear the [np7,10-2]  new clothers[fm1,-], get the "Lishe". [sn6,s]It's time for them to havest[fm1,-]. To the adult, the Spring Festival is the busy day [np6,6-0]. They will go to pay New Year calls to their relatives from this house to that house. To most people , they will play deep [wd3,1-3]  into the night, get up later [aj3,2-3]  in next morning. In a word, the Spring Festival is the day which is full of happy atmosphere. 
 The Trouble Day 
Maybe it knew that we would go to visit our old Classmaster [fm1,-] [sn8,11-5], it stopped raining at AM 9:00[wd1,1-]At 10:00.[sn2,s]All the friend  [fm2,-] had been [np1,6-3]the assembly point,[sn8,s] but one, [sn9,-]At last, we knew from the phone call that he had forgotten it. Then Eighteen people set out. After we leave [vp6,16-3]  the teacher's home at 12:30. We quarrelled  about the place where we would [vp9,6-2]  have lunch. At the fast food restaurant we would have lunch [wd1,7-0].At the fast food restaurant, we threw the ice which in the soft drink to other [pr3,10-1]  friends. When we were happy, it rained again. We had to rush to a friend's house near here. But we lost the way in the path. Oh, the trouble day, why I met it? [sn8,s] 
 The New Beginning 
The new term had [vp6,3-6]  been on Formally for two weeks. All customs that in last term [sn2,3-0]  Had [vp6,20-2] been restored. We had [vp6,26-6]  to go to school at night again. Besides this,, we had [vp6,39-4]  to go to school at night again. Besides this, we had [vp6,52-15]  to go to school to read aloud the text  [wd1,3-0]  at AM 7 :30  [wd1, 2-0] , and we had [vp6,74-12]  to write the old  [cc4,0-1]  words from   vp2,6-1]  memory everyday. Although we didn't [vp6,91-5]  want to do those things, they were [vp6,100-11]  the only way to get  [vp2,0-2]  the [np7,0-1] success in our learning. There are some good news, too. Such as the new basket-ball ground will be finished building [wd5,2-0]  soon. There are some new challenges, too, such as the coming examination in our province. We are getting ready for the new challenges. 
 Two People  Two Result At this weekend, we will have a maths test. We all were [vp6,8-8]  busy doing the maths excises day and night. This night, Guozongci asked me a question. When I saw t, I said it was easy, [sn9,-]and I had done it. Then I did t again for him. Soon, I had some trouble. I found I couldn't explain it. How I explained [sn8,2-2]  it yesterday? I thought it over. At last, I found the rror  [fm1,-] is in the printing. It caped [wd3,1-3]  the letter "I". When I told his [pr4,2-2]  this result, he opened his mouth, last [vp4,4-2]  fifteen seconds. Then, he said in a very dejected voice: "I have spent so much time on it. I had believes [vp6,1-0]  that it was a very hard question which few people could work out. But , now ...... " I thought I was lucky, because , when I work it yesterday. [sn9, -]My eyes were so tired that I believed the question had the latter "I" by mistake. Otherwise, I would work [vp6,19-3]  it [vp1,3-0]like Cuozongci. 
 The Busy Sunday

This Saturday, there came a bad news that we would had to [vp4,2-2]  write  composition. The composition was about how to protect the environment and it must be completed before next Wednesday. That meant we would have to finish it on Sunday, or we would have no time to do it next week. But, besides his, I had to do the chemical exercises which had eleven pages, [sn9,-] had to do the English exercises which has [vp6,7-2]  twelve pages, [sn9,-]had to go over the English lessons, [sn9,-]had to go over the political lessons for he coming examination on next Tuesday. Oh, the busy Sunday! I can't finish all the work. The New Basket-ball Court. Since [wd3,0-2]  this week, our new basket-ball courts [np6,12-0]  had entered the last constructional stage. They [pr1,21-0]  would [vp6,0-5]  be finished in two weeks. That's great. We could [vp6,35-0]  free ourself [fm2,-]from the provisional basket-ball courts [np6,3-0]. The old courts [np6,8-0]  were [vp6,52-1]  covered with sands. After it raided the old courts were [vp6,62-5]  always being [vp6,4-1] covered with water. When the new basket-ball courts [np6,78-0]  were [vp6,79-2]  set up, we would never feel helpless in face of a task beyond our capability. We were [vp6,1-4]  expecting the day's coming. 
Boyzone 
Boyzone is the band of Ireland. There are five members in it. They are Ronan, Stephen, Keith, Shane, and Mikey. Last year, They  [fm3,-] published the first record of their own. In this record, there were three hit singles. It was the hit single [fm2,-] Love me  [fm3,-] for a reason  [fm3,-] that made them famous. This year, they published their new record. Soon the single [fm2,-] Words [fm2,-] in it  [fm3,-] climb [vp6,12-4] up the Pop Notice. In our class, there are some people who like them very much. We are intoxicated with its melodions  [fm1,-] singing. 
 Pride Make [vp3,-]Fall 
I fell again. I made the same mistake. It is pride. In three tests which had been on in this [np9,1-2]  two weeks, I lagged behind, because of pride. It had surrounded [cc3,-1]  me for one year. After I changed [wd3,2-3] it last term, I made a progress. ut, In this [np9,1-2]  two weeks, I follow [vp6,7-4]  the same disastrous road. Of course, I fell again. Now, I must changed [vp4,1-2]  it again. I must pull my forces together and tart  [fm1,-] afresh. The Worst Luck In [wd5,0-2]  this Wednesday, I met the worst luck. From evening to evening, there were six or seven rains [cc1,-2]of sand blown into my left eye. The biggest one must be the one that was blown into my left eye on the intersection of Taibao Street I [fm1,-]the evening.  [sn8,s] As soon as it entered my left eye, I had to stop my bike. I stayed on the intersection or several minutes. But it had not any improvement. So I had to go only by the left eye. Cursing the gob,  [fm3,-] I get [vp6, -3]  to my classroom. I had a rest for fifteen minutes.After that, I washed out [wd7,1-4]  at about eight o'clock. It took me more than forty-five minutes to with it [vp2,9-0] ! 
 Hong Kong Be [vp6,-]Better,[sn9,-] Tomorrow 
Today, the Qingma Bridge in HK was [vp6,5-3]  brought to completion. It is the largest bridge in the world. Its steel ropes are so long that they can circle the earth four times in all. It has two strata [wd7,3-13] , Cars  [fm3,-] run on the upper stratum [wd3,13-0]  and trains run on the other one.In the evening, there held a large celebration for that [pr1, 9-0] , including the play of the fireworks. The grand play is so wonderful that the spectators let out the surprised shout from time to time. The last act, "Hong Kong will Be Better, Tomorrow"' gave the finishing touch. Hong Kong will be better, tomorrow. I believe this will be reality [cc2,2-0]. The Qingma Bridge's completion firms us. 
 Who Control [vp4,1-1]Whom? 
In the 1990's, the development of computer took on a very high speed. The competition between the computer company [np3,4-0]  became keener. This made the price if  [fm1,-] the computer lower and lower. And [wd5,0-3]  more and more new products appear [sn8,20-0]. In this side [wd3,2-0] man controlled the computer. But, with the renewal of the computer., the software developed so fast , that "486" had been unfitted for the software's development. This made the people who were using "486" or "386" have to change their computer into "586", or they would not use the new softwares [np5,-]well. In [wd3, 0-2]  this side, computer controlled [vp6,0-5]  man. No matter who controls whom, this relation will make the society develop even faster, and it has done [pr1,2-0]. 
 The Trouble By The Termites [fm1,-] 
The last self-study hours in the evening this Wednesday [sn8,6-0] , wrote down the awkwardest [aj3,1-1]  position [cc3,6-6]  in the history of my class. There were a lot of termites. At the night. [sn2,s] Because they always against [wd2,2-3]  to our body, we used all kinds of ways to drive off[wd3,-] or kill them. Some struck them by hand[np6,-], some by book[wd3,-], even some by rule. Even [ad1,0-4]  there was a classmate who put the termites into a bottle. The other classmates called this "the tea of chrysanthemum". At last, we thought of the best way killed [vp4, 3-1]  termites. We put two buckets [wd7,3-0]. With more and more termites were killed [vp4,6-7]  by this way, the class became quiet. 
 My New School 
My new school is a key school. It has been built [wd3,3-3]  for seventy years [sn9,8-4]  As a key school, many of the students who had graduated had [vp6,29-2]  been famous. It is big and beautiful. Around the school building, there are many trees. There are two teaching buildings [sn9,4-3] , one experimental building. And a big play-ground in it.[sn2,s] On the play-ground, the students can do all sorts of activities [cc3,4-0]  to have physical training. Now there are thirty-six classes, one thousand eight hundred students, and more than two hundred teachers in it. The teachers are excellent. They are strict with the students, and the students respect them. 
 After The Flood 
As we all knew, the great flood had [vp6,3-2]  broken out in Conghua and Huadu. This is the largest flood in Guangdong 500 years. [sn8,s]But, out of my estimation, the victims of the natural disaster didn't [vp6,23-6]  show too much lament. Their calm [wd2,1-2]  shook me very much. As soon as the water turned back, they took an active part in rebuilding their house [np6,8-0]. From them, I saw the strongwilled [wd2,3-0] ; I saw the active life. In the disaster area, there is a lot of rice field which wasn't [vp6, 12-1]  submerged by the flood. It still grows well. This is a good omen. It means they will have the [np7,5-2]  good harvest. 
 June, 14 Afternoon   Nearby 30 degree centigrade
In this afternoon, it was very hot. Outside the windows, I saw seven or eight children swimming in the river. It seemed that most of them were good at swimming. There was a little girl learning swimming, too. Her mother was teaching her. This made me think of my childhood. At that time, I often swam, too. About ten years go,  [fm1,-] when I was spending my holiday in Beijing, I swam for the last time. June is the best month of a year, I believe.

When you require [vp6,59-0] us.[sn8,s]to [fm3,-]write once a week, some student [np3,1-1] suggest [vp6,74-0]  different notion [np6,8-0]. In fact.[sn2,s]At the desk's [wd7,2-4] I think so too.[sn8,s] But Think [fm3,-] [vp5,1-5] carefully.[sn2,s]our[fm3,-] teacher is right. This is very good for us. But we didn't see.[sn9,-]at[fm3,-] once.[sn2,s]Really very Sorry[fm3,-]. [sn8,s] But I am sure teacher [np7,4-0]isn't angry. Because we are all good student [np3,2-0]. In the future.

  The five [fm2,-] week[sn9,-] 
A question of reading[sn9,-] People usually say: "If you do so, you will make progress, [sn9,-],in reading and improve[vp5,3-1]English study. For [wd3,0-11]this.[sn2,s]I ever [fm1-1]bought some English storybooks to read. First. [sn9,-]It was difficult. [sn9,-]to read.[sn8,s] Because There [fm3,-]were plenty of new words. I must look [wd4,-] up in [np7,s]dictionary one by one. so [fm3,-].[sn2,s] I could derstand.[fm1,-] But that day, I read a newspaper. an [fm3,-]Article[fm3,-]. [sn9,-]About reading English book[np3,2-0], have an other[fm2,-] notion.[sn8,s] It said don't [vp6,2-6]reads plenty of famous English story. [sn8,s]beacuse[fm3,-] There  [fm3,-] were [np3,3-2]much grammar we wouldn't [vp9,5-1]know. It will [vp6,29-0]bring some question [np3,1-0]for us. We must make the base [wd7,4-0].[sn8,s] Teacher, I wouldn't [vp9,1-6]  know it was right or wrong. I wonder if you will [vp9,4-2]tell me when you are free.

[sn9,-]no[fm3,-] one actively put up [wd4,5-1] own hand to answer teacher's question. Usually teacher [np7,0-2]  asked us the whole class kept[vp5,-] silent. Class room[np7,-]changed [wd3,2-2]very silence [wd2,5-0]. Each student all [wd7,2-1]  bowed [wd3,4-0]. It [wd4,0-4]like we were tried [wd7,2-9]  by.[sn9,-]teacher [np7,-]. [sn8,s]and  [fm3,-] [wd3,-]waited to receive a terrible order. [sn8,s]but this is wrong. It is understood by us. but  [fm3,-] why didn't we put our [vp2,1-1]  hand, why?       It is a face or a [np7,0-1]  afraid question [cc4,4-0][cc1,5-0]. [sn9,-]or really didn't [vp9,18-1]  answer? [sn8,s]This [pr1,0-4]  must ask our students. [sn8,s]I asked me own [sn8,s-].I[pr4,-1] answer is [vp6,2-2]I didn't know too. why? sometimes [fm3,-].[sn9,-] some question [np3,1-0]is [vp6,12-0] very easy to answer for [pp1,-1]us. but[fm3,-]my hand always. [sn9,-]didn't put up [sn2,2-0]. and[fm3,-] saw other classmates all didn't [vp2,6-0]  put up their hand. [sn8,s]I put up my head down [wd7,4-0]  too. It was helpful for us to answer question [np6,1-2]  in class. It [pr1,11-2]  can cure [wd3,2-2]  our mistakes. and train [sn2, 1-0].us to say to think [sn2,4-0]. This [pr1,0-5]  must be changed by us. [sn9,-]in time [sn2,1-0]. must do from owner.  [sn8,s]I hope our classmates. [sn9,-]know this question too and changed it. [sn8,s] 
 Sunday, mother brought me a moden [fm1,-]  radio. [sn9,-] for my birthday [wd4,0-2]  1.17. 'm [vp6,16-4]   [fm1,-] very happy and say [vp6,24-0]  "Thank you. my  [fm3,-] mother". This radio isn't a [np7,0-1]  ordinary radio. It is [vp6, 44-2]  the first  [wd4,3-3]  that I [vp6,52-1]saw. It's functions. [sn8,s]was most.[sn1,s]a [fm3,-]lot of functions that I ever knowed[vp6,-]. [wd4,-1]example [fm3,-] : It had a function. [sn9,-]call [vp4,6-2]  "read again" though I researched a long time. [sn8,s]at [fm3,-]last. [sn9,-]I know [vp6,23-0][pr5,1-2]it mean [vp6,31-0]. It mean [vp6,35-0]  When  [fm3,-] you listen [vp6,42-0]once. [sn8,s] .if[fm3,-] you didn't listen clear [cc5,1-].and [fm3,-]want to listen again.[sn9,-]you wouldn't [vp9,15-4]  put [wd3,0-3] on the "Rew"[fm1,-]. you [fm3,-]only put [wd3,0-3]  on "read again". radio [fm3,-][np7,0-2]  can read [wd4,1-3]  again and again. if [fm3,-]you listen [vp6,2-1]  clear [cc5,1-]. only [fm3,-]put on the "play". [sn8,s]radio [np7,0-7][fm3,-] can [vp6,47-0]read the next word. This function was very useful. [sn9,-]for me. When I studied English. It wiped [wd7,1-1]  study. English's different [wd2,1-0]. [sn9,-]for me.[sn8,s] I must use it to study well. [sn9,-].and[fm3,-]exercise [np7,-1]spoken language. [sn9,-]harder. [sn8,s]Thank you[sn9,-]mother's present.[sn2,s]

                                                  Mar 15.96
 People usually say: "It is important to read in English." If you wd4,1-1]    so, you will make progress in reading and improve English udy [fm1,-]       For [wd3,0-1]  this [sn2,3-0]. I [vp6,0-8]  ever bought some English storybooks to read, st [wd7,1-0]. It was difficult. [sn9,-]to read [sn2,1-0]. Beacuse [fm1,-]There were plenty of new words. I must look up in dictionary. [sn9,-] one [sn2,0-2]  by one. So I could understand [sn9,3-18]  But that day I read a new paper [sn9,-]an Article [fm3,-]about reading English book have another notion. [sn1,-]It said don't read plenty of famous English  story [sn9,-] [np3,6-0] beause [fm1,-] There  [fm3,-] were much grammar. me [pr4,-s]  wouldn't [vp9,0-1]  know. I ill bring [wd3,2-2]  some question [np3,1-0]  for us, we must take [wd3,12-2]the base.
                                                      Mar 24.96 
Today, let's talk about putting up your. [sn9,-]hand in the class [sn2,3-0]. This is a serious question. [sn9,-] for our class [sn2,2-0]. When we have class. [sn9,-] [sn2,3-0] no one actively put up [wd4,4-2]  own hand to answer teacher's [np7,1-0]  question [np6,3-0]. Usually [wd4,0-8]  teacher [np7,0-1]  asked us [sn8,7-5]  the whole class kept [vp4,-1]silent. Class room changed [wd3,2-2]  very silence [wd2,5-0]. Each student all [wd5,2-0]  bowed [vp3,5-0]. It like we were tried by.[sn9,-] teacher[np7,-] and waited to receive a terrible order.[sn8,s]but[fm3,-] this is rong  [fm1,-]. [sn8,s]It is understood by us. [sn9,-] but why didn't we put [vp2,0-2]  our hand. why? It is a face or a afraid [np7,1-1] question  [cc4,1-]   [cc1,5-0]. or  [fm3,-] really didn't [vp9,4-1]  answer? this s [fm1,-] tesk  [fm1,-] our students. I asked myself. I [pr4,0-1]  answer is I didn't know too [sn9,-]why? sometimes, some question [np3,1-0]  is [np9,4-0]  very easy to answer or  [fm1,-] us. [sn9,-]but my hand. [sn9,-]always didn't put up. [sn8,s] and saw other classmates, [sn9,-] all didn't [vp9,0-4]put up their hand. [sn8,s]I put my head down too. I hope our classmates know this question[wd3,-] too and changed [vp6,8-0]it.

 APR. 7. 96. Some of our classmates often waste their time. they spent too much of their time. [sn9,-]in playing games [sn2, 2-0]. watching TV and doing  [fm1,-] other things [sn2,5-0]. But they said that they didn't have enough time to [wd4,3-2]  their homework. and prepare [vp6,10-0]  their lessons [sn2,3-0].Many people know [vp6,19-0]the time is [vp6,24-0]inportant [fm1,-] , but they don't [vp6,32-0]  know how to use the time to do some useful thing [np3,2-0]. Time is pass [vp6,2-0]  very quickly. we  [fm3,-] must take care of time. [sn9,-] and remember that time is more precious than money. Let us catch [vp2,0-1]  Time  [fm3,-] together. to study [sn2,1-0].
                                                  APR 18. 96

[sn8,s]and[fm3,-] he had no medicine, [sn9,-] He was not strong enough to find any food, [sn9,-]he doesn't [vp6,15-0]  have anything to eat, so he became very thin. At night he had a good dreams[np3,2-0] [sn9,-] Slowly the illness passed. and  [fm3,-] he began to feel better. At last he was well ain [fm1,-]. One day he found a dog. So he lived with this dog every year. soon [fm3,-] after he learned how  to speak with the dog and [wd5,s-]  they often talked together[fm1,-]. So [sn2,0-9]. Crusoe didn't feel very lonely and sad any more . At last he had a small corn-field. the  [fm3,-] plants began to grow.and  [fm3,-] he had wild goats and hares.  Oh-ha [fm1,-]. he [fm3,-] became [wd4,3-5]well-off small farmer. I hope he will realize this good dreams. d  [fm1,-]  [fm3,-] wish him feels better early.

Teacher [np6,28-0] activly [fm1,-]answered the students [pr4,0-1]  question some had no question but they would standed. [sn9,-] [sn1,-] the ground. [sn9,-]and listened carefully. sometimes [fm3,-]they liked [wd3,1-1]  quarrelling. Oh. [sn9,-]  they [fm3,-] were arguing [fm3,-]  This  [fm3,-] was lone [wd7,2-0]. I hope in this surrounding. We will get a very good score [np3,6-0]. [sn9,-]
My First Teacher
 My first teacher Miss Chen a teacher for me To remember, [sn9,-][sn8,s] She taught Chinese . She prepared her lesson very well. Her lectures were clear and interesting [sn9,5-10]And she gave us a lot of exercises in class.  She carefully corrected our  work [wd3,1-0]  and gave good comments on it. Miss Chen said the most important subject at primary school was language. With her help, we worked hard and made good progress [sn9,-]  Miss Chen loved her pupils. She was kind and patient. Her advice always proved valuable. We all liked to tell her what we did and thought[sn9,-]  I will always remember Miss Chen as a good teacher. A few weeks ago in [wd3,0-4]  my visit to her, we still  talked quite a lot about my first days at school.
  A disappointed [fm3,-]Trip 
We took a one-day trip during the summer vacation. We decided to set off at eight. For some reason the bus didn't come until ten o'clock. Some of us began not to feel happy. [sn8,s]When we at last got on the bus, it was half past ten already. Half an hour later. on the way. [sn2, 2-0][sn9,-] we began to feel something wrong with the bus. Very soon the bus couldn't move. any [wd3,0-4]  of us were worried if we could [vp9,3-3]  have pleasant visit [np5, 2-0]. No longer [wd3,1-9]  we got to the destination but it began raining[sn8,s]. Many of us didn't have umbrellas. We had to stay on the bus. Some of us, and some children, [sn9,-] felt hungry. but[fm3,-]we could do nothing. We had to wait and wait. It was nearly five when it stopped raining. We had to get ready for our way back.  All of us were disappointed. On the way home A few days ago, when I was hurring [fm1,-]to go home, my bike suddenly broke down. I must get it repaired.  But it happened that I had no money. [sn9,-]either. [sn8,s]I was worried [wd4,0-3]what to do. [sn8,s]Just then a student whom I  did not know passed by. she  [fm3,-] gave me a five-yuan note and hurried away. There was no time for me to ask her her [wd6,-]name and which school she was in. For several days I waited in the street to look for her but... I couldn't say "thank you" to her.

 On the way home A few days ago, when I was hurring [fm1,-]to go home, my bike suddenly broke down. I must get it repaired. But it happened that I had no money with [wd3,4-1] me, [sn8,s]and the friends with me had no money, either. I was worried [vp1, 2-3]  what to do. Just then a student whom I did not know passed by. She gave me a five-yuan note and hurried away. There was no time for me to ask her name and which school she was in. For several days I waited in the street to look for her but... I couldn't say "Thank you" to her.

 1.My Winter Holiday
 2.The Spring Festival
 The Spring Festival
 The Chinese New Year-- the Spring Festival will come. [sn9,-] these days [sn2,1-0].  Now I say [vp6,2-3]  more about it. Before the festival, people made [vp6,12-0]  their houses clean and beautiful. They did [vp6,21-0]  shopping. Shops and streets were [vp6,28-0]  all busy. The was [vp6,34-0]  much like that during Christmas in the West.[sn8,s] On the Eve [fm3,-] , every family had [vp6, 54-0]  a big dinner. Then thousands of people went [vp6,64-0]  to the Flower Show, which is held once a year. They returned [vp6,78-0]  home with pots of fruitful orange trees as well as flowers. They kept [wd3,0-3]  [vp6,93-0]  awake excitedly to welcome in [cc3,1-2]  New Year [np7,5-0]. If [wd5,0-18]  in the past. when the clock struck 12, every family set off fire-crackers but now it didn't [vp6,2-1]  happen. During the festival, people in new clothes visited [vp6,13-0]  their relatives and friends. They gave [vp6,21-0]  each other New Year greetings. Grown-ups gave [vp6,30-0]  money to children as presents. How interesting! My Winter Holiday This winter holiday [sn2,2-0]. I arrived in my home town--Leizhou half an island[[fm2,2-]--zhan jiang[fm3,-].[wd4,-] Home town has changed a lot since my last visit three years ago. Many of the old houses are gone.  In their place [np3,3-0]  are tall modern buildings. New streets are much wider than the old ones. The city has grown. Perhaps it is twice as big as before. Zhanjiang has become a trade center.  Most shops are crowded from morning till night. They are doing good business. The people's living standard is improving. However, public traffic remains rather poor. The bues  [fm2,-] are very slow. Many people go about by bike [np3,5-0]. On the whole [sn2,2-0]. Leizhou gives [wd3, 1-8]  me an impression better than what I remember.
 Spring
 There are four seasons in a year. Spring is the first. In spring the weather begins to get warmer and warmer. The breeze blows gently. The sun shines brightly. Sometimes we have lots of rain. Plant [np5,0-1]  start to grow again. Flowers begin to blossom. Birds fly merrily here and there. Spring is a season for planting. Farmers are busy ploughing the fields and sowing seeds. They are expecting a bumber  [fm1,-] harvest. Spring is also a good season for us students to go for an outing.  Some visit the seaside. and [fm3,-]some climb mountains. Spring is considered [vp1,2-6]  the best of the four seasons.
 Sunny

 It is very hot this afternoon [sn9,-]The temperature rises to thirty centigrade. I catch sight of some children swiming [fm1,-]in the river. There maybe seven or eight ones [wd3,3-0]. Most of them are good swimmers. A little girl is learning how to swim. Look! her mother is teaching her patiently. They are having a good time. I usually swam in my childhood. About ten years ago. [fm3,-]when I spent my holiday in Beijing. I had [vp6,1-2]  gone swimming. It was my last once [wd7,4-0]. I believe the best month in the year is June.

 My Friends
 When I was a child, I had many good friends in my contry [fm1,-]side. We studied and played together. Then I was so happy. However, at the age of ten, I had to the city which is named Xinxiang. [sn8,s]I was lucky to make some new friends here [wd3,14-]. In a school of Xinxinang, I spent three years as a pupil. Those days were  [wd4,3-5] most happy of my life, because there are  [vp6,11-5] many good friends around me. Now, I hope very much that I can see them again.I still remember that  [wd3,4-7] day which [pr5,s-] I first came to school. When I came into class and sat down, my Chinese teacher introduced me to all the pupils who were in my class, then they looked at me, I was so afraid, I thought they must be laughing at me. [sn1,s] [fm3,-], they told me, "Welcome to our class, you have been [vp6,2-]a pupil of our class." After I listened [wd3,4-5] to this, I was so exciting [vp5,9-] , but I only laughed and said," Thank you! Thank you !" three [fm3,-]  years later, I left my school, I began to study in a famous Middle School in Xinxiang. I made many new friends[sn9,-] but I also missed [wd3,s-] many friends. From making friends, I really know what the lift [fm1,3-1]is. Life of people can't be good and also can't be bad all the time. If you know the meaning of life, you must know how to live and how to make friends. from [fm3,-]now on, I will try my best to make more friends, to make better friends. I hope that everybody also can make more and better friends. in [fm3,-]  that case our life will change [wd3,3-4]  more and ore happy , we also  [ad1,2-6] will change [wd3,4-4]  more and more friendly.

I think I have a lot of friends, but she is the best. after [fm3,-]  many years, now I think I lost her, but she don't [vp9,2-2]lose me.

ZHAO MIN English Study
 in [fm3,-] schools boys and girls are leaning [fm1,-] languages. Do you know how many languages there are in the world? The teacher told us there [wd4,5-2]  about 1500, she also said that English is one of the most important languages because so many people use it, not only in England and America, but in other contries [fm1,-]  of [np7, 5-1]  world, so study [vp4,1-6] English is very important for us , if we study English well, it will be very useful for us. [sn1,s] some [fm3,-] girls who study English found that it is difficult to study English. For example, hare [wd7,3-5]  some difficulty in produacing [fm1,-]  some world [wd3,6-] , make [vp4,5-5] this grammer [fm1,-] into other grammer [fm1,-] and so on. [sn8,s]because [fm3,-]  of these reason [np6,4-] , they found English is very hard to learn. The teacher told us that who find English is hard to learn as they don't find the best way to learn [np7, 4-2] foreign language [sn2,s-]. Which is the best way to learn a foreignage [fm1,-] ? We know that we all learn our own language well when we were still children. if [fm3,-] we learn a second language in the same way , it won't seem so difficult. How does a small child do? He listen [vp3,2-4] to what people say and he tries to guess what people say. When he wants something, he has to ask for it. he is using the language, thinking in it and talking in it all the time. So we learn English should be speak it as much as possible and using and thinking in it as many [wd3,7-3]  as you can. [sn8,s] If you that, I think you will learn English very, and find it easy. [sn8,s]I hope all the boys and girl [np6,s-]  will learn English well.

MARX AND FORETGH SANGUAGES
 Karl Marx was a man of great learning . he [fm3,-]  had wide knowledge in foreign languages. Marx knew several foreign languages. He needed them for his revolutionary work. He could read  [wd4,3-5] all the main European  languages, and write in French and English. He said:" A foreign languge [fm1,-] is very important in one's life." Marx was born in Cermany [fm1,-]. when [fm3,-]  he was very young , he was forced to leave his motherland because of his revolutionary reasons. he [fm3,-]  stayed in France for a time [wd3,7-] , but before long, he had to move on again. In 1849 [sn9,-] he went to London and looked upon it as the base of his revolutionary work. Marx had learned some English before he went to England. When he got there [sn9,-] he found that his English was not good enough, so he worked hard to improve it . he [fm3,-]  made rapid progress and soon he began to write articles in English for a newspaper. In fact, in one of these articles his English was so good that Engels wrote him a setter [fm1,-]  and praised him for it . when [fm3,-]  he wrote the Civil War in France, he had mastered English so well that he was able to write in it. in [fm3,-]  the 1870's, when Marx was already over 50, he began to learn Russian because he wanted to study the situation in Russian .by [fm3,-]  the end of six months he had learned enough to read articles and reports in Russian. In one of his books, Marx had this to say about has to learning a foreign language.[sn8,s]" in [fm3,-] the same way, the person who has learned a new language always translates it into his own. Only when he can use the new language without thinking of his own language , we can say that he can learn a foreign language."

Also, China was considied [fm1,-]  to be the largest market in the world. During the Qing period, scores of westerners went to China. [sn9,-]  but they were no longer kind. They looked down upon Chinese , taking up many land whick [np3,5-3]  [fm1,-]  belonged to china. they [fm3,-]  also made a plan for taking up all the world.

As a result,some of them can take only a bit of sandwishes [fm1,-]. some [fm3,-] of them can also go to the restaurant to have their lunch. The [np7,s-] supper is the most important meal in a day. dinner [fm3,-]  means on Sunday or someone's birthday or especial days that is prepared.[sn8,s]Most of the family take off their old clothes and then put on another [wd3,s-]  new clothes before the supper.

And he as going to give his invention to the government.[sn8,s] This invention of his will greatly benefit the whole world, so two government officials would come for the papers at eleven o'clock in the morning. But two thieves shut the right men in an empty house and took away their cards. And two impostors got to the [wd5,1-3]  professor [fm3,-]  Hunter's house at half past ten. As they looked too nervous and were too anxious to leave, the professor didn't trust them. He only gave them some other papers, and they left in a hurry. Shortly after that, two police officers came to his house. They said that the two men were impostors, and they must try hard to catch them. But he professor said it was not necessary.

 December 21. Who attended the acting in our class spent some time in practising. Though we didn't try our best to practise, we practised very seriously. We didn't leave school, [sn9,-]until it turned dark. But the other classes, they spent every night to practise [sn5,s]. I think that it isn't well  [wd2,5-0]. If they waste much time to practise. [sn2,6-0]  It must affect their studying. In [wd5,0-2]  this time our main duty is [wd4,5-1]  study. The end of term is coming, we shouldn't waste time to do the others things.    The weather turned colder and colder. Some students must [vp9,-1]Wear clothes. I hope they don't have a cold. Because that will have effect in their studying [sn2,7-0]. Finally I wish we can enter the finals.
 December 29. On Saturday morning who attended the acting in our class went to the theatre at 8:45. [sn8,s]  We went there early in order that we have [vp6,8-5]  enough time to make up.

January 5. The final exam is coming. we [fm3,-]have nine days to go over. I will try my best to pass it. But my English base [cc4, -2]  isn't good. I forgot the words very easy [wd2,5-0] , and I didn't remember again in time. So I was afraid to make sentences. My English [cc4,1-3]  feeling isn't good. Perhaps I didn't read enough. Perhaps I didn't do my best to study English. Though that, I will go over it carefully. My chinese [fm3,-]  base   [cc4,2-2]  isn't good. I must go over it carefully, too. Only nine days  [sn2,2-0] ! The time isn't enough. I didn't want to write so much. I'd better go over now.
 My winter holiday
 The date was February 1. It was Saturday, my first holiday in winter. [sn1,s] When I was doing my chinese  [fm3,-]  homework, my father was cleaning the kitchen . My father had to clean alone because my mother had to go to work that day. Though I was very busy, I regretted I had never given him a hand. Though that, I had never made him disappointed.[sn7,s] I became a cook and cooked some food to eat together. He was very happy. I promised if I had spare time. I would do some housework.
 This winter holiday seemed that we had some time to rest. [sn8,s]But in fact wasn't like that. [sn8,s]  We had plenty of homework. We must finish it quickly. We must prepare [cc3,2-3]  the new knowledge and go [cc3,1-4]  over the old knowledge in this winter holiday. We had only thirteen days to do it so that I had almost finished the homework before February 1.Except maths and physics, I must [vp9,1-9]  wasted a long time to work out every question. I think I will [vp9,3-2]  very light-hearted in February 7. I will receive some money. I will have spare time to rest. Finally I wish everybody happy Spring Festival.
 The Spring Festival
 February 6 was the day before the Spring festival. I had prepared some sweets and some cookie [np6,1-0] to past [wd2,9-3]  the Spring Festival. In the evening the supper was very plentiful. I ate enough. After supper my family went to the flower market. There were a lot of flowers.  Plenty of people looked like a sea.[sn8,s] All kinds of flowers made the road very beautiful. There were some market [np6,1-6]  on each side of the road. We could go for some food or buy something. The date was February 7.It was the first day of the Spring Festival. I congratulated my parents on everything as soon as I woke up. My parents gave me two "red bags". There was some money in the "red bags". They wished me grow faster and study well. [sn8,s]After breakfast we went to give [cc3,1-3] the relative congratulations. At that time I could receive some "red bags". I almost did the same work in several days. I felt very light-hearted. Though that, I must go [cc3,2-3]  over the knowledge. I shouldn't do nothing in several days. Break Away The Habit February 1 was the first day of the winter holiday. I almost finished my homework. That day was Saturday. I used to watch TV or listen [vp2,1-1]  music. But I knew I shouldn't waste time. So I reduced to listen music and watch TV.  But I still watched TV in the evening because I had formed the habit. Finally I decided to break away [wd4,4-2]the habit. Every day I permited [fm2,-]myself to watch the news in the evening. Every evening I spent out four hours in doing homework. In the public holiday [np6,-0]I watched TV at most one hour. I will break away [wd4,3-2]the habit before go [vp5,1-2]to school. At that time I think I can break away  [wd4,1-2] the habit completely. I won't watch TV every day including the public holiday. What's the mean[wd2,-]? One day mother and I went to a restaurant for some food. I looked around the restaurant after I sat down at a table. I saw a man who can [vp6,5-4]  not speak sit down at the other table beside us. The waiter asked him what he wanted. The man opened his mouth, put his fingers in it and took them out gain. The waiter soon brought him a cup of tea. The man moved his head from side to side. The waiter took away the tea. In a moment hi brought a cup of coffee. The man again moved his head from side to side. At last the man put his hand on the stomach. At that time I understood what's the mean.[sn8,s] He wanted some food. In a few minutes there was a large plate of meat and vegetables in front of him. After that I learned his signs. I wanted mother to suppose what I wanted. But mother had seen that [wd5,3-3]  what had happened and ordered some food which I like [vp6,5-0].
 March 9. It was our turn to be on duty last week. It was the first week at [pp1,-3]the next term. Everywhere was very dirty. A lot of leaves spreaded [fm2,-]all over the table. Though hat, we were not afraid to clean them. We were afraid to get up so early. Every morning we must get to school before 7 o'clock. Some of us didn't have breakfast until the second class was over. Every day my team must clean the leaves. I thought my team was the most careful in our class. In that week all of us were very tired. But that week had gone [vp6,4-0]. We could sleep enough.
 March 15. We handed in some books for some poor children and some people in the country. It was the first time of the new term. Perhaps it was the last time. But it was very useful. I thought the books were more useful than money, because we handed in all kinds of books. So the poor children could learn [cc3,1-5]  the knowledge of all sides. This could make them recognize this world quickly. Some ways could make the people who lived in country improve the agricultural production, and improve their living condition. 

 March 23. Recently, I was surprised at two pieces of news. The first piece of news was about the clone experiment. When the person of world heard the news which the clone experiment has succeeded, [sn8,s]everyone was very surprised at it. Since the sheep was reproduced in British, everyone has been afraid of seeing a person will be reproduced. Though a lot of people were against this experiment, some people were for it. They thought this experiment could [vp9,4-3]  reproduced some organs what the patients needed.[sn8,s]The second piece of news was about examination. We must have a hearing [wd3,-]test in the examination. I was afraid to have a hearing [wd3,-]test. So I hope Miss Lin can give us a lot of chances to hear English in order that I can improve my hearing.
  March 30. Guang Zhou [fm2,-]  is a modern city. It had been [vp6,2-3]  a beautiful city. But today it isn't more beautiful than before. The smog in Guang Zhou [fm2,-]was sometimes so thick and filled with pollution.  I think the factories and homes burned the coal was a major cause.[sn8,s] The fog have [vp3,2-4]  so many harmful chemicals. People who lived  [vp6,2-10]  in Guang Zhou [fm2,-]  saw the sky and found it wasn't blue. It often have [vp3,2-2]some fog. So we must begin to solve the air pollution problem of GuangZhou. [fm2,-]  Otherwise it must do harm for our health. Another problem of Guang Zhou [fm2,-]  is the pollution of the Zhu Jiang [fm2,-]  River. If we do not solve the water pollution problem in time, the fish will no longer live in the river. I am eager o swim in it in the future. April 6. The date was April 4. We were going to run around the street in the morning. It kept on in the morning. I thought we didn't need to run. So I got to school at 7:30. When I got to school, a lot of students who were our grade were waiting in  [wd3,0-2]  the first floor. They were talking about if they must run in the rainy day. At last a teacher told us to walk with raincoats. We had to walk instead of running, because he street was very smooth[wd3,12-]. So I thought it was worth running in the rainy day, because it had lost its meaning[wd7,15- 0].  We talked everything with each other in the street. When we walked about five hundred metres, the teacher told us we needn't go on walking. Then we must [vp9,s]come back to school at once. So we were very angry. It made us waste a little time. I wondered why we should be sent to run.
 April 13. I have two tortoises in my home. I like them very much.They ave become my good friends. They are not longer than a finger. But they are very lovely. I spent 30 yuan on them. They have been here for a year. They half- hibernate in winter. They needn't a lot of food. They hardly makes [vp3,2-2]  any movement.Sometimes I will play with them. Sometimes I will observe their action. I find they like swimming and eat a lot of food. When I study in [wd3,0-3]  a long time, I will go to see them. After some time I will go on studying.
 April 19. The weather wasn't fine in this week. Sometimes it was sunny. Sometimes it was cloudy. When I left home. [sn2,3-0]  It was sunny. But when I got to school, it became cloudy. So I had to take the raincoat from time to time. But I was very angry.When I took the raincoat, it didn't rain. When I didn't take the raincoat , it rained. So I must take the raincoat in [wd5,0-2]  all day. I come to know when we do everything, we don't give up until we finish it. We must insist on studying hard.
 April 26. We had to study in chemical laboratory in [wd3,7-2]  four days. There is a playground in front of the chemical lab. Every time many students play or have a lesson in [wd3,0-2]  the play ground. There was a lot of noise affected [vp5,6-2]our study. It often drive [vp3,2-0]us mad. I was afraid the football hit [vp9,-]the top of the house suddenly. Though it had a lot of noise. [sn2,6-0]  We could play after class. After class we could [vp9,3-2]  played badminton [sn2,7-0]. Someone played board game. Someone played game in [wd3,0-3]  the play ground. All of us liked it very much. Four days had past.[sn9,-] I was very happy. I could leave there.
 May 2. The date was May 1. That day was Labour Day. My family and my grandmother, [wd4,6-6] my aunt went to Victory Hotel for breakfast. My uncle or my aunt used to lead me to the restaurant for breakfast in my childhood. My framily [fm1,-]and my grandmother's family often go the Hotel for breakfast in the festival now. So have lost interested in the food of breakfast. [sn8,s]Now , when I go to the restaurant or the hotel for breakfast, I must buy a piece f newspaper. I wouldn't have a lot of breakfast. I would rather read the newspaper and have a cup of tea than eat something. After breakfast we went shopping. At noon, I had lunch in my grandmother's family. Because I wasted a day, I had to give  going to the BaiYun [fm2,-]  Mountain. But I think we will have some changes to play together in the future.[sn8,s]
 May 11. We have had a new playground for a week. We can play on it in spare time. We only play basketball on it. But every day there must be a lot of students on it. After school some students would play basketball on it. They didn't go [vp6,2-5]  home until turned dark. Though it was raining. [sn2,3-0]  They still kept [vp6,2-3]  on playing basketball. [wd4,0-5] Saturday some student[np6,s] would come [vp3,4-7]  to school and play basketball on it. They made [vp6,1-4]  the school very busy. It was difficult o see so busy before the new playground had [vp7,11- 1]  completed. But I hoped [vp6,2-5]  it wouldn't affect their study.
 May. 18. My New School. 
My school is a key school. It has a history of seventy years. Many graduates had become [vp6,3-2]  famous people. Now there are thirty-six classes in my school. There are eighteen hundred students and over two hundred teachers in it. My school is very big and beautiful. Some trees grow all around it. There are two building [np6,1-2]  of teaching and there is a building of experiment. It has a big playground and students tend play or have a sport[wd3,-]  on it. The teachers are very excellent. They are strict with students. but [fm3,-]  the [wd4,1-3]  all of students respect their teachers. The students who study in it must study hard. Their teachers must be proud of them.
 May 24. It was [vp6,1-6]  difficult for me to learn English. Though I was [vp6,2-7]  weak in English, I found it interesting. I believed [vp6,1-4]  I could study well. I have studied English for three years. In these years I read more [sn4,5-6]  books and writed [fm2,-]  articles in English. I studied much harder so that I could improve it rapid progress. [sn8,s]After a few day, I tried to write articles in [wd3,5-1]  newspaper. I had ever[wd3,-] given [vp6,3-1]up. I still carried on a newspaper.[sn8,s]
 May 30. June 14. Today the temperature was about thirty. I saw about seven children swimming in the river. They were almost [wd7,-1]good at swimming. But who studied swimming first time or wasn't good at swimming, [sn2,10- 0]  he must swim in the pool. A little girl studied swimming in the pool, and her mother taught her. I used to swim in my childhood. I thought June was the best one of the year. About ten years ago, I spent holidays in Beijing, it was the last time that [wd5,5-2]  I swam. [sn1,s] June 15th. Litter: my dear friend: My name is Wen Hua. I am a student of No.1 Middle School in Beijing. I had [vp6,1-15]  to tudy far into the night, because I had a lot of homework every day. Cars must all keep to the right side of the road in Beijing.But in London, cars must all keep to the left side of the road. Almost [wd4,-1] people who live in Beijing go to work by bus or by bike. We work five days in a week, and every day we work eight hours. More and more people play in [wd3,0-1]  outskirts in [wd3,0-1]  weekend.

 Count Stars
 Tonight I work deep into the night gain. Having gone over my lessons, I began to look at the sky through the window, instead of going to bed immediartely[fm1,-]. After several days which with terrible weather, [sn2,5-0]  this night began turning nice.[sn8,s] You see, there're many twinkling stars in the sky. One, two, three, four ...... oh, there're so many stars that can't count out how many they are. [sn8,s]Why there're so many stars in the sky? I don't know but I think: the same as the stars, knowledge is also inexhaustible.[sn8,s] So I must try my best to study.
 June 14th.  Sunny. 
This afternoon was very hot, the temperature s about nearly [wd3,1-1]  30. Through the window, I saw seven or eight children swimming in the river, many of them are good at swim. [sn1,s]Among of them, a little girl was learning swim, and her mother was teaching her. Then I thought that my last swimming was in Beijing when I spent my holidays about ten years ago. I used to swim in my childhood, but now I haven't swam [fm2,1-] for about ten years, I think June is one of the best months in a year. [sn1,s]

 The new term has bigun. [fm1,-]  Let me introduce our class. Our class is an emphatic [cc4,1-1]  class, and has fifty-two boys, eleven girls in it. Our head teacher is Miss Lin.

 The Middle Autumn [wd4,2-4]  is a conventional festival in China, as the New Spring. The people over our country will congratulate [wd3,6-3]  in different form. In the night there be a noisy and amusing show full every family, [sn8,s]because people like to have a family reunion in the day.

For No one will forget the War of Resistance against Japanese aggression (1937-1945). No one will forget that miserable times and [cc1,2-]seasons. That's our Chinese shame! How can us  [pr4,2-1] forget! In the days, many people were killed by the enemy; many women were raped by the enemy; and many riches  [wd2,1-5]  also were robbed by the enemy. The Japanese Fascist brought with [wd5,3-4]  heavy sufferings to Chinese and ever Asia. But the Japanese Aggression are preparing [cc2,4-6]  for the other sinister plot again when they have not pay [vp6,4-6]  back for their criminal act still. ( To be continued)
 All These Things Are To Be Answered for (continued)
 In these days, all kinds of traces tell us ---- the Japanese Militarism will stage a come-back! Some Japanese right wing elements had put up a light- house in Diao YuDao in July. And the Japanese prime minister paid his respects to the JingGe Shen she,.... We wish the Japanese government don't do the foolish thinks again, because the new China is not the one of old.[sn8,s] All the people of Chinese [wd2,-]will not let it go! Get out from the DiaoYudao! Forget all these things what you had done are to be answered for![sn8,s]
 The Pond In My Home[sn9,-]
 My home has a little pond-- a goldfish pond. There are colour[cc1,-1] fish, peacock fish, dong yang knife fish and [sn6,10- 4]  there two Bazie tortoises in it. Over[wd3,0-7]  the pond there's a man made [fm2,-]  hill. A waterfall drop [vp3,-]down from the hill into the pond.  In the water there's much send[wd3,1-0], stones, corals and some water grasses in it. All of them make the pond very beautiful. The goldfishes [np6,-]lead [vp3,-]a freedom [cc1,-]life, but don't safe,[sn8,s]because the dong yong [fm3,-]knife fish will eat the little fish. So I set apart of them. [sn8,s]  Now they live all [ad1,2-1]  happly [fm1,-].
  Cold Autumn[sn9,-]
 Autumn is a beautiful and lovely season. Many people like it very much. Autumn is also a harvest season. In autumn many leaves turn yellow, and many fruits[np5] have riped [fm2,1-]. paddy [fm3,-]fields turn gold and [wd5,4-6]  like  sheet of gold sea. The whole world turns a gold world. Autumn is also a nice and cool season. People feel very comfortable. But it's also easy to catch fire, so people have to take [vp2, 1-2]  care tinders[fm1,-]. Even though this, I think Autumn is the best season as usual.
 The Football Game
 The football game is the first game in the world. All over the world millions of people take part in the football game. As much [np8,0-1]  people do, I like play football and watch football matchs [fm2,-]  too. In our school, many students play football matchs [fm2,-]  after a day of study at school, and so does [vp3,1-1]  I. I felt relaxing [vp5,2-2]  and exciting when I was playing the close game football with my classmases. [fm1,-]  I felt very exciting [vp5,3-0]  when I kicked the football into the ball door. Sometimes I watch football matchs [fm2,-]  in [wd3,0-1]  home, including the Chinese and the foreign countrys. [fm2,-]  As all the football game fans do, I like the world [fm3,-]  Cup best. Such as these, football is a part in my live [wd2,2-0].
 The Professor And His Invention Professor Hunter was very excited that morning because he had just finished the papers of is invention. And he was going to give his invention to London himself, but his daughter was sorry her father was not able to do that. So two men from London would come to take the papers to London. Before long two impostors came in [sn2,5-0]. be [wd5, 0-2]  Professor Hunter saw through them and gave the wroung [fm1,-]  papers to them. Then two policemen came in for catching the two impostors because they shut the men from London in an empty house and took away their cards. And then he would take the papers to London himself.
 Haven't Passed The Test
 Again I haven't passed the English test again this week, even though I have done hard in it[pp1,-]. But I think I have maken [fm2,-]  progress. In some part [sn2, 2-0]. For example I have done right ever seventy percent in the ingle choice. Before it I only passed. [sn2,3-0]  I tried to find out the reason from the test. I think I reviewed without ever all, because I have done very bad in read and fill up. [sn8,s]  I want to make bigger progress. Even though it will takes me long time  completed it. [sn8,s]I'll try my best and I'll succeed. Art Festival If you ask me which acts in our school I like best. I certain [wd2,1-2]  tell you I like the art festival in our school best. The art festival this year will hold [vp7,6-9]  in the PeiLei theatre on the New Year's Day in [wd5,0-2]  next year.
  Many student of every grade and every class are rehearsing warmly for the art festival, and the same as our class.[sn8,s]The art festival has rich content, for example: drawing, miting,[fm1,-] singing, drancing [fm1,-] ,little [cc4,-]making, little experiment and so on. I think the art festival this year will [vp9,7-7] more excellent than the one last year. I'm waiting [vp2,1-3]the art festival. The Bookshelf In My Grandma's Home[sn9,-] My grandma's home has a bookshelf and all the books are mine. The bookshelf is over my desk and on the wall which in front of the desk.[sn8,s]  It's about one metre high, one metre wide and trenty [fm1,-]centimetres thick. There are about one hundred books in [wd3,-2]my bookshelf, but the book about learning is over fifty percent.[sn8,s] Then other books are all kinds of dictionaries, navels, [fm1,-]  poems and so on. [sn8,s]All these books [cc4,2-5]  are my riches [cc1,-2]in knowledge. I could not have [cc3,3-3]  so much knowledge without book. So I like the bookshelf for book [wd5,4-0]. The Test Of The Term [cc1,1-1]  End The test of this term [cc1,1-1]  end is coming. it's a change to me because my test before it was very bad. [sn8,s]  My achievement [cc2,1-10]  stood in the lower reaches of river in my class. hat achievement wasn't what I had hoped. So I want to make a good achievement in the next test, now I wait till it. I must catch the change. [sn8,s]Now I must study harder than before. Or I will not make a great progress. And as the same importance. [sn2,4-0]  I must pay attention to have a good rest. Then I thing I will win the test of this term end.[sn8,s]

So everyone is very busy but happy. The same as passed, [sn8,s]the weather is very cold this[pr3,-1]days, and with little rains. Everywhere full of the beautiful scenery of spring in our Guangzhou. [sn8,s]  Everybody is waiting in hope [wd4,1-4]  the New Year's coming. Because the New Year isn't the New Year passed. [sn2,8-0]  It's the New Year of 1997. It's not an ordinary New Year.
 The Spring Festival
 The Spring Festival is the most important festival in China. In the Spring Festival many people feel the happies [wd2,4-3]in a year and extraordinary a child do. [sn8,s]People would [vp6,1-17]  buy some goods for the Spring Festival before the Spring Festival and name them New Year goods. In [wd3,0-4]the New Year's Eve, every family must have the New Year supper the whole family.[sn8,s]But this [pr3,-1]years many families like to have New Year supper in restaurants.

After forteen days the YuanXiao day is coming. and [fm3,-]with the day passed, then the spring festival is over. Such is the Spring Festival in China.
 My Winter Holiday
 My winter holiday only has thirteen days, but I think it's a solid winter holiday. In this winter holiday I must finish much homework, every day I do my homework, over three times and then go over my lesson, include during the Spring Festival. During the Spring Festival I haven't visited year so many times as the same last year for the so much homework and rain. This days I am going to finish my homework of the winter holiday, so I feel so relaxed. The new term is coming. I'll welcome it full of energy.
 After Study By Oneself
 In Evening [sn8,s]
Every evening after study by oneself I come home with Yuanyoungxi, Liangjiaqu and Chenguoyi together. [sn8,s]Sure, this evening isn't exception. During [wd3,0-3]  the way home, we talked while we rided [fm2,-]  bicycle. Always we talked about earning, film, football match, basketball match and any others. Now, we are talking about today's home work of methematics. [fm1,-]  Before long I got to my home and have to say goodbye to them. I just had a good time age. The talking makes me very relaxed and joyful every evening.
 Whiteboard
 This week every classroom in our school fixed up white boards instead of blackboards. The white board is made of iron. We use black water pen instead of chalk, then the history of teacher' using chalk is over while a new history begins. Of course, white board is good for people's healf[fm1,-], but like every new thing always has shortcomings. White board need to improve too. Through I am sure about the new thing ----white board has good future[np7,2-] without limit.
 How Funny Is He 
It was night. There was [vp3,1-4]  just a few people in the street and there were few cars were seen once in a while. [,9-0]  Four students let out of school ago. Now they were going home by bike side by side in the street by bike [wd5,9-0]. They were talking about something. Laughing voice was sent out from them now and then, suddenly there's a pile of sand in the street ahead, Yuan said to the other one ---- Feng :  look out!. .." but Feng didn't understand and looked at his friends as before. Of course, you all know what happened later: Feng stoke on the pile of sand. Feng isn't foolish, so we only say him: how funny hi is. But in any case it made us had a happy night that night.
 Beijing In My Eyes 
Beijing has many kinds of communication tool. But one of them is used widely in any other city and few in Beijing. This is motorcycle. I envy the Beijing's people very much at this. Though motorcycle run very fast, it's very dangerous. Many motorcycles in city also will hinder conditions and communication tool for public use. Now motorcycle is forbad many great cities [fm2,-] in the world. Beijing go faster than any other city this in China. When you walk on the street in Beijing, you well felt very safe and peaceful. As a great city in the national in the future, Guang zhou should begin to think about it.
 Red
 Red make [vp3,1-2]  people warm. Though in cold weather, hen you see red thing and you will feel warm [sn2,13-0]. Red is fire's colour. Red is revolution's colour. During revolution's revolution [wd7,2-0] , red mean [vp3,1-2]  new life.People like red. China needs red. When red is all over the country, the revolution will be won. At last, people's red blood made the revolution won. Later the national flag was dyed into red by people's red blood. When the national flag wave in the country, the red sun is rising from the old east. [sn2,16- 0]  The country exists for ever.

Three classmates finished singing, en it's turn to me [wd7,4-0]. I sang the song named "I Am Chinese". I sang the song only the high tide[cc1,-] part. Because of the limiting f time [sn2, 5-0]. I thought that I could enter the final after finished [vp5,1-1]  singing. Though I know the final is nothing with me, I glad to join in the match, [,7-0]  because it gave me a chance to practise.
 In The Finals
 Today I took part in the finals of the singers [cc1,-1]match because of the extra number. The finals include[vp3,1-] three parts: introduce my self, singing a song which you select, singing a song without accompanying in some parts. Though my head teacher had [vp4,-]gave me some advices[np6,-],I feel I sang in the finals not better than in the preliminary,[sn8,s] perhaps I felt critical in that time. [sn1,s]But to my surprise, I successed [wd2,-]finally. I became one of the "ten reat[fm1,-] singers" in our school instead of extra number.[sn8,s]
 Have A Lesson In Noice[sn9,-] 
This week we had lessons in the chemical lab because the [wd5,0-2]  Grade Three had modern examination in our classroom from Tuesday to this weekend. The chemical lab is very bad for us to have a lesson. Because when we were having a lesson, the students who in the other class were play [vp6,-]sport's game out of the lab. Sudently [fm1,-]you would heard [vp6,5-20]  a great noice [fm1,-]from the top of the lab, that is a football hited [fm1,-]the top of the lab weightly[cc5,6-].

People was very critical at that time and points rose one after another. As main forces Wang tao managed to win the plate. And the points was 31:29. The world record was broken! Finally our Chinese team won the men's team finals. They showed he heroic figure of our country's ball again.
 A Terrible Night
 I didn't study myself the night before last in school, though I had reached our classroom that night. What's the reason? Now I'll tell you. The night is a terrible night. Heavy raining, gale, lightening and thunder clap kept people in trouble riding on street. [sn8,s]Even severe,[sn2,s] Tai bao zhi street was covered by water and the water level was about half a metre. hat do you suppose? Yes, you are right. We could hardly go through the street. Sof [fm1,-]  when I got to our classroom [sn2,8-0]. I already looked like a hen in the water. Then Miss Lin asked us to went [vp5,3-1]  back. What a terrible night! Now you know the reason. Right?

Last week I was not lucky. I was not satisfied with my results in [wd3,2-2]  some subjects. The results gave me a message that I hadn't put my heart into study and there's nothing had been worth pride.[sn8,s] Since the new term started, I haven't study [vp6,2-1]  hard [sn4,5-5]  as I did last term, but some good results covered my problems. This time the problem was shown, it struck the warning [cc1,-1]clock for me. [sn1,s]Now I am at the crossroads, if I went along this road, I must fail one day, if I take a correct attitude forwards study, I still have a big [cc4,-1]hope. [sn1,s]It is not too late to mend the fold [wd7, 1-0] even after some of the sleep [wd3,5-3]have been lost. I have even written some articles to attack somebody and some systems. Miss hinted that my way to suggest is not correct and sensible. I still believed [vp6,2-0]  sb's[fm2,-] argument is [wd5,2-3] hold water deeply, but at the some time I admitted my manner and some sentences in my articles are so extreme and excessive that they will make sick [cc4,-]effect and hurt somebody. I say sorry to anybody that my articles have striken.[sn8,s] I know my view is too sharp, but I don't think my thesis is wrong in some question[wd3,-]. I keep my suggestion. I thank Miss, you make me know that some things are one of my business, so it is not necessary for me to speak at great length on some questions . [sn1,s] All the world are in the [wd5,1-1]  contradictory. I'd better put my heart into my study.
 Going into the state[sn9,-][sn8,s] The "Five-subject Test" will come in half and two months. Four of them have already been finished teaching and began reviewing four weeks ago. [sn8,s] At first, I couldn't grasp [cc3,2-2]the spirit on [pp1,-]how to go [cc3,2-3]over my knowledge, so I was pulled [wd3,-]by them. As time went on, I started to master [cc3,3-2]  some ideas and I felt I was going into the state. There are about two months that we take up our gauntlet : for a diligent student, the spare time was so full, but for a lazy one, it was little, which one I changed, it's depent[fm1,-] by me. I decided to be a diligent one. The streets I have been in the [wd5,1-3]  No.4 Middle School or almost five years, the streets around the school have no change, too. They are narrow and tattered in the ordinary times, the sick conditions of them are double in the rainy days. So it is difficult for us to pass. Now it is the rainy season, in the streets, there is mud, sand and dirty water here and there. And one street which I usually pass to go to school is been repaired.       There are some large holes and they block the traffic. So I am forced to pass: the other street to come or go to school. Why can such streets have been laid here for five years and no one step out and suggest? Why? Why? Why?
   Football and I 
My father is a football game an. Under the influence of my father, I was interested in football game, both playing and watching. As time went on, my interest in football became more and more. When I became one student of our class, I found that there were a lot of football game fans in it. So we had the same topic of conversation: football. The football movement in our class improves so quickly. And a group of master of football grow up. I don't play football so good, but I still take an active part in it. I wish the football movement in our country would be stornger [fm1,-]and stronger.
 Last week, two new  basketball playgrounds were finished building. This made me happy. We haven't seen a perfect basketball playground for four years, we didn't have enough palace to play since we were in grade Two. So it was worth having a celebration. In the other hand, the whole school was in deep sorrow at the news of our headmaster's death, for the people had come to love him as an inspiring leader and a wise, warm-hearted man. Mr. Wang is one of the greatest of all the leaders in our school. We believe that the living must finish the work of Mr. Wang. We remember him for ever. The tests of experiment. Last week, we had three tests of experiment of biology, physics and chemistry. In the ordinary time, I don't think it important to do experiments, so I didn't put my heart into it. So last week I was in a frantic rush to deal with three different and difficult experiments. I was so worried about that I would fail in them. In order to pass the xam I went to the lab to demonstrate the experiments before the text. Thank goodness, though I was so skilled and there were some accidents through the exams, but I still could pass the text.
 My new school
 My school is a key school with history of seventy years. Many students graduated from it have been famous men [,8-0]. y school is big and beautiful. There are a lot of trees around the school building. That gives the students a cosy [fm1,-]study environment. There are two teaching buildings, one experiment building and one large playground in the school, the students can have physical training in the playground. [sn1,s]Now, there are 36 classes in the school. Altogether there are 1800 students and 200 teachers. The style of study is so good that students study hard. [sn8,s] And the teachers are excellent and strict with students. students [fm3,-]  are [wd5, 1-4]  respect the teachers, too.

Dear May: Thanks you for your letter.  I am sending you a few advice[np5,2-] about gardening. First examine soil and ask your neighbours which plants grow best. Sow seeds at the correct time of the year. Don't grow plants in the same time year after year. If you remove weeds before planting plants, the plants will grow taller. Turn the soil over with a fork then sow seeds in the soil. Then the plants will grow well. Please write me soon. Yours[sn9,-] Li Baoling

I am a student in No.4 Middle School. I am in senion [fm1,-]  Grade Two this year. Every day I get up at six o'clock. Then I dress myself, clean my teeth, wash my face and have my breakfast. I usually go to school at seven o'clock. After I get to school, I read English and Chinese for about fifteen minutes. After that I make preparation for my lessons. At 8 o'clock we begin our lessons. We have eight subjects---politics, Chinese, maths, physics, chemistry, English, history and organisms [wd3,10- 0]. Of all the subjects, I like English and maths. After school I often play table tennis or do some reading in classroom. In the evening we must go over the lesson in classroom. After that I go home and go to bed at eleven o'clock.
 Sunflowers
 Have you ever seen sunflowers? I'm sure you have. They are growing here and there, before or behind houses, along roads or around the fields. A sunflower looks like a tree. But it's a kind of grass. It comes up in Spring and has seeds in autumn. Its flower smells wonderful and its seeds (we all say that it is [vp3,1-2]  sunflower seeds) are nice to eat and [sn9,-]  can also be made into oil. The most interesting thing about a flower is that it always faces the sun.  In the morning when the sun rise [vp3,3-0] , its face turns towards the east and in the afternoon towards the west still acing the sun. when  [fm3,-]  I was a puiple [fm1,-] , my classmate and I often plant  [vp6,5-2]  the sunflowers. But we always fail [vp6,3-0]. But we did not mend [wd3,4-0]. We are happy still, because we can do it ourselves. We have tried my best.

If the condition of the soil is not good, you should improve it. You can ask your neighbours how to do it. Then sow seed in the soil at the correct time of year.

Aswan Dam 
Three of the biggest man-made projects in the world are the Great Wall of China, the Pyramids of Egypt and the Aswan High Dam, which is also in Egypt.  The High Dam at Aswan was completed in 1970. It was built for several reasons. first [fm1,-] , the River Nile used to flood large areas at the same time every year and destroyed houses and crops. The new dam controls the waters of the Nile so that they now run regularly all through the year. Second, electricity can now be made from the water which rushes through the base of the dam. Now about 20-50Egypt needs is produced from this dam. The dam which is the biggest in the world, is 3,830 metres long. It is 980 metres wide at the base and 40 metres wide at the top. The lake that has been made by the dam is about 500 kilometres long. Before they began to build the dam, people already knew that there were going to be several problems. As a result of the dam, the water level of the lake was going to rise by 63 metres. It would be necessary to move 53,000 people from their villages. Also around the area of Aswan there are a lot of important old temples, which date [vp6,1-5]  from about 1250 B.C. these temples were in danger.

Aswan Dam. Three of the biggest man-made projects in the world are the Great Wall of China, the Pyramids of Egypt and the Aswan High Dam, which is also in Egypt. The High Dam at Aswan was completed in 1970. It was built for several reasons. First, the River Nile used to flood large areas at the same time every year and destroyed houses and crops. The new dam controls the waters of the Nile so that they now run regularly all through the base of the dam. Now about 20-50which Egypt needs is produced from this dam. The dam, which is the biggest in the world, is 3,380 metres long. It is 980 metres wide at the base and 40 metres wide at the top. The lake that has been made by the dam is about 500 kilometres long. Before they began to build the dam, people already knew that there were going to be several problems. As a result of the dam, the water level of the lake was going to rise by 63 metres. It would be necessary to move 53, 000 people from their villages. Also, around the area of Aswan there are a lot of important old temples, which date [vp6,1-5]  from about 1250 B.C. These temples were in danger; when the dam was finished, many of them would be covered by the waters of the new lake. One of the most important temples in danger was the one at Abu Simbel.

 Summer Vacation Diary 
 (1)  a trip for three days. I took a three-day trip during the summer vacation. The trip was very happy.

When we looked the house was too dark, too small and didn't have electric lamp [sn6,14-0] , we were suprised[fm1,-]. So we sent a lot of money to the people [wd4,9-7]  we hoped their living will [vp6,4-2]  be changed. Around the place we have visited, there are rice fields, cane [fm1,-]fields and vegetable fields. You can see fruit trees of the various kinds on the hills, and you can see the different mountains around the fields. And the " Xiao Bei Jiang" aross the places [wd7,7-0].

Many of us are making a plan for it. As usual, I'll make a plan, too. But this plan will be different from those I made before. I think it is time for me to know more about society. So I have decided to find a summer job during the holiday. In this way I can not only apply what I have learnt in class to practice but also earn some money to help support my family. This holiday I have two trips, and a long time to go to school. So I think this plan didn't realize. But this plan will be realized in next holiday. (3) .

All the chinese [fm3,-]  people thanks [vp3,6-2]  Lang Pin.  (4) . Hong Kong --- The Best I have seen. This month I went to Bankoy [fm1,-]. When I went to Guang zhou, I went throught Hong Kong. Before I went to it, I have had [vp6,7-10]  a wish that was go to Hong Kong before 97. I feeled [fm2,-]  Hong Kong is a very clean city. And the people in it are so king [fm1,-]  for [wd3,8-1]  us. And they were polite. They would wait in line when took bus, bought ticket [,4-0]  ... And I found that their people were very busy. They often have been in [wd3,4-4]  work for ten hours. They had supper usually in [wd3,0-4]  nine or ten o'clock in he evening. They did any work would be careful and fast [,8-0]. Hong Kong have [vp3,2-3]  many nice place [np6,2-0]. For example, Ocean Park,Wong Da Xian [sn2,6-0]. the top of the hill etc [sn2,5-0]. Hong Kong is the best city I love. Something about the Lesson " All these things are to be answer [vp7,6-1]  for" This week, we have learned the new lesson already. When I read the wholely [fm1,-]  story, I didn't think so the matter the boy and his sister had done [,12-0]. I thought if I was that beautiful girl or the little boy. I didn't do that. If I was the girl, I will [vp6,6-6]  pretend to marry [vp1,0-3]  to the nobleman. And after I became the nobleman's wife, he mustn't take precautions [np1,0-1]  me. So I will find a chance go give some poison in their food [,12-0]. When the nobleman died, I am to burn their house and farm. After I have done [vp1,3-0] , I died by myself. If I was the boy, I didn't force the nobleman to draw upon me [wd7,13-0]. On the contory [fm1,-] , I will make friends with that nobleman, and I will find a chance to take my sister leave the noleman's house. But nothing else, the two noblemen were dreadful. They must answer for they had done to the boy and his sister [,12-0]. I showed sympathy for the boy and his sister.

On every street, the shop [np6,1-8] , the factory [np6,1-6]  had put [vp6,8-8]  up the national flag [np6,2-4]  for a few days.

A flag-raising cermony[fm1,-] was being held in Bei Jing [fm2,-]  Tian An Men.

There are more than twenty pages, ten compositions to write. I thought it important for us to how to spend this holiday. We should [vp9,1-3]  did more best [sn4,6-0]  in our homeworks[np5,-], went over our lessons in his holiday. Because next term we will have the five subject exam [sn2,9-0].And the next year, we will meet the exam of pass the Guang [fm2,-]  Dong [fm2,-]

Because they hoped the children will have a good time n next year [sn2,12-0] ! 
 Go to the Flower Street 
There are four Flower streets in Guang  The big one is Jiao Yue Lu Flower street. It sat [vp6,1-7]  down in he middle of Guang zhou, since it sat down in the good place, so t was very bustling. On [wd5,1-2]  one day, I went around it with my good friend.  I saw many flowers in it. And the interesting thing as: here are some little shop [np6,2-0]  which sold the small thing in it.   They sold some puzzle, some viles, [wd4,5-2] some beautiful bottles. They' re very interesting. Today, I was very happy! Wish all the people in our country were happy too [,9-0]. 
  Go to the World Wonderful Sight. 
 Tolday [fm1,-] , it looks warm and rainy. We went to the World Wonderful Sight. We were happy today. We saw some stange [fm1,-]  thing [np6,2-0]  in there. There are some trambles[fm1,-], some halls, [wd4,5-0] some buildings in it. The best thing in it was when the evening coming, we saw the good play in the middle of the park. After the play, we saw the flim [fm1,-]in waters.  They are very interesting! P. /S.  HAPPY New Year   Miss Lin   Gillian
  Greatest Changes 
This Monday, when we got to our school classroom. [sn9,-] we saw the classroom had great [wd2,1-1]  changed. There are many white boards. Instead of the old blackboard  [sn2,4-0]. Because the new while [fm1,-1]board is in great use for the teacher  [sn2,11-0]. They don't breathe he ash of chalk. This will help their health. But this is the new thing. We don't be used[aj2,-1] of looking[vp1,-1] this. I think after serval[fm1,-] days, we will write the [wd4,3-5]  white board in large letters. 
  I like my school 
 My school, Guang zhou the No.4 Middle School, lies in the west of Guang zhou City with a history of seventy years. There are a classroom buildings [np6,2-0] , a lot of lab building [np6,4-0]  and a library in it. e have thirty classes of six different grades. There are over wo hundred teachers and over two thousand students in my school.   The school offers twelve courses, including chinese [fm3,-] , English, mathenatics [fm1,-] , physics, chemistry, biology, politics, music, art, P.E., computer, and English typing. It's nice school [np6,2-0]  and we all love it. 
 Change
 Our family lived in Guang zhou for many years. And for many years, Guang zhou was a good place to live. The streets were clean. The parks were safe. The people were friendly. But Guang Zhou changed. Today the streets aren't clean. The parks aren't safe. The population is increasing. he reason which made his change is the other provinces people. hey though [fm1,-]  Guang zhou is a very good place to make money. So lots of them came to Guang zhou to work. The increasing population made[cc5,-2] rubbish increase. Because not all of them can be invited, so some people go to steal or rob. This made Guang zhou not safe. I think they are too disgusting to stay here. 
The Importance. 
 Last night, I had [vp6,3-3]  seen [wd3,4-2]  the newspaper. From the newspaper, I knew that the NMET will be have listening text in next year. And the important is must add the result of listening text up to the NMET [,14-0]. So we must pay attention to training our listening. When I heard this news, I began to decide a plan to train the listening.That is I will listen to the radio when I get up from go to school [,7-0]. During this period, I will listen [vp2,0-4]  the type [wd3,6-3]  of the lesson. I think it is useful for me to improve the listening. Miss Lin, can you give good iders [fm1,-]  to improve my listening except this? I think you will give me some advice, will you? Thank you! 
 Miss White: Good morning! I couldn't go to school today. ecause I am not felling well tomorrow morning [sn2,7-0]. After got up [sn2,2-0] , I ad a headache and had a little fever. My mother wanted to take me to [wd4,2-2]  medical examination. So I asked or one day's leave. I hoped [vp6,1-4]  you will allow me! Thank you! Your truly: Lillian.

Every woman which [pr5,2-8]  has a child on yesterday was very happy. cause they were praised for her great [sn2,6-0]. when she laid [cc3,1-2]  a child, she must take care of the baby. When the baby grew, she had to [vp5,1-5]  sent her child to school. She must be careful of her child's study, and the child's health. So, mother is the greatest human in the world.

Miss Lin, what did you sent to your mother? 
 My New School 
My school is a key school. It is seventy years old. Many students who were gratuated[fm1,-] [wd4,4-4]  have been famous people. My school has 36 classes now. And there are 200 teachers in it. y school is very big and beautiful. Some trees stand around the chool building. It has two school buildings and one lab and a big playground. The playground, which we often play on it [wd5,7-0] , and [sn6,10-3]  have many exercises. The teacher teach [vp3,2-1]  well. they [fm3,-]  are strict with us. They have rich experiences, we all show respect to them. [sn1,s]  My hometown My hometown lies in the south of Yang dong Couty [fm1,-]. It stands beside the low green hills. It has more than 90 families. There is about 500 people. Great changes have taken place in my hometown these years. Some new houses and new schools have been build [vp7,3-0]. An food processing factory has been set up in the west of it. The crop have [vp3,2-2]  been good. so [fm3,-]  the agricultural production is going high. Some peasants buy the motorbikes. They are becoming richer and richer. My home town is very beautiful and the people in it were [vp6,11-2]  very kind. So I love my home town very much. 
 June 14th. Sunday       sunny. 
 This afternoon is very hot. The temprature [fm1,-]is about 30c. I think this time is good for swimming. I see some children swimming in a river. Some of them are good players. In the middle of the river, a little girl is learning swimming. Her mother teaches her how to swim. When I see this scean[fm1,-], I think about I often swim [vp6,5-3]  in my childhood. The last swimming was in Beijing in spending my holiday ten years ago.[sn8,s] I think June is the best month in one year. I like June very much! 
 There is going to a lecture on June 4th. That day is Wednesday, and the lecture will begin at two o'clock. It will be lasted [vp7,3-2]  two hours. The lecture will be held on the big playground.

 The world is strange and unfair. Women can be elected beauty, but men havn't.[sn2,s] Every woman wishes to be beautiful. So they join every select beauty match [cc1,2-]. If she wins he match, she will cry out : "oh [fm3,-] ! I get it! I get it!" From then n, her life will be changed. Because she has "changed" into a beauty [sn2,6-0]. Though men have strong muscles, handsome looking, ense[fm1,-] of humor and learned brain, they have to be audiences. And because of these, they couldn't "change" their lives. And this is why men must work hard at their works [np5, 2-0]. Aha! Sex! help [fm3,-]each other
 We are very lucky. Because we have completed body [sn2,4-0]. Somebody will think it usual: every one has a completed body, nothing strange. But the deformity hope to have completed body very much. They have each drawback. They would be lame, blind, deaf or dumb. Because of these, they havn't[fm1,-]the happness [fm1,-]like the ordinary persons. On ordinary days, they have more difficulty than any other person when they do things. They would be treated unfair without any season [sn8,s]. They are innocent. No body wants to be a deforming person. If a man have [vp3,3-1]  hair, he won't want to be blunt [wd7, 12-0]. We should help each other, especially to the deformity. When they are in trouble, they want that anybody would help him. If we help them at that time, they could feel warm in their hearts. Let's help each other, [wd4,4-5] make the world full of warm.Boss Many people want to be a boss. But after they become rich, they don't know how to act as a boss. Here, let me teach them. First, he must " throw away" their wifes [fm2,-]  who help and stay with him when they [pr3,16-3]  are in trouble. So they can lead different woman back home very night. Second, he must call for a taxi or buy a car when he goes out. It is very "cheap" to ride a bus. It coundn't[fm1,-] show that they are bosses. Third, because of a boss, you must speak some English words in your talking. At[pp2,-1] less, you must know "OK", "Yes", "No", "Very good" and so on to show your "knowledge". Last, you must make some cards with your name. when you see everyone, like beggar, neighbour, pedlar [sn2,7-0]  (D?). So everyone will know you are a boss. After this, you are really a boss. 
 Rain 

The rain will never stop. Raining, raining, raining, from morning to evening, from evening to morning, it still rains hard.  I don't know where the water comes from. The ground always is wet. If a little piece of ground is going to be dry, a heavy rain will make it wet again. Because of rain, umbrella, shoes, rainboots[fm2,-]and rain coat can be seen everywhere. The shop which sell them has [vp3,5-2]  many [np8,0-1]  business. The shopkeeper is very happy for these. Ah! Raining, Raining, Raining again! terrible [fm3,-]women 
There are some women. They haven't powerful mucle [fm1,-] , smooth teeth and lots of money. But when men see them, men will turn soft like a sheep. If the women call [wd3, 3-4]  them to the west, men dare not go to the east; if the women all them to it, en dare not stand. All the men's money must be handed to he women every month. If the men want to use a fen, first he must make a report. With the women's permitting, then hey can receive he money from the money and use it. But it is interesting at the men like these are [wd5,9-3]  always become rich after several years. People name the women " tiger wife". My New school My school is a key school which has a history of 0 [wd7,11-0]. Its [np4,0-5]  many graduates have become famous person [np6,4-0]. Look! There are thirty-six classes, 1800 students and more than 200 teachers. 
  Our school is large and beautiful with trees around it. school has two teaching-building [np6,1-0] , a build [wd2,1-2]  of experiment and a big play [cc4,-]ground. Now, students are doing excesics [fm1,-]  on the play ground. Our teachers are excellent. They are strict with students and the students respect their teachers. I like this school. Pencil-box. I wanted to buy a pencil-box. When I got to the shop, "oh [fm3,-] ! My God!" most of the designs of the pencil-boxes were for girls. A girl with long hair was playing with rabbit; Bon Bon Cat and so on [sn2,5-0]. Oh! Who is Bon Bon Cat? A cat can throw bombs and make a very loud noise "Bow"! or a cat can eat bomb hen the bomb explodes in its belly (??). Fortunately, I didn't buy the "Bon Bon Cat". I bought a pencil-box------ "Con Con Monkey"!

 June 14, 1997. Saturday   sunny 
It is hot today. In this afternoon, the temperature is nearly thirty centigrade. There are about seven or eight children are swimming. Many of them are ood t swimming. A little girl is learning swimming, and her mother  teaching her. I remember that when I was a child [,7-0]. I ofter [fm1,-]  go [vp6,4-1]  swimming. My last swimming was about ten years ago when I was spending holiday in Beijing. I think that June is one of the best month [np6,4-3]in a year. 
 Time. 
Time pass [vp3,1-1]  fast. A week is over again in the nervous exams. he final exam is coming nearer and nearer. But I feel that I ill have many things to do. Perhaps I am lazy. It is because I haven't firmly grasped [cc3,3-2]  the time. I like thinking, illusion. And this wasted me many [np8,3-1]  time. So, I have done less work. The final exam is coming! Work hard!

 Beginning of the new term After a very short " inter holidays" which had only laten[fm1,-] for two weeks, having finished the homework which was so much that we must do it all through the holidays, we began to have the added classes [, 36-0]. In fact it is as pressing as regular classes. So our new term began.  And we became busy by then. Only after few days, the homework that the teachers gave us became more and more. The most serious one is Chinese. We must finish almost twenty pages of an exercise book which was just handed out two days before. In the second week, we had three exams. This term seems to be a very busy term [wd6,8-0]. 
 Going bankrupt
 It was [vp6,1-8]  only two week [np6,1-0]  since the new term began. But we had paid [vp6,3-5]  a large number [wd3,2-2]  of money. At first we must hand in the money for registring [fm1,-]. In this term it raised [vp7,s-]  to almost 00 an. The notice said that it was because the price of paper had en risen  [vp7,7-0]. It also said that there was almost 100 yuan overspent. How can the teachers take decisive action without asking for approval and only report it later as a fait [fm1,-]accompli[fm1,-]! How can they use our money that haven't [vp3,7-3]  been handed over! [sn9,-] It was said that the reward of the added classes would be collected fore[fm2,-] long. It takes 80 yuan. If it go [vp3,2-3]on like this, we will go bankrupt sooner or later.the [fm3,-]whiteboards[sn9,-] Now the teachers in our school needn't be harm[vp7,1-] by the dust of the chalk any more.[sn8,s] It is because that the blackboards[fm1,-] in our school was changed to whiteboards last week. The students sitting the front of the classroom benefit[fm1,-] from it too. After the whiteboard was use [vp7,4-0] , the air became cleaner than before, but after used some times [sn2,3-0] , the white board becomes dirty.And the white board is hard to be dry. This prevent [vp3,1-5]  us from writing on it. This must be settled by the ones on duty by keeping the cloth dry. 
 Close the door
 On [wd5,0-2]  last Thursday, when we were having a chemistry class, dust [wd7,0-6]  was burned on the play ground.  The smoke and the smell went upstairs and came into the classroom through the backdoor. We were sitting near the back door. The smell make [vp6,2-2]  us uncomfortable. So we closed the door to keep it out. Soon after that, our head teacher, Miss Lin, came and asked us to open the door. We told her about the bad smell. But she insisted that we must open the door. Then there came gust. The smell of the lavatory was bring[vp7,-]to us. As soon as we were going to close the door, Miss Lin came and prevented us again. And we were scolded for it. 
 Running 
 This Thursday we were told that there would be running surrounding [wd3, 1- 4]  the Jin hua street on [wd5,0-3]  the ext day, so we had to come to school at 7:10. In [wd3,0-2]  Friday morning, it rained very hard. I thought that the running must be given up, so I wnet[fm1,-] to school at the time we have [vp6, 8-6]  the morning reading on ordinary days. When I got to school, I saw many students of the No.11 middle school running along the road. In the school, I was told that we had to run, even in rain. After having run several hundred mertres [sn3,5-6] , the rain became harder and harder, so that we can stop [vp6, 9-1]  running. 
  Chess
 Now we have little [np7,1-]thing of entertainment to do in our room. It lies [wd3,-]in our head teacher. In these days, we had been [vp6,5-4]  forbidden to play football unless it was on [wd3,0-4]  the phsiclal[fm1,-] training class, forbidden to play the Five Pieces Chess, even forbidden to play the Chinese Chess [sn2,13-0] . But soon we found another game to play. It was the Flying Chess. Though it seemed very silly, we thought it fairly interesting in the games we can [vp6,9-0]  play. Everyday, as soon as the class is over, serval[fm1,-] groups of classmates get together and play Flying [fm3,-]  Chess [fm3,-]. This make  [vp3, 1-2]  me think that the Flying [fm3,-]  Chess [fm3,-]  will be forbidden to play sooner or later. 
 Questions and answers 
The year 1997 has come. On July 1, Hong Kong will be returned. It's  great day for China, so we held a questions and answers match bout Hong Kong to celebrate [sn8,s-]. The match was divided into two parts. The first part was the problems essential to be answer [vp7,4-0]. Every group must pick out five of the problems and answer it [pr3,8-0]. at the beginning, the match was fair, but as time went on, some classmates began to shout and prevent the other groups from answering question. The second part was the problems to try to be the first to answer [,13- 0]. Because of the fourth group's cheating, they won at last . Since it is just a game, why not play fairly and happily? Too much homework April was going to end, and the examination of graduation was coming. every [fm3,-] subject made full use of all the time to give classes and reveiv[fm1,-].[sn8,s] All the things were carried on in a hurry. Besides the curriculum's quickly going on, the homework was so much that it became terror. Every day there would be some exercise papers handed out, such as Chinese, physece [fm1,-] , chemistry, English...., all the time had to be used to do the paper. [sn1,s] To finish all the homework and paper, we were made to be of great urgency. Every day there was full of work around us. How terrible it was! In the chemistry lab. Last week the [wd5,0-2]  senior three were going to have the simulate examination. Because there were too many students, the classrooms were not enough. So the [wd5,0-2]  senior two had to lend them the classrooms and moved to the lab to have classes.   Having classes in the chemistry lab was very unconvenient[fm2,-]. It was trouble to get boiled water. The lab was very far away from the mansion, so every morning we went to get boiled water group by group. This would late to the morning reading [,6-0]. It was very bad [wd3,-] for the teacher to get there to give us lessons. They must [vp9,1-2]  got down from the fifth floor long before the class began, and get back to the fifth floor after class. The only conveniet [fm1,-]thing was to play balls. When the class was over, many students would rush out and play basketball, football .... Nearly half of the play ground was occupied by us. The experiment exams This Tuesday and wedesday [fm1,-]  there will be experiment exams of physics, biology and chemistry one after another. This took us into the tide of experiment [np6, 4-0]. The physics lab and the biology lab opened for us to some practice [wd2,8-0]  these days. But there were so many students in the lab hat it became confusion. This brough [fm1,-]  us much diffculty[fm1,-] in doing experiment. He[fm3,-] mot[fm1,-] trouble thing was to see the video recording of physics experiment. It would be [vp6,2-5] showed  [fm2,-]  at  [wd5,1-3]  last Tuesday night. his made the students didn't need to go to school at night stayed at school [,14- 0]. But at that night, after waiting for more than half an hour in the basement, we were told that the  videocorder [fm2,-]didn't work. We had to see it on Friday afternoon. Imminent as now, [sn2,s]the teachers never let us be free. They gave even more homework and exams. How can we review well? 
My new school
 My school was [vp6,2-3]a key school with a history of seventy years. Many students graduated from our school had been famous. The school has thirty six[fm2,-]class [np6,2-0]. Altogether, there are about one thousand and eight hundred students and more than two hundred teachers and workers. Our school is large and beautiful. Many green trees are planted around the school building. In the school, there are two building [np6,1-0]  for teaching, one building for experiment and a large play ground. The students can have sports on the lay ground. The teachers in our school are excellent. They are very strict with the students. [sn9,-] and the student respect them. Playing Basketball Since the basketball [cc1,1-1]  court was built in our school, the tide of playing basketball came into being in our class. Many classmates play basketball after school, at noon and in the evening. Our head teacher, Miss Lin, forbids them to do that and stops them by all the ways.[sn8,s] But the tide last [vp3,3-4]to the night now. On Tuesday night, six students of our class played basketball after the self-study at night. When Miss Lin passed by and noticed it, the students dissipated at once. But at last they were captured eventually. Playing basketball is a good deed, but playing late into the night is too excessive. 
 June 14, 1997. Sunny. 
Today was very hot, the air temperature was nearly thirty [wd4,-]centigrade. [sn1,s] Walking near the river, I saw some children swimming in it. most [fm3,-] of them swam well. A little girl was studying [wd3, 0- 1]  swimming, teached  [fm2,-]  by her mother. The weather was so hot that every body wanted to have a swim. I used to swim in my childhood. About ten years ago, I had the last time of swimming while I was spending my holiday in Beijing. Since then, I had never had [vp6,5-2]  a swim. I regarded June as one of the best month [np6,5-0]in a year.

 The fourth week. 
Time is leaving [cc2,2-1]  quickly. I have had English classes for four weeks. Before this week, I was very afraid of you when you asked somebody to answer your questions. Because my English is not so well [ad2,5-0] , speaking is worse than writing. Then I thought: ther people will laugh at me when I give a wrong answer. I will fell [fm1,-]  sorry for this. In this week, I found my classmates didn't laugh at me after you asked me. I thought: in act, I am afraid of you for I doesn't [vp3,7-2]  believe myself.  If I try my best, nobody laugh [vp3, 1-2]  at me and they are friendly to me. So I decide; I must study hard. Don't let my teacher and parents desappoint [fm1,-]. The fifth week. Because National Day is coming, there are four days for rest. What will to do in these days? [sn8,s]Except shopping, playing, watch TV, go over the homework [sn2,8-0]. Have any else [,2-0] ? Yes, it is sports.I often didn't [vp6,2-12]  get up until 10 o'clock when I needn't go to school ago. One day my father talked with me about this matter. Through father's words, I knowed [fm2,-]  it wasted time for I got up late. I must get up early and have [wd3,0-2]  some sports. It's helpful for [wd3,2-1]  me. Then I do so. When I came into the stadium the first [sn2,7-0]. I thought it is [vp6,3-9]  pleasant o breathe the fresh air in the morning. There liked a beautiful picture. [sn8,s]There were green tree [np6,3-0] , green grassland, the orange sun, little birds and the happy people in it. How good was the feeling! Ever since then, I insist [vp6,-]to get up early and have [cc3,-]sports. 
 The six Week 
A very unhappy thing was happened [vp7,5-3]  in this week--- my little tortoise is dead. I cried for it over a night. Though he didn't come into my home so long, my family got on well with him. We have been good friends. I had had two tortoises before "my friend" died. But perhaps they have made friends with Karl Marx. Then I liked "my friend" than before because he was the last one and I very [ad2,1-9]  regard that I hadn't taken good care of them. So I tried my best to treasure him. But I couldn't change the thing, the little tortoise [wd4,-]still as died [sn1,11-0]. [sn1,s]I lost a good friend. He leaves me for ever.  I couldn't excuse me. But I hope dear tortoise can find his friends and become happiely [wd2,10-0].

In the past few days, the people of Guang zhou were interested in a thing. That was Guang zhou if it can be elected a health city of country [,13-0]. All the people of Guang zhou did some cleaning for it. people [fm3,-]  worked as one and tried hard to make Guang Zhou cleaning. There were just two days for rest, my family began to do some cleaning. [sn1,s]I like health, but I don't like to clean. I believe it is a hard work. But when I saw my Dad and Mum worked [vp5,7-1]  carefully, I couldn't free [cc3,2-2]  my hands. Then I did with them.My job was cleaning the windows. When I was cleaning, Mum said to me: " Should we take a watch [wd7,-]for cleaning the windows quickly? " " OK. It's [pr2,0-4]sure I will win." I anwered. Then we began to take the match.

At last, the winner was Mum, but I was praised by them.Because the window of I cleaning were very bright [sn2,8-0].After that, I didn't hate do some cleaning any more.

 The Ninth Week. Miss Lin handed out the English test paper yesterday. I got 71 marks. Though I passed this test, I believed 71 marks was very bad. This test was for Unit 2. It only has two lessons' knowledge.[sn8,s] How a few contents [sn2,3-0] ! But I only got 71 marks. The examination will come soon. In that time, how I can...if I can catch up with other classmates in a short time, I must study hard[ad3,s-] than before and give up bad habits. What is [vp3,1-3]my bad habits? It is slow to do things. I often do things slowly than others [sn4,6-0]. Example: doing homework, doing housework, even clearing up my school-bad [sn2,11-0]... This test paper was done so bad, the important reason was this. [sn1,s]I try to give up it [wd1,5-0]. I must study hard. No pains, no gains. The Tenth Week. My house has a " garden in the air". There are many flowers in it. they [fm3,-]  are planted by my dad. I like them very much. When you go into it in early morning, you will feel the air is very fresh. After water the flowers, some drop of water slide follow the flowers [,11-0]. In the sun, it looks like some crystals. That is very beautiful. In the autumn wind, leaves shake slightly. And looks like to say " Good morning" to you [,8-0]. When you breathe the fresh air look [sn9,-]  at the plants and do some sports in the morning, how happy is it [wd1,3-0] !The "garden in the air" gives me much interest and tells me much [cc4,-]knowledge about plants. Example : How to plant flowers? How to manage them? When do they bloom? Why people say " last briefly" ?... [sn8,s] And it tells me the important thing is not to pluck flowers and take good care of them. 
 The Twelfth Week. In this week, I became a farmer from a student. The feeling was very interesting and intructive [cc4,6-0]. I was happy and worried before we set out. Happy, because we have just taken the exam, now we can loose [sn2,11-0] . Worried, because the military training was very tired, I afraid of this as tired as the military training [,17-0]. When we reached the base, and began to work, I found to become a farmer was tired [aj4,7-0]. But there was happy in it [,5-0] . I worked with the classmates, we sang together, smiled together, all  the unhappy thinks were forgeten. [sn1,s] Through this farmer's work, I learned [cc3,0-4]  a lot of knowledge. I think I can't forget it in my life. 
 The Thirteenth Week. On Friday afternoon, our class had a meeting for choose [vp5, 6-4]  the monitor and cadres. It was the first time since we came to this class. So we were so glad. Because this meeting was a democratic work-style [sn2,8-0]. It can be shown [vp7,3-2]  our ideas. We can choose the monitor and cadres who we all like the [wd5,8-1]  best. It can be given [vp7,3-6]  all the classmates a fair chance. Because our eyes were clear [sn2,4-0]. If you do the work very good and really put the heart into how to help classmates [sn2,16-0]. We can see. Everyone can prove oneself and find one's shortcoming at the same time.The result was shown. It proved our ideas was very right. My good friend Xuan Yunsheng had the most ballots. All the people believed her [pr4,4-4]  can accept this work. She was very happy.I was verry [fm1,-]happy for her, too. I must learn from her. 
   The Fourteenth Week. We went to Pei lei cinema and saw the film on Saturday this week. I believed it was very bored [aj4,5-4] before I saw it. But my idea was wrong completely. The film was exciting and moving and angering[fm1,-]. When I saw the Chinese severely scolded [vp5,6-2]the Japanese, I was exciting [aj4,2-0] ;when I saw : the Chinese common people left their home and become [vp6,8-2]  a fugitive; the children left their parents, no food, no clothes, cried on the street; the old person saw their lands became ruins and cried bitterly, I was very moving [aj4,3-0]. When I saw : the Japanese named himself " the king of the Heaven", they made trouble out of nothing, tried [sn6,18-13]to agression [wd2,-]China and impudented [wd2,-]to make China pay for the war reparations, I angered [wd2,-]very much. Though Japanese likes strongly,[sn8,s]Chinese are never afraid of them. In the end, we united and be [vp4,-1]winner. As a Chinese, I must remember July 7th , 1937, must remember the Chinese history. [sn1,s]I must place the interest [np6,4-6]of the country above everything else. 
 The Fifteenth Week. I took part in the team of geography in the seventh and eighth lessons on Friday this week. It was very interesting. I wasn't interested in geography all along. Then the base [wd3,2-3]  is very bad. In the junior middle school, I was absent-minded to have the lessons of geography [,15-0]. At that time, geography wasn't diffucult, I depended on my memory to have [vp1,-1]tests. [sn1,s]And often passed them [, 3-0]. But in the senior middle school now, understanding is very important to learn geography, so I want to get good grades is impossible [,22-0]. So such were the facts, I believed I can't change it. [sn1,s]I known [fm2,-]  my base [wd3,5-2]  was bad, this was fact. [sn1,s] But since I took part in the team of geography, I came to be interested in geography. It told me a lot of knowledge about the earth and something in the earth. [sn8,s]Some think looks like very strange ago, [sn8,s]but now it made me understand the fact and the truth. Now I believe it isn't very difficult be [vp5,7-3]  learn geography better. 
 The Eighteenth Week. The Emperor's new clothes Long long [wd6,-] age there loved [wd3,4-2]  an emperor, he cared more for the beautiful clothes thatn [fm1,-]  for anything else. [sn1,s]The cheat knew the emperor liked fine few clothes, then they came to tell the emperor that they were the best weaver [np6,4-0]  and they can weave [vp6,2-17]  a kind of cloth which the people of stupid or unfit for their office could not see.[sn8,s]  The foolish emperor believed them easily and gave them some gold to let them weave the cloth for him. The two cheats set up two looms and pretended to work day and night. After some time, the emperor sent his old Prime Minister to see how the cheats were getting along with his cloth.The old Prime Minister went to see and could not see anything. But he didn't want to let anyone know he was unfit for his office. Then he told the emperor the cloth was very wonderful. Before long the emperor sent another official to see the cloth again. The official could not see anything, but his anwer [fm1,-]  was as same as the Prime Minister [sn4,11-0]. The emperor was very pleased when he heard the official's words. So he decided to have new clothes make of the splendid cloth for the procession.[sn8,s] The procession began. The emperor walked in the street and have [vp6,7-3]  the "new clothes". Many people pretend [vp6,2-4]  to see the clothes, but suddenly a little child said: " He has nothing on!" His words was whispered from one to the other. At last, the braver people cried they couldn't see anything at all on the emperor. The Emperor heard the cries and he knew that the people's words were true, but he went on the procession to keep [wd3,1-2]  his face. 
 The Nineteenth Week. In this week, all the items of our chool's art programme have passed the first try. My class there were a lot of programmes have entered the last match.[sn8,s]  And some programmes of our class have won the prize. Example: we won [wd4,1-1] first place on the programme of flowers. And we won the third place on the programme of the handicrafts. These was a [np7,0-2]  exciting news for us. It also greatly encourage [vp3,3-1]  us. Through our school's art programme, we can see everyone loves our class, and school very much. They aren't only speaking but also doing. They took an active part in this art programme. They didn't mine[fm1,-]if they couldn't win the prize. The important thing was they could try their best for class. Then everyone rehearsed again and again, no one mined [fm1,-]tired and hard. [sn1,s] Such is our class, it is making progress. 
 The Nineteenth Week We took part in our school's art programme in the Peilei theatre today. We shared in the pleasure of it. as a NO.4 Middle School's student, we were proud of our art programme had so high level [,17-0]. But all the thinks[wd2,-] could not leave [cc2,6-9]  teachers and students' hard exercise and the others' support. Example: In my class, Ao Jingya, Tao Xin, Chen Xiaocong, Ye Jiaqing, Li Yongming and Lui Siming made sixty-one card [np6,1-0]  on which there were-and [wd7, 10-0]  ---. In order that our class could make a good atmosphere [sn2,9-0].They went on doing this work until 10 clock last night. Today on the art programme, when Liang Shaoying was singing, all the class Two's students put up our these --- and ---, and shaked [fm2,-]  them [wd7,24-0]. At this time, we moved [vp7,4-1]  deeply, I thought Liang Shao ying was, too. [sn1,s]This was the most support for her, and she must be encouraged greatly. I deeply wish our school's art programme will be made better and better, because it has many people's support. 
 The Twentieth Week 
My mother is a common woman, she has the Chinese women's nature: kind, good nature, honest, hard working and thrifty. [sn1,s] And she is impatient, then she hates [cc3,-1]slow very much, and she does what she ays at once. It sure that is not a shortcoming but I believe it is a big shortcoming. [sn8,s]Because I often do things slowly [sn2, 5-0]. I am different[aj2,-1] for her, no ways, I am often taught by her. [sn1,s]She grow [vp3,1-3]  old and querulous. Then my ear is worse [sn4,4-0]. Example: Sometimes I got up late, she must [vp9,1-3] :" Dan, be [cc5,1-1]  quickly! be [cc5,0-1]  quickly! now [fm3,-]  is 7:30!" " ah [fm3,-] ,7:30? God save me!" I think aloud and get up at once. When I look at the watch, it shows 6:40. OH! My mum! When I dress, her voice is said again: [sn8,s] " Dan, be [cc5,0-1]  quickly! It's so late. You will [vp9,1-3]  late for school if you don't hurry. Do you dress ok?" " ok [fm3,-] ! I'll be all right." Two minutes passed, she says again: [sn1,s] " The breakfast will be cold. Quickly! " ... This is my mum. though [fm3,-]  she sometimes so trouble [sn2,6-0] , but [wd5,9-8]  I know she loves me, loves our family. So I love her, she is a very good mother for me. [sn1,s] The Twentieth Week The End of The Emperor's New Clothes In my hildhood, I have read [vp6,5-2]  this story. Though many years have passed, I still remember the story. But my idea for [wd3,-] it is different [wd4,-2] that time. When I was only a little girl, I ought the honest boy was very kind, and he was as young as me, so I very [ad2,1-2]  liked himm [fm1,-]  I believed the emperor went back his palace,he knew himself was worng and regreted m2,-]. So he gave his place to the little boy and the boy became a good emperor. This was my beautiful hope for this story in my childhood. Now I became a student. I see and study the ings more than before. So my idea for this story has been changed [vp7,7-0]. Now I believe the emperor wanted to keep [cc3,1-2]  his face and held his head higher, then he couldn't see the road. [sn1,s] At last he didn't care and fell down. Because he had nothing on really, so [wd5,6-5]  the stone cut his skin. Sham was punish him[vp7,2-]. Though he tried his est to keep [cc3,1-2]  his face, but [wd5,9-4]  at last he couldn't. perhaps [fm1,-]  after many years, my idea will change. But I still believe the emperor was wrong. Because the story ells us: Fact must hit down sham [fm1,-]  [sn2,9-0]. 
  The New Term 
The First Week. On Saturday, I went to my grandmother's home after the school was over. When I got there, I saw my little sister whom I haven't seen [vp6,8-3]  so long time[pp2,2-]. She is only two. How [wd3,0-5]  a little and lively girl! I like her very much. When I saw her to play [vp5, 5-2]  a toy, I thought [vp2,1-5]  my childhood, and my toys. Though I didn't have so many at that time, I still played so happy [wd2,4-0]. And I often played games with my good friends. At that time, I usually stayed at home with Dad and Mum in the evening that I couldn't play with[wd4,-] friends. So I like the night of power cut [wd3,7-0]. In this evening, I could leave my home to play the game of "1/2??2?" and "TT1/4"... How [wd3,0-3]  a happy night! I needn't [vp9,1-1]  worried, needn't do home work ... Now, my childhood was [vp7,2-1]  passed. What is near me is not the toys, but the books and the school bag . I doesn't like [vp3,2-0]  the night of power cut [wd7,9-0] , because I must go over the homework.My little friends are the same as me, they must study. [sn1,s] .. but I doesn't [vp3,1-2]  feel unhappy. My parents work hard for me, they give me many things, including my happy childhood, without them I have nothing. [sn1,s]But [wd3,0-11]  a person in the world, he can't always take from others, he ought to give to others and his country. [sn1,s]If I do it, I must study hard now, though I can't play as before, I still happy [,2-0] , because I study for my duty. 
  The Second Week

 Xuan Yun sheng and me is [vp3,5-5]  a pair of good friends. We have got to know for seven years. Though some years were [vp7,3-1]  passed, our friendship didn't change. The feeling what [pr5,2-8]she gives me is very kind [cc4,8-] and clever. She has a pair of big eyes, and a big and high nose. She tells me her nose likes her Dad [wd7,7-0]. Her hair is often plaited on the[wd4,-], I believe this fits her. [sn1,s] She isn't very beautiful, but is very little. I often smile and say to her: " Brother, (We call each other: Brother) your face is young for ever, it doesn't grow old. [sn1,s]" Xuan Yun sheng likes smiling, sports, reading, listening to the songs, watching TV, sleeping (she often say [vp3,2-2]  to me: " Brother, I really want to go to bed!") and ... and helping others. She is a good monitor in our class, and she is a good friend to me. I will care [vp1,2-1]  her and study her. The Third Week What matter is paid attention to the most recently is President is elected in Taiwan [,14-0]. The result of electing is Li Denghui of the Nation Party winning. [sn8,s] Through [fm1,-]  I'm a student, I still know Li Denghui is a schemer. He wants to prove that he gets wide support through this electing, then he can make China has no way for him and he will be free to keep TaiWan as a country.[sn8,s] But he is wrong. Out country even doesn't afraid of America and Japan, of course, we don't afraid of him [,15-0].  China won't change the Chinese people's hope. If we are right, we don't change our idea forever. Tai Wang is China's territory, Li Denghui doesn't obey this fact, even begs America and Japan to help him. [sn1,s]This likes a man begs others to hit his brother [,9-0]. What a cheap man! I have still remebered: Four years ago, when Li Denghui was elected President the first, he told all the people that he would try to help to unite China and Tai Wan [fm2,-]. But now, his deeds is different,what he have [vp3,2-3]  ever said "completely, What a big lie!  " through[fm1-] Li Deng hui is elected President, the fact hasn't changed, China must be unite! [sn1,s] 
  The Footh [fm1,-]  Week
 I became to like to kick the huttlecock recently. In fact, I had [vp6,3-7]  liked it when I was a pupil.At that time, I often played with my classmates, and even with mum. I have taken [vp6,2-10]  part in the match of kicking shuttlecock in my school.  When I went into the middle school, the studing [fm1,-]  was ore difficult than before, and the homework was more and more. f I was free, I would rather watch TV, Because I usually have a little spare time to watch TV [sn2,10-0]. Then after a long ime, I didn't grasp how to kick the shuttlecock [cc6,-1]nearly. But when I studied in the senior school, I found the boys of my class are [vp6,7-4]  good at icking shuttlecock. When I see they kick so happy [wd2,6-0] , I can't help rying. So I buy a shuttlecock and kick with the girls. The girls in my class look like shy very much, but when they are playing, they won't shy [wd1,2-0]. They told my that they liked to kick shuttlecock as me before. Kick [vp4,0-10]  shuttlecock after the class was ver is a good thing. It can make us happy and light, and it is helpful for our riendship.I like it very much. The Sixth Week. The League members in our grade will go to?1 omorrow. I want to make a paper flower this night, it is for expressing the words of my heart. [sn1,s] When I make it, I think the struggle of Guang Zhou [fm2,-]  on 12. 11. 1927. A lot of soldiers lost their lives for our country and people on that day.how [fm3,-]  great they are! Now the?? ??is very wide and beautiful. But it is the place where struggled sharply sixty-nine years ago. There were many soldiers lost their lives at there.[sn8,s] The earth was dyed red by the soldiers blood. As the person of Guang Zhou [fm2,-] , I must remember this history.[sn8,s]Our happy living is changed by the great soldiers' flesh and blood[sn8,3-]. Without them we have nothing. So we can't take the good conditions for granted. We must care our happy living[wd3,-]. The paper flower is finished, I will put it in front of the "??1" and wish the soldiers who were buried were silent to " sleep" forever.[sn8,s] The Seventh Week. The Footprint One day, Robinson Crusoe walked along the sands towards his boat. On the way, he saw the mark of a man's foot. 'Is it a savage?' Crusoe thought. He was terrified by the footmark. And so he hurried home---the cave. When he thought [vp2,2-2]  the footmark, he was afraid to go out, even for food. He stayed in his cave for some days, but no savages came, and he became to feel more lonely without friends, because his dog was dead. So he decided to go back and look if the footmark was made by himself. But the foot print wasn't his. So there must be somebody else on the island. Then he decided to look for a cave where he could hide if savages came. When he found a good place and stepped into it, suddenly he saw two eyes glaring at him. He hurried out to hit a strick [fm1,-]. Now he stepped back into the cave and found it was an old sick goat. One morning, Crusoe found nine savages on the shore, they sat round a fire and ate something. [sn1,s]After they went by two canoes, Crusoe found the bones which the savages ate were a man's. Then Crusoe made up his mind to shout[wd3,-] the savages if they came again. 
  The Tenth Week 
My house has a " garden in the air". There are any flowers in it. they [fm3,-]  are planted by my dad. I like them very much. When you go into in [wd4,1-1]early morning, you will feel the air is very fresh. After watering the flowers [sn3,3-8] , some drops of water slide follow the flowers [, 7-0]. In the sun, it looks like some crystals. That is beautiful [cc6,-2]very much. In the wind, leaves shake slightly. And looks like to say "Good morning" to you.[sn8,s] When you breathe the flesh air, look at the plants and do some sports in the morning, how happy it [pr3,19-1]is! The "garden in the air" gives me much interest and tells me much knowledge about plants. Example: How to plant flowers? How to manage them? When do they bloom ... [sn9,-]And it tells me the important thing is not to pluck flowers and take good care of them. [sn8,s] 
 The Fourteenth Week
 THE STORY OF WELLIAM TELL. Many years ago, Switzerland was ruled by Austria. The hunter William Tell was same [sn8,-3]  the other Swiss, not taking[sn8,-4] his fate lying down. One day, William Tell came to Altorf with his son. He saw that a pole was placed in the marketplace. He knew what had happened: The governor who was sent by the emperor of Austria, placed his hat on the pole and ordered the Altorfers to bow before it. but [fm3,-]  William Tell walked past the pole without bowing. So his son and he were caught [wd3,2-3]  to the governor Gessler. Gessler thought out a cruel plan in order to punish them. He ordered Tell shoot [vp5,3-2]  at the apple which was on his son's head. Without saying a word, William Tell drew two arrows and splited [fm2,-]  the apple in half with one arrow.    How brave! And his son was brave, too. If the arrow shoot [vp8, 3-5]  at him,he wouldn't bow. Facing the emperor, William Tell and his son were calm and brave.Their courage [cc2,1-5]  quickly got round througout Switzerland. The Swiss were [vp7,2-1]  encourage, they rose up and forced the Austrain soldiers to go from Switzerland. [sn1,s] 
 My First Teacher. 
My first teacher, who taught me in the Primary school [sn2,9-0]. We called her Miss Le. Though she was the "first", I almost forgot her. Because she didn't teach me so long and she was a very common teacher [sn2,13-0]. It said [vp7,1-7]  that she went to foreign country later, so I haven't seen her for a long time. I only remember a little thing about her: She was thirty-five years at that time. She was from the north of China, but she could speak the language of Guang Zhou [cc6,-2]very much. She taught Chinese, and the classes which she gave [cc3,4-3]  were not interesting. But I still remember a small thing about us clearly; one day, Miss Le checked our homework. I didn't finish for playing. At that time, I was in Grade One, still a little child. But Miss Le didn't think about this. Then she let me stay in classroom after school over [wd5, 2-0]. I cried, but I must obey her. After I did the homework for ten times, she let me go home. I was first punish [vp7,3-0] , I will remember forever. [sn1,s]Because it made me know: I wasn't a little child, I was a pupil, I must study hard [sn2, 17-0]. I can't forget this thing, so I didn't forget my first teacher completely. 
 One Morning 
In The Summer Holiday. One morning in the summer holiday, I woke up early. But the sun has rised [fm2,-]  up. My bedroom became bright. I didn't went [vp6,2-0]  to sleep again. Then I got up and go [vp6,5-4]  out of the balcony. The balcony was covered by the sunlight. The morning sunlight made me feel comfortable. In front of the building which I live [wd4,7-4]  is a big tree. I thought that many little birds in it[sn8,s-]. though [fm3,-]  I didn't see one, I heard the voice that the birds was singing [cc3,8-0]. Their voice was not so good, but this was happy for me. The wind blowed [fm2,-]  at me, oh! So cool [sn2,1-0] ! Perhaps only in the morning, summer doesn't make us feel hot. Because I usually go to school, so [wd5,6-7]  I seldom feel such a good morning. Then I must thank [vp1,2-4]  for the summer holiday! The sun rise [vp3,2-4]  up higher and higher. The street was [wd5,1-2]  became busy. Many people went to work in a hurry. Morning is a new beginning. Though I am in summer holiday, shouldn't I miss a new start? OH! A new start----Let us care[wd3,-] it together! 
 My Grandpa. 
My grandpa is eight [wd3,2-3]  three years old. He is thin [cc6,-2]very much. But his health is good. because he gets up and does morning exercises at five o'clock every morning [sn2,12-0].Though he is old, his mind is still clear. If someone don't [vp3,2-4]  know my grandpa's ge, they [pr3,8-9]  can't guess that he is such an old man. My grandpa often smile [vp3,3-0], especially when we go to see him. He likes reading. He often tells me some great men, the custom of some places and the [wd5,1-3]  other interesting things. Sometimes he tells me his past to teach me the truth of living. My grandpa care [vp2,2-4]  my studying very much. But he seldom asks me the mark of the exam. He said to me: " The important thing is that you really grasp [cc3,2-2]  the knowledge." So he not only gives me some advice about how to treat (??y) the studying correctly, but also collects some articles about the ways of studying to me[sn8,s-].In fact,my grandpa is only a common old man. But he is my mum's daddy and he is kind to me. So in my heart, he isn't a common man. 
Ideal 
Ideal, perhaps everyone has one. Because it is important for everyone [sn2,5-0]. But when I was in my childhood, I wasn't clear what was [wd1,4-2]  my ideal. In my heart, the good thing was too much [np8,4-0] , I didn't know what was the best.[sn1,s] when I saw a doctor, I thought that doctor could save many lives, so I wanted to be doctor [np6,4-0]. When I saw the PLA man, I thought that he was so honour for defending our country, so I wanted to be..... I seldom thought about the deal after I became a student. But what I see and think is more than before. Our society isn't perfect like my hope. One day, I uddenly thought I must be a judge or a reporter. As a judge, she can defend the fairness[wd3,-]. As a reporter, she can report "the illness" of the society. Perhaps this is my ideal. But I really want to realize it. Ideal mustn't be great[wd7,-]. But it must be helpful for our society and people. My ideal isn't great, but I still try to realize it. 
THE NEW TERM THE THREETH WEEK 
Today is my grandpa and grandma's birthday. Their birthday is in [wd3,3-3]  the same day. my [fm3,-] grandpa is just elder [wd3,-]than my grandma for [pp1,-]ten years. Today all my uncles, antys [fm1,-] , [wd4,7-5] cousins went to my grandpa's home. They were happy, but the best[wd3,-] were my grandpa and my grandma. Looking at the children of own [wd4,5-0] , weren't they happy? I haven't seen them for some time because of the busy studying. I felt sorry to [wd3,3-1]  them. They missed me very much, and often asked my mother how I live and study [vp6,8-0]. Today, when I wanted to explain that I was very busy, they said to me: "Dan dan, to our joy the best, not you come to see us constantly, but you study hard and get a good school report." " I must do what you said." I answered with my heart, full of moving[wd3,-]. Though my grandpa and grandma didn't have [cc3,2-4]  a lot of knowledge, though they can't give me some advice on the studying,they have helped p6,21-0]  me --- give me support. Thank you very much, my grandpa and grandma.  I hope you get [wd3,3-3]  a good health forever! 
THE FOURTH WEEK 
Because National Day is coming, I have a holiday for four days. What will I do in these days? I don't want to only [ad1,4-11]  do the homework at home or go to bed all day, so I ceide[fm1,-] to do the sport in the morning. This morning I went to stadium shich [fm1,-]is near my house with my friends in [wd3,0-2]  6:45. Though it was early, many people have come [vp6,7-4]  here to do exercise. Look, a group of old women are dancing, fans in hand. How young they are!   Look, on the grass there are some children of not more than ten ,[sn8,s] they are playing a plastics football. How little they are! Running [vp6,0-8]  800 metres, we played a game of badminton. Perhaps we haven't played it for a long time, so we played it badly at first. But after some time, we played so good [ad2,3-0]  and we were exciting [aj4,2-2]  very much. An hour passed. Tired as we were, we didn't ant to stop. Why? Perhaps because of the good weather, the green trees, the kind old women, the little children and the good holiday. Perhaps we didn't for what , only for our happy feeling.[sn8,s]A altogether, everything were [vp3,1-1]  beautiful and everything make [vp3, 1-0]  us happy. What a happy [cc4,2-3]  sport it was! What a beautiful morning it was! We love the sport, the morning and our living [wd3,8-0]. 
THE FIFTH WEEK 
There are lots of things which made me move in my living. [sn8,s]For example, my parents encourage me when I feel sad, my friends help me when I am in trouble, and so on.[sn1,s] though [fm3,-]  the things are small, they can give strength to a person who is in trouble. I still remember it happened in [pp1,-]last two years:  One day I had a high fever suddenly [ad1,5-3]  in the school. I hadn't a little strength to do everything [pr6,7-0] , and I almost lay [wd3,2-1]  down. At that time, my good friend, a nice girl supported me and took me to a hospital. She didn't leave until the doctor finished seeing me. It was eight in the evening. We have not had supper, and I felt terrible [vp6,8-0]. When I wanted to cry, my friend said to me: " Insist on! insist on ! let's go home." Looking at her, I knew that she was tried [vp7,2-2]  very much, the same as me. [sn8,s]I was encouraged and I gathered the strength to walk... Though it was a small thing or a short word, I must thank it for giving me strength. 
 THE SIXTH WEEK
 

Our school takes the sports meeting every year, have had it for several years [sn2,6-0]. [sn1,s] But every time there was something that made me moving. In this week, all the students of our class were busy for [wd3,8-4]  preparing the sports meeting. Who were busy the most were the seventeen boys and girls [,10-0]. They epresented[fm1,-] our class to 3?3?.[sn8,s] This was a good chance. These girls and boys took care [cc3,-]3of this chance very much. We could see: In the class of P.E. after the school over [wd5,3-0] , in the evening studing of our own, they practiced [wd2,1-3]  on the playground. And they buyed [fm2,-]  the shirts themselves in order that they can wear [vp6,13-3]  the same clothes to 3?3?. Oh! They tried their best for our class's success. All the students of our class must thank [vp1, 7-2]  of them. 
 THE SEVENTH WEEK 
 I read [vp6,1-7]  a story about loving our homeland recently: During the course of the war of rising up[wd7,10-0] the Japanese.  Ji Hong chang (1/4ao* ) has been asked [vp6,5-3]  to visit America by the1*  * 3. At that time, in West people's eyes, China was a bad race.      Then some chinese [fm3,-]  felt themselves inferior (?) because of this. One day, Ji Hong chang went to a post office with his friend. When the postmaster knew that they were chinese [fm3,-] ,he sneered: "China? I don't know China. Where is it? Ha ha..." Ji Hong chang's friend felt him inferior and said to him: " Why did you said [vp6,3-4]  you were a Chinese? You should say you were a Japanese, then you can get the foreigner's respect." Hearing these words, Ji Hong chang turned red with anger at once.  He catched [fm2,-]  his friend's shirt and shouted: " Don't you think it is a disgrace as a Chinese? But I think it is a proud [wd2,5-7]  that I am a Chinese. I will not be a slave of foreigner forever!" Soon he went home and took a piece of wood, and wrote some things on it: I am a Chinese. Then he put it in front of his chest, and went to the street holding his head high. 
THE EIGHTH WEEK 
Today is Friday. It is the same as usual days: We must go to school. But our new teachers will leave us today. Our two new teachers are so young, and they are nice [cc6,-2]very much. Though they stayed with us only three weeks, they have made friends with us. They are Chinese teachers. But they taught not only Chinese but also the truth about living to us. They are good teachers. The lessons which they taught were interesting and we were interested especially. After the class, they played with us. We regarded them as our friends. Today they will leave us. I can't write my words to express my idea. But I know: though we maybe [ad1,1-5]  will not meet each other, I will remember them and the time that we stayed [wd3,8-2]  together forever. 
 THE NENETH WEEK 
"Hello, It's Huang Xiao dan. Who is that?" "Hello, It's Xuan Yun shen." "What's the matter?" I asked. "Oh, no matter. [sn8,s]I only want to talk with you. Are you free now?" Xuan Yun sheng said. " I'm doing homework now. But since you want to talk with me, then I give some face to you [sn8,6-0] ." I answered. "That's great. I went shopping with my mum last night. We saw two men fright [wd3,4-0]. Can you guess what have happened?" she asked. "A thief stole the eople's wallet?" I guessed. "Oh, no. The reason why they fought was a man knocked [vp2,2-3]  the other's shoulder. only [fm3,-]  for this, they quarreled at first, then they didn't give in, at last they fought." She said. "Oh, ..." I wondered : Weren't the two men fools? In Guang Zhou, which is a beautiful and modern city, there are some people such as these, they really made us disappointed very much. [sn1,s] 
THE ELEVENTH WEEK. I like sports, all kinds of sports are insteresting [fm1,-]to me. [sn1,s]But it is swimming and table tennis that I like the best. In summer, when I jump into a pool, I feel very cool and happy. his is one of the reasons which [pr5,6-3]  I like swimming. The other is that my mum told me swimming can [vp6,6-5]  make us stronger and taller. Swimming not only makes us happy but also does good to our bodies. Can't I like it? [vp9,3-]I not only like to play table tennis but also watch table tennis match. Table tennis match is very exciting. It gives me [cc3,-1]relaxation. When I watch a table tennis match, I feel proud. Because the Chinese sports often win the match [sn2,7-0]. I like Wang Tao and Deng Ya ping very much. I like the [wd5,2-2]  other sports, for example: basketball, football, volleyball and o on, they all can keep us healthy. [sn1,s] 
THE TWELFTH WEEK. 
The teacher of biology told us: If we felt bad, we should do the other things, in order that we could forget the unhappy things. I agree [vp2,1-2]  her words. Because I often do so [sn2,4-0]. When I am unhappy, I will choose sleeping first. And eating is a good was [wd7,5-3]  for me, too. Because I needn't think of anything in sleeping [sn2,7-0]. After sleeping [sn3,1-10] , though I can't forget all things, my feeling becomes quietly, my train of thought become clear.[sn1,s] At that time I can know what has happened and what I should do. This was [vp6,s-]  is often useful, except [wd4,0-8] sometimes I can't manage the matter at all. Eating is a way as useful as sleeping. But it does a little harm to my health, so I rather choose sleeping. When I eat, I feel that I can do what I want to do. How joyful it is! At this time, I can forget the unhappy things. Sleeping and eating are the good was[wd7,6-15]  for forgeting [fm1,-]the unhappy things, but the best was is trying to make myself happy, not angrying[wd2,-] for a small thing. 
 THE THIRTEENTH WEEK. 
THE PROFESSOR AND HIS INVERNTION[fm1,-]. Professor Hunter was very excited that morning because he had just finished the papers of his invention. And he was going to give his invention to the two men from the goverment[fm1,-], in order that everyone would be able to benefit from it. but [fm3,-]  two impostors shut the two men from the goverment[fm1,-] and came to the professor's house to take away the invention. They pretended [vp1,1-2]  very well, and they believed that nobody could recognize them. So after they got the invention, they didn't think whither the invention was right or wrong. They thought that they had been success [wd2,6-0] ! But the old professor was more clever [aj3,1-0]  than the two impostors. The invention which he gave them was the others papers. Because he recognized that they were not the right men from government [sn2,11-0]. So when the other people were worrying about the invention, the professor was relaxing. Because his invention was still on his desk! [sn9,-]  [sn2,7-0] 
THE FOURTEENTH WEEK 
I got ill this week. The illness and the medicine made me sad. And I always wanted to sleep and had no energy in studying. Sometimes I really wanted to put my heart into the exercises very much, but I couldn't. At this time, I wish that I had had a good health. And only when I was ill, did I know the health was important and sports was of great value. But I often forget this. n spare time, I'd rather watch TV, listen to the songs, read books or go to sleep. Now I unstand[fm1,-]that the health is the base [wd3,-]of studying or working. he exam of this term will come soon, I must take care of myself to build a good body and full confidence. [sn1,s] 
My Winter Holiday 
The winter holiday, [sn5,s]I always imagined it was relaxing and wonderful. I has planed [fm2,-]  where I would [vp6,7-10]  go to play with my friends and how I spent every day. I enjoyed myself when I thought [vp2,2-1]  this, even in the exam. But when the winter holiday came really, I found my idea was impossible. Because my winter holiday was too short, it only had 11 days. And I had a lot of things that must be done. Such as: doing housework, doing home work, going over the text...Though these things weren't so wonderful, they brought me a valuable winter holiday. In facts [np2,1-0] , they gave me much interesting [wd2,4-0] :when I saw the windows that were washed, I felt so happy. Though it was a small thing, I could help my mum. when I finished my homework, I felt satisfied. Because I didn't lose the time in watching TV all day [sn2,10-0].Oh, I almost forgot a thing.That was, I has planned to finish reading three world famous works. Now I has finished two. I decided to read the last one. But in fact, I couldn't understand them so well. 
 An Interesting Story

 Today, I read an interesting story, it was talked[wd5,-] about: A young man had a new girl friend. [sn1,s] In order to impress her, the young man invited his girl friend to go to a world-famous restaurant one evening. They had a very good supper, and they danced until midnight. How wonderful this evening was! They enjoyed themselves very much. But at last, the waiter brought the bill to the young man. When the young man saw how much he had to pay, his face turned [wd4, -2] white as a paper. The waiter saw this, he thought the young man might faint, so he quickly brought a glass of ice-cold water and emptied over the young man's head [sn2,6-]. Then he took the bill back and added to : ' Ice water: 50P'  though it is an interesting story, it is instructive to me. I have learned the texts"The Lost Necklace" and "The Emperor's New Clothes". These tests have the same meaning as this interesting story. That is : we shouldn't care much for honor and money. If we do, the bad result will belong to us. We must be honest. The Spring Festival. To children, the most happy [aj3,2-0]  day in a year is the Spring Festival. I like the Spring Festival very much. But the reason why I like it is not the same as before. In my childhood, I wondered why the Spring Festival was so special and all the people were different as usual[wd7,-].  But it didn't matter. I would forget this question soon. Because there were so many things which made me happy [sn2,9-0]. For example: the beautiful new clothes, lots of suger, the flowers in all kinds of colors, the? ?, the interesting game with my little friends... In my eyes, all the things were perfect. How I wished the time could stop at that moment! Now I am sixteen, not as[wd5,-] a little girl. I still like the Spring Festival. Because I can visit my relatives and talk with them [sn2,9-0]. I like the feeling when I stay with them. How warm the feeling is! We are often busy and have no time to visit each other [sn6,11-0]. So we are this special day very much. To Chinese, reunion is an important thing. 
 My Father 
 In my childhood, I was afraid of my father. Because I seldom saw him smile [sn2,5-0]. When I grow up, I unstand [fm1,-]my father is strict with me. Perhaps he thinks I am not a child and I can unstand [fm1-][cc3,2-2]  many thinks[fm1,-],he talks with me more than before. [sn1,s] Through our talking, I know him a lot and I was afraid of him no longer. In fact, my father like [vp3,2-1]  smiling. Sometimes he says[wd3,-] the joke to us. His joke is not so interesting,but he still smiles louder than us. He like [vp3,1-2]  writing poems. When he was young, his poems were often published.But as his daughter, I don't like this at all. Why? Otherwise, my Chinese maybe [ad1,2-4]  is very good now. Like many fathers, my father can repair lots of things,for example: light, washing-machine, radio, bicycle... He is espected for this by my mother and I [pr4,4-0]. This is my father, he is only a common man. [sn1,s] But in my heart, he is great.But in his heart,what he beleives me [,7-0] ? On Duty. It was [vp6,1-8]  our turn to be on duty this week. it wasn't [vp6,1-3]  the first time. But this time had some thing different from the last time.[sn8,s] Why? Because our school is being built now [sn2,6-0]. So there are a lot of holes in the ground. And there are many leaves falling into them. Cleaning the ground was our duty. So we must pick up these yellow leaves. It was a hard and troublesome work [np5,4-0]. But all of us never mind. Though the yellow leaves were wet and dirty we tried o pick up every one. In our heart, we believe our chool is very beautiful. Though there are a lot of bricks and earth on the ground. It is still beautiful. Because a modern high building will stand here soon [sn2,8-0]. I think that we needn't do the cleaning so tiresome [wd2,-]at that time. 
  The Air Garden 
There is an air garden on my house. But I haven't gone [wd3,2-5]  to it for some time. Because I was busy very much [sn2,5-0]. Every day I must leave home in the morning and come back in the evening. If I have spare time, I would rather stay at home and o some reading. Today I suddenly wanted to go to the air garden. So I did. Ah! Only two weeks![sn9,-] Our air garden has changed a lot. There were so many yellow leaves on the ground two weeks ago. Everything looked like sleeping. Today, any kinds of plants have come up. The color of the small shoots is light green. They are soft. On the other hand, some plants have bloomed. The colors of the flowers are very beautiful. There are red, yellow, white, light red and light green. All the things are new and soft. You must be comfortable when you come into this green place. So I was.[vp6,-]The feeling which the nature gives for is new [cc4,9-]and happy. I love such feeling as this. I love the nature, for I can forget all the trouble in it. 
  Take Good Care Of My Eyes 
 We had a medical examination this Saturday. I couldn't be calm until this Saturday. Because I always worried about my eyes [sn2,6-0]. My eyesight is not so good. I must wear a pair of glass [np6,3-0]  when I have class. I can't see the whiteboard so well without the glass [np6,9-0]. But I didn't pay attention to this. I still didn't do the eye exercise, and still put my head low when I did my homewoek[fm1,-]. So when I knew the examination was coming, I worried that my eyesight would be found worse than before through the examination. That would be a bad news for my parents and me. I said to myself: 'If I pass the examination, I will take good care of my eyes.' At last, the report of examination told me that my eyesight was the same as before. How excited I felt at that time! But at the same time, I found most of my classmates' eyesight was not so good. they [fm3,-]  must wear the glass [np6,3-0] , too. his was a bad thing. Were we too hard at study? I decide to take good care of my eyes. I hope my classmates are the same as me. I hope that I needn't worry about my eyesight in the next medical examination. 
 A group of English students will visit our school. So the eadmaster gives me a report about the English students' action, and let me tell them what they will do in the coming days. So I introduce that. In [wd3,0-2]  Monday morning our headmaster will meet them and will introuduce our school' condition. In the afternoon they will be invited to visit the scientific building and the library. On Tuesday they will visit the Great Wall with our school students. Mr Zhang will tell us the interesting thing about the Great Wall. In the evening, we will take a party in the room [fm3,-]  402.  On wensday [fm1,-]  we will have a meeting. We can talk about the experience and ideas of the study with each other. On Thursday they will leave for Xi An by train at 9:45. Learning How To Ride Bike. I was eager to grasp how to ride bike[np7,1-]. So my dad decided to teach me. From then on, he taught me after he went home every day. though [fm3,-]  I often got a heavy fall, I ill learn [vp6,8-3]  by my heart. I didn't stop learning. So two weeks later, I could ride bike without my dad's help. One day, I first rided [fm2,-]  the bike following my father on the street. I was much careful and I said to myself from time to time:' Take it easy! Take it easy'. I will succeed! My dad always noticed me, but he didn't help me when I was in trouble. He only said to me that I should look ahead in stead of looking at the bike. At last, we went home safely. My dad praised me and I was excited very much. I succeeded! My mum smiled and asked me if I was so worried just now. I pretended to be calm and said "no". but my father said: 'A lying girl. But I was worried more than you.'
 April 26th. 
 "Hello! It's Huang Xiao dan speaking. Who it it[wd6,-]?"[sn2,s] " Hello! It's Xuan Yun sheng." "What's the matte [fm1,-] ?" I asked. "Oh, no matter [np1,1-]. I only want to talk with you. Are you free now?" she said. "I'm doing homework now. But since you want to talk with me, I will give [cc3,-2]some face to you. " I smiled and answered. "That's great! I went shopping with my mum last night. We saw two men fright [wd3,4-0]. Can you guess what has appened?" she asked. "Ah, I often see and hear these things. Did a thief steal a man's wallet?" I guessed. " Oh, no. why they fought was a man knocking the other's shoulder [sn8,s]. only [fm3,-]for this, [sn5,s]they quarrelled at first, then they didn't give in. [sn1,s]at[fm3,-] last they fought." She said. " Oh..." I wondered: weren't [fm3,-]the two men foolish? In Grangzhou [fm1,-]which is a beautiful modern city, there are some people like these. They really make all the Guang zhou's people disappointed very much. May. 6th. I'm doing my homework at this moment. But I'm thinking about another thing --- the three holidays which has just passed. Our study is hard and we are often busy. So I thought my holidays would be relaxing and wonderful at first. But in fact I didn't feel happy in these days. For what? Because --- because I have done a wrong thing [sn2,8-0]. My mum's heart was sad. And how I regretted [wd2,-]at that time! I should not have done the wrong thing. Why not think it over before I did it?now [fm3,-]  perhaps my mum has forgotten this thing. She loves me deeply. I'm sure that she will pardon me. But I can't pay off what I have done. I can't pardon myself in [wd3,4-2]  some time. It is no use regretting what has been done now. So I know what I can do is treat [vp6,8-3]  my mother well. I decide trying [vp5,2-5]  my best to do it, and I will not make her sad any longer. 

 May 12th. 
Our headmaster Wang died. He lelf [fm1,-]us forever! When I heard his bad news, my heart [cc2,-1]sang. I couldn't imagine that he left this world so fast. All the people said that he devoted himself to our school's development and he was respected by the teachers and students. I knew this. But what he impressed upon me wasn't this. In my heart I always thought he was a very kind man as if he wouldn't scold his students. I remembered he had given a talk to us on a meeting about the problem two years before [wd3,2-0]. Finishing his talk, he went and sat down near me. He asked us how we studied and if we would continue studying in the NO.4 Middle School. How kindly he said! He only asked and collected our ideas, and he didn't order us to do anything. At last he encouraged us and wished us would get a very good result.[sn8,s]At that time I was thinking that he was like our friend more than our headmaster. All the things have passed. It only remains some memory. But this is enough to encourage us studying hard. 
My New School 
Being a new student, I went to my new school and felt excited. When I came into the school, I felt the air was special[wd3,-1] fresh. Because my new school was large very much, and there were many big trees around it [sn2,15-0]. My school had [vp6,2-0]  three high buildings. One was for our experiments, the other two were for our having classes. [sn1,s]Though my school had [vp6,1-4]  thirty-six classes and there [wd5,1-3]  a wide playground [sn2,16-0]. It was very valuable for students to develop their body [np6,3-0]. Look! There were some students playing basketball on it. Seeing all the things, I could imagine how wonderful were [wd1,5-7]  the following days which I would have. n fact, I always took pride in my new school. Because it was a key school and it had a history of seventy years [sn2,13-0]. It said [vp7,1-12]  that there were many famous men and women graduating in my school. So I thought that the teachers must be very good and they were strict with their students. Since there were such good teachers, the students must be clever and respect their teachers. 
My New School
 My new school is a key school which has a history of 70 years. There were many famous men and women graduating from my school. My new school is beautiful and big. There are so many big trees around it. It has two teaching buildings, one lab building and a big playground on which some students are doing exercises. That [pr2,0-6]  is valuable for students to develop their bodies. Now my school has thirty six [fm2,-]  classes, one thousand eight hundred [fm2,-]  students and two hundred teachers. In my new school, the teachers are very good and strict with us. So we respect them. 
 Dear Peter: We're so glad you're coming to join us on Sunday. Here is how you can find us. When you come into the gate of the People's Park, you may go down the rode[fm1,-]  which is near a small river. So a few minutes later, you well find [vp6,2-5]  a bridge over the river. Crossing the bridge, you should turn to the right, and you can see a small hill which is not far away. Then you keep on going towards it. When you reach the foot of the small hill, you should turn [wd3,s-] over the hill. After doing that, you can see a small woods [np6,2-0] , then, we will wait [vp2,2-4]  on you in it. 
 June, 14    Sunny 
It is nearly thirty centigrade this afternoon.  So hot the day is! [sn9,-] I see that there are about seven to eight children swimming in the river. They are mostly good at swimming. Look! A little girl is learning how to swim with her mother's help. I like swimming, too. I used to swim in my childhood. I still remember the last time that [pr5,6-7]  I swam was about ten years ago. At that time I was spending my holiday in Beijing. The days in June are very hot, but I like them. I believe that June is one of the best months in a year. 
Our Monitor 
Our monitor's name is Zhang Wei hua. He is seventeen. He is not only our monitor but also the head of our school's football team. He is one point seven three meters high and seventy kilogram [np6,1-0]. He is fond of music and is goot [fm1,-]  at sports. So he is strong very much [sn8,s-]. As a league member, he respects teachers and often helps us when we are in trouble. He is active to join our school's actions. [sn9, -]What a good league member he is!

A piece of advice 
I think everyone in our class wants to improve your [pr3,7-1]  lesson. But how to do is a problem. Now, I'll tell [cc3,1-5] you a piece of advice. A piece of advice on how to improve you [pr4,3-1]lesson is "Make notes ". "Make notes" is different to "Take notes." For example, in English class, teacher [np6,0-2]always writes some important things in [wd3,4-1]  blackbord. [np7,1-]We must "Take notes". But we must also "Make notes". What the teacher said is more important than those on the blackbord. I hope everyone "Make notes", but not "Take notes".
 Please keep the school clean. It was [vp6,1-7]  a month since the new term began. We clean the school every week, but I always find[cc3,-1] dirty in some place. I think it must be make [vp7,5-3]  by few [np8,7-1]  students. we [fm3,-]  must look on our school as our home, and make it clean. It is easy for us to do it. Pay attention yourself. Don't throw the waste on the floor, throw it into the dustbin. [sn1,s]I think some time later, our school will turn clean. Also you can think if we don't do that, the rubbish will do harm to our health. Let us try our best to keep our school clean. 
 Guang Zhou's [fm2,-]  weather 
 Guang zhou's weather always changes. Do you agree with me? I think some say "yes" and some say "no". beg [fm3,-]you to hear my explain. [sn8,s]I think everyone have [vp3,1-4]  the same to [wd3,3-] me. For example, the day you went out, the weather was good, the sun was shinning, you enjoyed it very much. [sn1,s]But when some time had ted[fm1,-],[sn8,s]the weather changed quickly. the [fm3,-]sun had hidden, just a moment, it was raining hard. [sn1,s] How disppointed [fm1,-] you are! Perhaps the worst think [fm1,-]to you was[wd4,-] you forgot to take a raincoat.Ha Ha! How foolish you re! I'm sure you will think when you go out in Guang Zhou [fm2,-]  in summer, the worth [cc4,-1]thing is to take a raincoat. 
 The sport's spirit 
The NO.4 middle school's sport meeting [cc2,6-2]  has past [wd2,5-0]. But in the meeting, I found the ports spirit. I didn't know him, but his spirit deeply marked n my heart. I still remembered the thing. At that time, he joined the running of 1500 metre [np6,3-0]. The weather is hot and the sun is shining [vp6,8-0].After 800 metre's running, he was so tired that he couldn't keep the high peed. By and by he as left to the end. His sweat droped down. He wiped the sweat away and went on running. Suddenly he felt [wd3,2-4]  down on the ground. All the people were shouting at him and encouraged [sn6,8-0]  him. He didn't give up. He did what he could to raise himself.  Finally he raise [vp6,2-4]  up and continued running. Everyone claped their  [pr3,2-1]  hands. However he was the last to the end, but he just like [wd7,11-2]  the winner. His spirit had already in everyone's heart.[sn8,s] 
 I and my book 
 I like reading book, because it tells [cc3,6-3]  me some knowledge and also tells [cc3,0-3]  me some advice. I like reading book [np6,3-2]  about science. The book about science can tell me the strange thing I don't know. The book just like windows, I can look though [fm1,-]it and look around the would[fm1,-]. [sn1,s]The book is also like a teacher. It often gives me some advice on how to learn the object such as English, maths, chinese  [fm3,-]... Not only these but also [sn6,4-14]it gives me advice on how to do good deed, how to help others. From the book, I have learn  [cc3,2-4]  [vp6,2-2]  some knowledge. Do you like reading books?

Last week I was walking in the street. Suddenly I heard a voice : " Hi, How are you?" I stopped and turned around. Oh, it is my old classmate. Xiao jie is [vp6,2-8]  my classmate when I was in Primary [fm3,-]  school. Now he isn't my classmate, but I still remember him. We are the [wd5,2-6]  good friend [np6,4-0]  in school. After [cj1,0-2]  say "Hello", he told me is past and told me his new school, new friend, new thing. I let him to my home [,5-0]  and invited him to have dinner. In the afternoon, he left.

You can see them in some place, such as in the classroom and even in [wd3,2-2]  the road, they are doing some studying now. [sn1,s]How diligent they are! After class, you can always see some of them still in the classroom, doing exeicies [fm1,-]or quarreling at [wd3,2-1]  something. We will also try hard and try to do the best. because we think we are always the best [sn2,7-0]. 
 Autumn's trip 
This autumn we went to Xie chao Hill for the trip.  Last Saturday, the weather was good, the sun was shining. [sn1,s]When we reached Xie Chao Hill, we couldn't held [wd3,2-1] crying. How beautiful Xie Chao Hill is! The hill and the lake were green, they looked nice. [sn1,s] We held a high breath, the wind was so cool that we were feld very good. [sn1,s] we walked alone [fm1,-] the road and heard some bird crying sometimes. After a walk, we arrived at a place where it looked like a park, there had [wd3,1-2]  some store [np6,1-0]  and we did some shopping  [sn2,22-0]. We were [wd5,1-3]  enjoyed this trip, and we had a good time. 
 Clock 
I have a clock. He is my good friend. He has a round face. On it there has [wd3,3-3]  a beautiful picture. He has three hands which move around day and night. So he is so busy all the time. He can [vp9,1-1]  rang, when the morning comes, he well [vp6,1-5]  ranging and wakes me up. [sn1,s]He just like [vp3,2-1]  shouting: "The sun rises up, you must get up. [sn1,s] " Sometimes when I look at the clock, I always think: " the clock doesn't feel tired, he still working [vp6,2-1]  quietly. [sn1,s] His spirit is worth studying. He is just like a model. Professor Hunter was very excited that morning, because he had completed the papers of his new invention which everyone would benefited [vp9,2-2]  from it. he decided to give it to the government. Two government [wd3,1-5]  would come for the papers. But at half past ten, two impostor [np6,1-0]  came for the papers. The professor didn't trust them and gave them some wrong papers. After some time, the police came and told the professor that the two men were impostor [np6,4-0]. To he police surprise, the professor said it was not necessary, because the papers he gave them were wrong, [sn9,-]he still got the papers on his invention. 
 English. 
 English is the most important language in the world. We must try our best to improve it. Many country [np6,1-0]  speaks [vp3,4-1]  English and look on English as their mother language. When we are in other country, you [pr3,6-3]  will find that English is useful. You must speak English and only English can make people understand. English is also useful in our country. When you see the foreigner, you can say hello to him and also when you do besines [fm1,-]  with other country, you must speak English. English is the language that many country [np6,1-0]  uses [vp3,3-1]  it  [sn5,8-0]. we must work hard at English. 
  Computer. 
 Computer is a modern machine. In 1946, an american [fm3,-]  professor whose name was John W. Mauchly invented the first computer. Computer improves quickly. today, many families have a computer, and new computer is more smaller [aj3,1-0]  than the first one. Computer can do much [np8,0-1]  things such as doing business, shopping, relaxation and so on. computer [fm3,-]  can also do much [np8,0-1]  things that people can't do so that it is very useful for me, for us and for all the people. Computer will have deep effect on my life. 
 A new year. 1997 will come in three days. Now, I wish everyone happy new year. In the new year, I will do best than the last [sn4,6-0]. [sn1,s] I'm a student so I will try hard in my lesson. In 1997, we will have five subject's [np4,1-1]  exams. It is important for us to do it better. The exams have deep effect on my life. Everyone in our class wants to collage[wd2,-][fm1,-] after school[wd3,s-], so in 1997, we must try hard. I think it is easy to say but hard to do. But I also think e will do it better than last, because we're always the best. 
 The Spring Festival
 The spring Festival is the important day in China. When it comes, people begin going shopping and doing cleaning. On that day, people get up early and put on their new clothes. The younger greet the older. The older give " lucky money" to the younger. They visit each other and their friends. During these days, people all enjoy themselves. 
 We ought to learn from Lei fen [fm1,-]  . This month is a memorable month. In this month, we ought to learn from our model --- comrade [fm3,-]  Lei fen [fm1,-]. Lei fen [fm1,-]  was a good man. He had given [vp6,2-11]  all he had to our Party, our country and our people. He tried to serve [vp1,1-3]  for the people, doing what he could to help others. When you are [vp6, 2-10]  in trouble, he always put his heard [fm1,-]  in helping you. As it known  [vp7,2-2]  to all, Lei fen [fm1,-]  is our model. We must always learm [fm1,-]  from Lei fen [fm1,-]. His spirit will  [vp9,2-4]  always in my mind. I will never forget him. Spring Spring is comming [fm1,-]. When the weather turns warm, [wd4,s-] when everything comes up, spring is comming [fm1,-]. Walking in the street, you will see all the thing [np6,2-0]  have great [cc6,-1]changed. New shoots of tree comes [vp3,4-3]  up from the stem. All shoots are green when you see them, you will feel [wd4,-]natural. The wind is comming [fm1,-]toward you and brush your face [sn6,13-0]. The shoot sways in the wind. It looks like some one is shaking hands with you. The sun is shinning [fm1,-],giving all shoots energy to the earth,[sn8,s]and [sn6,13-6] the hold world turns very warm. Our biology teacher When we talk to [wd3,3-15]  our biology teacher--- Miss Yu, everyone in our class will sing highly for her teaching. In our biology class, we are not absent minded, we listen carefully and take some note. [sn1,s] Miss Yu always lets us into the sea which has [cc3,1-2]  much knowledge [,13-0]. She often gives us many example [np6,1-0] in lesson and we enjoy the things very much. By and by, we love biology. Poor knowledge as we have [cc3,4-0] , we always have some question in many kind f biology, she tries her best to explain to us. [sn1,s]Miss Yu is a ood teacher, she leads s to succeed. [sn1,s] 
Pollution 
When you are walking in the street, you'll feel terrible. This only because of the poisonous gases [sn2,6-0]. In the street, cares [fm1,-]  run on. At the end of the car, the poisonous gases are given off. The poisonous included CO, SO2, O2 and so on. Million [np6,0-4]  of tons of waste and porsonous [fm1,-]gases are sent into the air with the smoke. These do harm to our life. Scientists try to find ideas to do with the gases. [sn8,s]For example, Don't permit cars sent out the gases, plant more tree. [sn1,s] I think all the things must be done by the people. Everyone must try his best to change it by himself. 
 Raining[wd3,-]day. 
 The weather in Guang zhou in spring turns [wd3,-]quickly. the sun shines in the morning, but it is a heavy rain in the afternoon. When it rains, it is trouble [wd2,-]for everyone to take an umbrella. Because of the heavy rain, the street is so wet that everyone have [vp3,1-3]to walk carefully than [sn4,13-1]ever.  After raining [sn3,1-6] , the street turns cleaner and cleaner. The weather is cool and you will feel well. The sun appears in the sky and the street turns warmmer [fm1,-]and warmmer [fm1,-]. School's singer. " The school's singer [np6,2-7]  will have a atch in a week." It was [vp6,1-10]  an interesting thing for all the students in our class. There were four students in our class joined the match [,9-0]. We all wished them succeed. The four players tried their best to improve their voice so that they could get the good result. At the day when he match began [sn2,6-0]. They all put their heard [fm1,-]  into t. everyone sang high praise for them. Finally, Xu Wei feng on the match and he could join the final match. We wish him succeed in the end. 
 A chess match. 
There will be a chess match in a month. It is an interesting thing that this match is between a man and a compter [fm1,-]. This man had [vp6,2-5]  won more than ten time [np6,3-0]. But this time, he is challonged [fm1,-]  by a computer. The computer is made by IBM company. It can work millions of times in a second. How far [wd3,10-2]  it is! You can suppose that the match will [vp9,2-7]  much [sn4,7-4]  exciting than everyone else. I think this match is not only a chess match but also a match between a man and a machine. Computer is made by a man, it can do more work than a man. [sn1,s]But without command, it can do nothing. So a man is much clever than computer. The man will win the match at last. 
 Zhu jiang River Pollution. 
When your [pr4,1-5]  walk along the Zhujiang River, you will smell a terrible gas from the River. This will o harm to our life. I think you may have a question: why the river turned dirty. This because of the thing what the people had done [sn2,9-0].You can see someone throw waist thing to the river sometimes. When time pasted [wd2,2-0] , there are some rublish [fm1,-]on the river.   The water turns black and tastes bad. So we must try our best to keep the river clean, not throwing anything to the river, only we do it, the river be able [vp9,3-2]  turned dear. [sn1,s]  The table tennis's world cup. In this month, there is a table tennis match in Britain. Many country [np6,1-0]  send their sporters[fm2,-] to join this match. I think this match must [vp9,4-4]  very interesting and citing. Our country's sporters are good at this game, so every sporter [fm2,-]wants to win the match. But they must be challenged by sporters[fm2,-] who is [vp3,3-3]  in other country. As we all knew, last time our team got all golden [wd4,4-0]. This team will try their best to succeed a second time. Everyone in our country wishes our team succeed [sn8,s-]again. 
Basketball playground 
Last week, a new basketball playground completed [vp7,4-0]. How exciting [aj4,1-2]  we are! But in this week, there are some problems let out [,9-0]. Every day at 7 o'clock, when one reach [vp3,2-1]  school, many students has [vp3,2-5] played games on the playgroune [fm1,-]. At 7 o'clock P.M. many students still played [vp6,3-1]  game in [wd3,4-2]  the playground. I think playing basketball is good to our health, but playing for a long time is harm to our health. Many students played basketball, forgeting [fm1,-]to have dinner or supper. It is harm to our stomach [np6,1-0]. I think we must play in a [cc4,2-1] fit time. 

 My New School 
 Our school is a key school. It has a history of over seventy years. After graduation, many students became a famous man [np6,5-0]. Now our school has thirty-six classes, 1800 students and more than 200 teachers and workers in our school [sn8,s-]. Our school is big and beautiful. Around the school there are many trees. The school has two buildings for teaching, one building for doing experiments. There is a big playground where many students have sport exercises on [wd5, 11-1]it. The teachers in our school are excellent. The students loved [vp6,2-4]there school and teachers.[sn8,s] A basketball match. Last week we had a basketball match. It was an exciting match. This time our class VS class Four [sn2,6-0]. The students in class [fm3,-] Four are good at sport. They also good at basketball [,4-0]. They are taller than our class [sn4,5-0]  and their technology of basketball is stronger than us sn4,7-0].So when the match began, they played at high speed x,9-0]. The sponter [np6,1-5]  [fm1,-]  of our class try their best to prevent the class to get [vp5,4-1]  mark. When they get a mark, everyone in our class hit their hand together [wd7,12-0] . At last, class [fm3,-] Four won the match. In fact, our class played well. 
 June 14        hot[fm3,-] 
 How hot today is! In the afternoon, the tempiture[fm1,-] almost reached 30C. This afternoon, when I was walking along the river, I saw seven or eight children swimming in the river. In [wd3,0-6]  them, some were good at swimming. As I seeing [vp6,2-0] , I noticed a little girl was learning swimming, the one who teached [fm2,-]  her was her mother. [sn1,s]Seeing this, I couldn't help thinging [fm1,-]  about my younth[fm1,-] [fm1,-]. I used to swim in my childhood. I also remembered [vp6,2-7]  my last swimming was ten years before [wd3,6-0]. At that time, I was spending my holiday in Beijing. I regarded June as a good month for swimming.

THE SPORT I LIKE BEST 
The sport I like best is to play table tennis and badminton. How joyful to have a game of table tennis or badminton after a day of study at school [, 17-0]. It can make us relaxing. It is great value [np1,1-]for us to play table tennis or badminton after school. Playing table tennis or badminton can build our bodies, prevent from getting too fat, and keep us healthy, give us valuable practice in helping the eyes, brain and muscles to work together. Another, [sn2,s]playing table tennis and badminton are also very useful for character-training. It is help[wd2,-] to study. 
Speaker's Selection 
There is a speaker's selection in our school. Many students take part in it. Luo Qing Jun and Ye Tia ing also sign up. The selection way will [vp7,3-2]  be change. There will be plentys [fm1,-]  of prizes. The winner will be given the prizes. I think it will be colourful. In fact, the speaker's selection is a great valuable amusement or us. For example, it can increase [cc3,2-2]  our knowledge, improve our expressing power and thinking power. I hope more and more students are able to take part in it. 
 THE PROFESSOR AND HIS INVENTION 
 Professor Hunter was very excited that morning because he had just finished the papers of his invention. And he was going to give his invention to the country. He decided to take his papers to London himself, but the trip was too much for him. So there would be two men come for the papers [,9-0]. But at half past ten, There were two impostor [np6,1-0]  came for the papers. Professor was so clever and careful. He didn't give the real papers to them. He only gave them some papers put behind some books on the shelf[sn8,s] , and they left in a hurry. Shortly after that, there were two policemen came [vp4,-]for the case's information, but the professor said that it was necessary to catch the impostor. Then he explained it to the policemen. At last, he decided to take the papers to London himself. 
 WHEN WE LEAN ENGLISH WE MUST DO AS AN ENGLISHMAN 
When we learn English we must do as an Englishman. First, we cannot speak English with our language order [sn8,s-]. For example, we can speak [wd3,2-8]  "I like it very much" but cannot speak " I very like it", we can speak " I write the letters with a pen" [wd4,-]cannot speak "I use a pen to write the letters". [sn1,s]So we must do as an Englishman when we are learning English, and speak English in English order. How to speak English with right order? We should read English aloud every morning as possible [pp2,6-0] , which helps to train the language sence [fm1,-]. And tell story with our language, because it can force us develop our mouth muscle [,14-0]. 
MY FIRST DANCING 
This week we had [vp6,3-6]  gone all out to practise dancing that was my first dancing. I had never joined [vp6,3-14]  in the Art Festival of school since I studied in N0. 4 Middle school [fm3,-].But this year I have to take part in it for our class. We didn't go home after school so that we may [vp6,9-5]  have more time to pratise[fm1,-]. Although we are all hard we think it is very valuable, so we have no murmur. [sn8,s]  I believe that we will secceed [fm1,-]by the effort. [sn8,s] THE ART FESTIVAL OF SCHOOL FINALS 
This Saturday, the Art Festival of school had [vp6,7-5]  been on in Peilei Theatry [fm1,-]. We are all excited and happy. This time I am one of the actors so I am special [wd2,2-1]  excited. The finals was [vp3,2-3]  rich and wonderful. The ardent applause sounded again and again. The viewers[wd3,-] were very warm hearted [fm2,-]. This finals is [vp3,2-5]  much better than last year [sn4,9-0]. For example, the student's fashion show and the recital with dancing have never appeared, these have great characterisic. [sn1,s]There are three performance programmes [sn9,-]one gets three class and the other two get second class. [sn1,s] 
My Winter Holiday 
My Winter holiday is rich and colorful. The first is the Spring Festival and "Yuan [fm1,-]  shao [fm1,-] " Festival. The other is to receive lots of money for " Li shi", it is I like best. [sn1,s] The spring Festival is not only the beginning of a year but also the social intercourse time. People give the presents to each other and greet each other. We say [cc3,1-6]  some congratulations to bless each other. We are enjoying ourselves. The " Yuang [fm1,-]  shao [fm1,-] " Festival is a day for family and for those people who [wd5,4-2]  in love. We eat "Tang Yuan" together at home. The Tang Yuan" is sweet and our hearts are also sweet. But it is a pity that we are not permitted to fire the Smoking Flower. Whether it is permitted that must be oven more colourful.[sn8,s] 
 The Spring Festival 
The Spring Festival is coming! All over he city is filled with the happy atmosphere. The people are smiling. uses[wd3,-], cars, bicks [fm1,-]  and many people go up and down the street. The voices of the them sound like a song. People have a habit of going to the Flowers [fm3,-]  Market [fm3,-]. It is said that people who have one around the Flowers [fm3,-]  Market [fm3,-]  will change their lucks. So people ill go to the Flowers Market at the end of the year. Although it is raining, people still go to the Flowers Market as before. The lowers Market get [vp3,3-5]  more beautiful and more [wd6,9-1]  beautiful. All kinds of flowers compete each other. The big oranges, roses, chrysanthemums are taking a bath in the rain. They seem very attractive. [wd4,0-10]The first day of the year, almost people [wd4,1-3]  go to temples. [wd4,0-15] The second day of the year, almost [wd4,0-9]  people pay a visit to their friends or relatives. It is the most[wd7,-s] thing to get together with family. The plan of a year is made in Spring. People will full heart of hopes to meet the new year! [sn9,-][sn8,s] 
  The cripples also can live a happy life in the Spring Festival. The office of the street has launched a movement to help the cripples live a happy life in the Spring Festival. They call on the residents to give some money to help the cripples. Of corse the residents are glade [fm1,-]  to help them. The street officials get the money together to buy some gift [np6,3-0]  to [wd3,13-2]  the cripples. The street officials borrow serveral[fm1,-] wheelchairs from hospital, they take the cripples to the Flowers Market with them. [sn1,s]The cripples are all great happy and thankful. They shake hands with the officials tremulously and can't keep back their tears. Such is the socialist society! The knowledges[np5,-] exchange. Each country cannot exist lonely. He must in exchange for other countries [,6-0]. Expecially[fm1,-]the knowledges[np5m-] exchange [sn2,3-0]. Hong Kong is coming back [wd4,5-1] the homeland. The knowledges [np5,1-0]  of Guang zhou and Hong Kong are both rich and interesting. We should study each other. I think we should change the rule for education. Students should learn [cc3,2-1]knowledges[np5,-] about the practical[wd4,-]. And what we have learned can be used in practical [wd2,9-0]. I think what we have learned are [vp3,6-1]  useless. Some of them are uninteresting. For example, Hong Kong's students are learning the practical English, such as the letters for job, reports, and so on. although we have never learned these [sn2,5-0]. Whether [wd3,0-9]  someone asks us to write a letter for job, then how can we do. [sn9,-] So it is necessary to study each other and change our old rules for education. 
 The first failing [wd2,-]in English
 Last week we had [vp6,3-8]  had the first English exam in this term. I greatly regretted that I had failed in the exam. I had never failed in the English exam since my learning English. But this time I had [vp6,4-1]  failed. The 56.5 being written on the paper, I can't believe in my eyes. I thought I was sorry to Miss Lin and myself. Why did I fail in the exam? Because I had paid no attention to going over the lessons [sn2,10-0]. In the future, I will try my best to improve my English and get high marks in the each exam! [sn9,-] 
Be careful of the fire 
Last week, a great fire was [vp7,3-2]  broken out in the Weng chang Road. he main reason is that when a child was playing the TV game [sn2,12-0]. he wires were suddenly shortcut. The wires were heated, the tempereture[fm1,-] was so high that a fire could [vp9,2-2]  broke out. [sn1,s] The fire soon spread through the while [fm1,-]  house and the neighbours'. There was a man died of the fire [,7-0]. The fire give  [vp3,2-5]  people a lesson: be careful of the fire. Pay attention to reading. Reading is important to us, xpecially[fm1,-] the English learner [np6,8-0]. There are two sorts of reading. One is to read aloud, the other is to read the compositions. [sn1,s] Miss Lin had once said in class that reading helped to train language sense. There will be a hearing test in the examination. So we should pay more attention to reading. Stone-Cliz has aid that what you had read. What you can hear [sn2, 13-0]. If you want to get high marks in the examination you should pay attentino[fm1,-] to reading,including reading aloud and reading compositions. English Corner. 
Sunday, I looked through the English weekly. It said that there was an English corner in Shi chuang Cang Xi xian ong hang zheng middle school, every Wednesday afternoon, a free talk in English is held in the reading room after class. [sn1,s]A good many students from different classes and grades attend it. they talk talk [wd6,2-5]  about all kinds of things in English just like old friends. I envy it very much. Though there is also an English corner in Zhong shan library, it is far away. I wish there will e an English Corner in our school reading room before long. 
 Our School's Education Examination.

We were in harmony with teacher and [sn6,6-4]  completed the teaching duty. At last, the leaders thought highly of our school, and hoped that our school will [vp6,5-7]  make even more progress in the future. Li Ming felt [cc3,-2]great difficult to learn English at first [pr2, 9-0]. His teacher had greatly encouraged him and helped him. He worked hard, and often asked the teacher [wd4,3-8] some advice on how to learn a foreign language. Before long he had [vp6,3-3] made rapid progress and was praised by his teacher. Now he can write a letter in English, but he still feels it is limited, and he decides that he will try his best to improve his English.  I'm glade to hear from you and be your pen pal.

They are very strick [fm1,-]  with students. students can have classes and do experiment in the laboratory. Many students are interested in biology. After class, they can come here to do experiment. With the teachers' help, they have learned many useful things. I live in a small town with long history. The small town has a population of two million. It lies near a river, which is at the foot of hills. There are flowers, grass and trees here and there. It's very beautiful. Since 1980, great changes have taken place in the small town. Many buildings are put up, and a hospital, two schools are also built. The town takes on a new look so I love the my town and the people.

You can choose the topic freely, but each one can't speak over ten minutes. Just the students of Senior Two [sn2,5-0]. It is a good chance for you. Don't miss the chance! 
 You must sign up in the No.303 classroom before this Saturday, and before the fifth winer[fm1,-] will gain the prize, an English-Chinese dictionary each, I hope. You will take an active in it and become the winer[fm1,-]! 
 My new school. 
My new school is a key school with a history of seventy [wd4,4-0]. It has two teaching building [np6,2-0] , a lab building and a big playground, in [wd3,4-6]  which students take part in sports. It is large and surrounded with trees. It's very beautiful. There are thirty-six classrooms. One thousand eight hundred students and over two hundred teachers in it [sn2,11-0].all the teachers are excellent and strict with students. stundents [fm1,-]show respects to their teachers. Now many students who graduated from the school have become famous people. So I even like my new school, and make up my mind to study hard and reward [vp1,0-3]  to my teachers. 
 Today is my birthday. In the morning my parents and I went shopping. Mother bought me a toy doll and a pair of new shoes as my birthday present. I liked them very much. Then we went to [wd4,0-2] North sea Park to go boating, where we had played [vp6,15-3] nearly two hours. At noon, we had a good lunch in a restaurant. We had a good time. 
 June the fourteenth. Today I saw seven-eight children swimming in the river. Most of them were good player [np6,5-0]. A little girl was learning swimming, and her mother taught her. I often went [vp2,0-2]  to swimming in my childhood. When I spent my holiday in Beijing in [wd5,2-3]  ten years ago, I went [vp2,1-2]  to swimming for the last time. I thought June was the best months on a year. I like football very much. I often play football after school. I'm team [np7,-]leader on [wd3,2-3]  the school team. Our team had [vp6,2-5]  failed in the last game. But we do not take [cc5,-4]our fate lying down. Our teacher has us train hard. Our team to be sure win in nest game [sn2,8-0].

The spirit of candles 
One candle likes [wd2,2-4] very small and ordinary. But its spirit is really great. In the dark, it burns itself, so that it can light all of us. The light of a andle is as important as a sunbeam. ur teachers are like the candles. They spent their life in teaching us. If we leave the teacher, we will have [cc3,2-2]  no knowledge, become [wd4, 7-2]  very silly, as if a man who can not see. Candles always don't get their pay from the people, and the teachers give up their life to education. Their pirit is the same, and we thank them just the same, too. 
 An elephant and a judge. 
This is an interesting story which happened in England in 1994. There was a football match between Arsenal and Chelsea. When the watch was going to begin [sn2,6-0] . Suddenly, an elephant walked into the stadium, and stood in the middle of the ground. People were all in surprise. At that time, the elephant played with one football, using its long nose. One man came near the elephant. He handed a stick, which was Hanging[vp7,s-] bananas. He put up the stick, so that the elephant could see the bananas, and he could tempt it to leave. But the elephant didn't be interested [vp2,4-3]  in the bananas, and went on playing with the ball. After a moment, the man brought a basket, which filled [vp7,3-7]  with apples, pears, mangoes, tomatoes and oranges. This time, he didn't succeed again. Then, a group of man came. They tried their best to push the elephant. But it was big and heavy, nothing could make it to move a little. [sn1,s]At last, a judge came. He watched the elephant playing the ball for minutes. Then he thought, " The elephant must be interested in football. Maybe it knows the rules, too". he judge took out a red card to the elephant. To everyone's surprise, the elephant immediately put away the ball, and walk [vp6,8-3]  away the ground. The judge smiled and announced the match was beginning. 
 Love our class 
Recently, my classmate Feng Yu jing goes to school early in the morning. Does he do so in order to get more time to study? No. On fact [np2,1-0] , to practise running, a long run, on the playground [sn2,12-0]. The sports meeting will begin this Friday. Feng Yuying will take part in 1,500 metres running. Now, he is active in practice. It shows that he deeply hopes to be the best, to win for our class. Everyone in the class must love it from his heart, must consider it as important as his life, and serve it whenever [wd3,3-0]. Feng Yu Ying is very good, all of us should learn from him. [sn1,s]Football in our Class. Many boys in our class liked [vp6,5-4]  football since Senior 1. They not only often played football inside and outside the school. But also watched a football match on TV on holiday [,20-0]. Very much as many boys liked it, our class football team was not the best one in four classes. At that time, Liang Jian ling was a leader, that is to say, he was the captain of our class football team. But he did not lead the team to get the champion. This made everybody sad. No one scolded them, because they had done their best, defeat looked reasonable. [sn1,s] Now, football in our class has good chance to develop.[cc4,-3]. Su Wei jie's coming makes everyone very joyful, particularly is [wd5,9-3]  Liang Jian ling. we [fm3,-]all believe tomorrow will be better. Before long, there will be a football match between Class Four and our class. On that day, victory is ours. 
 Why He Didn't Finish Homework 
To[pp2,-2] our surprised, Liang Jian ling didn't finish the homework twice this week. and it was the nglish homework that he did not finish. But, it was impossible hat he did so in order to make our headteacher angry. Then why he did so [sn2,4-0]. I wanted to know. I thought and thought, and at last I found out a reason to explain. Because his other name is " BEAR'' [sn2,5-0]. As we know from the fifth lesson, bear is a beast which half-hibernates. So as soon as the winter comes, "bear" will become very luzy[fm1-], this is reasonable. [sn1,s]I hope this article can make Liang Jian ling " wake up", and make others joy. 
 Particular Friends. 
 Today, two practical [cc4,1-1]  teachers are going back to their school. It has passed four weeks since we knew each other. On these days, we get on well. we usually study, talk together, and even play games together. Because they are as old as us nearly [ad1,6-0] , we regard them as friends more than teachers. The majority of the class like them very much. Today, we have to say good- bye to them. Before leaving, they give us a perfect football. Because they know we all like playing football [sn2,7-0].We will look on the football as an expensive present and keep it well. let's remember these two particular [cc4,1-1]  friends for ever. 
 The Main Idea of " Zhu Fu" 
We learned a text calls [vp4,4-4]  "Zhu Fu" days ago. It was a novel which was written by Lu Xun, the famous writer. The main character in this novel was Xiang Lin Sao. She was a working wowan [fm1,-]  who was ppressed before liberation. After her husband had died, Xiang Lin Sao [fm3,-] didn't take her fate lying down.[sn8,s] She fled. She went to Lu Town, and worked for a landlord. Because she was not lazy, the owner liked her. But not long later, her husband's mother sent two men to kidnap her back. She was forced to remarry and then [sn6,6-5]  had a son. Two years later, her second husband died, her only son was eaten by the wolves. [sn1,s] Xiang Lin Sao went to Lu Town again. But some one laughed at her and the owner drove her out. She became a beggar, and she believed in spirits. She looked frightful. At last, she died before new year... How wretched she was! From now on, we should more [ad1,1-1]  love  [cc3,3-2]  our living, [wd4,10-1] study harder. 
 Collective Cohesion . 
our[fm3,-]class is an excellent upward collective. But the blemish in an otherwise perfect thing is it lacks cohesion. Once, the head teacher asked us, " Who is willing to carry the mud from the botanical garden?" no one answered. Till the head teacher promised she would give reward to the students who is [vp3,8-7]  willing to do it in moral education, some one tried to be the first to do. How weird! Collective belong [vp3,1-4]  to all of us. Why we haggle over every ounce in serving it? [sn8,s] Some students in our class come from the other class. We permit they miss the old one, and we absolutely don't permit they look on the new one --- our class as an inn. They must regard our class as their permanent destianation[fm1,-]. On the other hand, we make a statement: we welcome everyone to join our class, so long as they [pr3, 10-6]  love this collective in the heart, willingly and gladly serve it. otherwise [fm3,-]they are persona non grata. Collective cohesion is very important to us. Having it, we would o on progressing. 
 Electioneering 
 This Monday, our head teacher announced that one electioneering about class cadres would be held next week. this would be a majoy[fm1,-] event in our class's democratic life. The class cadres have not been changed in general since our new head teacher assumed office. Some of them discharged their duty all along, but a handful of them was in office only in name . to [fm3,-]our class, such a special collective, having a group of competent cadres is very important. I hope this electioneering [fm1,-]will be successful. The elected cadres must have served all the classmates, led our class to be flourishing[wd3,-]. 
 Retell the Play. 

 Professor Hunter was very excited that morning because he had just finished the papers of his invention. And he was going to give his invention to the government. But he wasn't strong enough to go to London himself. So the government sent two men to take the papers. The men would come at eleven. Only at half past ten, two men came. They claimed to be sent by the government. They looked too nervous and were too anxious to leave. Professor Hunter was very careful in important things. He distrusted the two men. So he gave another papers to them, not the true one. They accepted, and left in a hurry. When it was eleven o'clock, the police telephoned that the right men who came from London had been kidnaped [fm1,-]on their way to Professor Hunter's house. That is to say, the two men who came a moment ago were impostors. Before long, inspector White and Sergeant Bull came to investigate. To [pp2,-2] everyone's surprised, Professor Hunter said that it was not necessary to catch that two men. He explained that the papers that two men had taken was [vp3,10-2]  not important... At last, Professor Hunter decided to take the real papers to London himself. 
 Letter of Accusation. constitution [fm3,-][pr1,-]stipulates: "Citizen enjoys criticism, proposal, petition, complaint and accusation right [np6,8-0]." Now , I'm going to exercise the right of accusation.  The week before last, when I wanted to add a note about football to the back blackboard, the propagandist unexpectedly extorted one yuan from me for this. Because he was a bureaucrat, I had to be extorted. The propagandist have [vp3,2-5]  already constituted [cc3,0-3]  the blackmail crime. On the other hand, when the propagandist published stumping [wd3,-1]speech, he said that he would propagate the football gratis. Now, he have [vp3,1-5]  gone back on his word, he have [vp3,1-0]  deceived us. [sn1,s] Though the money he extorted is little, the effect is very big.  All of us don't need such a class cadre. The head teacher must do something to punish the propagandist, in order to stop this kind of thing happening. f the head teacher were not to give me a reasonable answer or overrule this letter of accusation, I would complain to the school. At that time, the head teacher will also be a defendant. 
 Our P.E. teacher 
Our P.E. teacher calls [vp7,4-3]  " Long Sea, Thunder". He perhaps is in his twenties, but he looks as if he were about forty years old. hy? Because his face doesn't match his age. As he always speaks the common spoken Chinese, we all think that he is a man who comes from another province. That he is tall and powerful, also shows that he comes from the [wd5, 1-2]  North China. " He gets on well with others, [sn9,-] " our head teacher describes our P. E. teacher like this. Is it right on earth? Publish opinion will decide which is right and which is wrong. May our head teacher represent the public? The answer is clear. Objective fact can't be denied. Let us wait and see. All the students, love our P.E. teacher, please. I think you all can do that, because he is really lovely. Right?

 Innocent 
Our classmates are very innocent. They don't know here are many sinister men in the world. They over [wd7,1-6]  believe the people at our side, like the teachers who taught us before. In the preliminary contest of this Art Festival, several classmates, who took part in it, were deceived and betrayed. In singing song, three boys was active in practising before the preliminary contest. They even composed a ci peom [fm1,-]again. They thought, this must be the capital that they score a success. They also met Teacher Wu chun pei, one of the judges, in order to enter the finals without a hitch. Altogether, they thought they were able to enter the 90 per cent sure.[sn8,s] But the result was that they were betrayed by Wu Chunpei, they were sifted out. [sn1,s] In a short, we were deceived by the judges more obviously. We lost very wrongly. Our head teacher and we had thought that there could be four programs enter [vp4,5-2]  the finals. But now, only two. A all into the pit, a gain in your wit. Let us remember: depend more on ourselves, need no others' giving alms. Don't be too innocent. 
 Long long [wd6,-] ago, there was a famous prime minister in China. he called Wei zheng [vp7,3-0]. Once, he said to the king of the Tang Dynasty, " I hope you let me be a good subject, not a loyal subject." The king asked why he said so. Wei Zheng replied, [sn9,-]  " The good subject assists the monarch to administer a country, they get on well with each other, then the monarch will enjoy a good reputation. [sn1,s] the loyal subject is killed by the monarch, because he admonishes the monarch, then the monarch will get a bad reputation." [sn1,s]Miss in, I hope that you will enjoy a good reputation. I had ulterior motives to write to the vice-head teacher. Liang iang ling was taken advantage of. I expected that he would take the " etter" to you. I didn't write it only ask for help [,7-0]. nstead, I wrote it in order to remind you and all the classmates. Miss Lin, " good advice jars on the ear helps [wd4,6-4]  to do things better", do you know? I know, this " letter" has hurt you greatly, I have gone too far. [sn1,s] Here, I say sorry to you. At last, I wish you can make unremitting efforts to improve ourself, use your wisdom to lead us. Why I can succeed in this exam? I have succeed in this examination doubtless. Why can I do so? It is impossible that a student has not pressure [cc1,4-]  in the exam. Being a student in the emphasis class [cc4,1-0] , the pressure [cc3,1-5]  I have had is bigger. Some classmates even think that no pressure is no impetus. Altogether, the pressure comes from three ways: society, family and school. Especially is family [,2-0] , because the parents all hope their children will have a bright future. In this exam, my pressure comes from the teacher mainly. Before the exam, the head teacher had a talk with me. She demanded that I should set an example in study to all the boys who like playing football. From then on, I felt that I had weighty responsibility. The strong sense of responsibility drove me to study more harder[ad3,1-0].So the pressure the head teacher gave [cc3,5-5]  me helps me to victory. That is to say, I must tank [wd3,2-1]  her. 
 My Winter Holiday 
My winter holiday in 1997 bores me to tears. I have a bad opinion of it. I would rather go to school than have holidays. In these days, I have not a delightful holiday, but a tragic experience. My winter holiday is very brief, but it enough [ad1,1-3]  makes me busy. Innumerable holiday homeworks [np5,2-0] , preparing the coming new year, preparing the new term ... all of these must be done in thirteen days. How poor I am! Free and unrestrained living don't [vp3,4-5]  belong to me at all. Because the heavy study assignment ties me [sn2,6-0]. Even in the holidays,I am unable to extricate my self from it either. In short, my winter holiday is dull. I believe that all the classmates have the same opinion, only the teachers will feel happy in the holiday. [sn1,s] 
 The Spring Festival 
 Someone thinks that the Spring Festival is a festival for the children. So I don't get [vp2,2-4]  more interest in it as I grow up. I even find that with the passage of time, the festive air is not warm any more. But my parents still pay more attention to the Spring Festival. They buy many potted flowers to decorate our house, such as hyacinth, azalea, chrysanthemum, narcissus and winter daphne. Some of these flowers feel [cc2,4-1]  fragrant, others look very beautiful. [sn1,s] Because it is warm in the winter, the flowers bloom early. Fortunately my father thinks of a way to prevent the flowers from blooming early, so that they can keep pace with the Spring Festival. For example he put the narcissus which is going to bloom into the icebox. Though the Spring Festival is during my winter holiday, I can't be happy to my heart's content, because I have to hurry to do my holiday home works [np5,4-0]. God save me! 
  Piece of Good News 
On february [fm3,-]  the third, I saw a piece of good news in the Yang [fm2,-]  Cheng [fm2,-]  Evening Paper. In Tian jin, some teacher did what the students must do all day long; getting to school on time, having several lessons, and so on are the students' school living. though [fm3,-]  they needn't do homework, and needn't support the parents scold, the teachers still felt very tired and made their head swim. After copying the students' example, the teachers generally said that the students was [vp3,7-4]  really tired and suffering. They also said that the knowledge which the students taught [vp7,-] is dry [aj3,-2] as dust, and needed mechanical memorizing. Someone even said that if things go on like this, students aren't able to become talents who needs [vp7,7-5]  in twenty-first century. This is a piece of good news, because it can set people thinking, including teachers, parents and educational experts. And the students seem to keep silent temporarily, because they really have no alternative. 
 The Petrel Golgi ... The dark clouds get darker and darker, lower and lower, and press to the sea [sn6,14-0]. The waves are singing, at the same time, they are rushing to the sky, going to welcome the thunder [sn6,18-0]. The thunder roars. The waves shout in the form, ontending with the fierce wind. Look! The fierce wind hug [vp3,3-10]  layers of billow, and ferociously throw them to the cliff. The petrel is shouting and flying, like the black lighting. He flies across the dark clouds like an arrow. His wing shims over the waves. Look! He is dancing in the air, like a spirit --- a supercilious, thunderous spirit. He is laughing, and he is howling. He is laughing at the dark clouds. He is howling because of happiness. This sensitive spirit, early feels tired in the thunder. He believes that the dark clouds cannot cover the sun --- YES! CANNOT COVER.[sn8,s]The fierce wind is shouting. The thunder is roaring. The dark clouds, like the blue fire, are burning on the bottomless sea. The sea catches the lightning, and lets them [pr3,7-5]  go out in their abyss. These lightning's shadow, like the burning snakes, is swimming in the sea, soon disappears.[sn8,s] The storm! The storm is coming! This is the brave petrel. He is superciliously flying on the sea, in the lightning. This is a voice from the successful prophet: LET THE STORM COME MORE VIOLENTLY! 
  Confrontation. 
This week, the grade master have had a special talk with us. Ten days ago, we had a grade meeting. In the meeting, the grade master talked about how to manage the relation between boy students and girl students correctly. She hinted that young students cannot [vp6,5-4]  have a love affair. Though our grade master has really given much thought to the matter, some of my classmates do not agree with her. They are disgusted with what she said. On the other hand, the grade master is unhappy after she perceives this. So she thinks that it is very necessary to talk about this problem to us again. Last term, we ever troubled the grade master. At that time, we must hand in 65 yuan before travelling to Xi Qiao [fm2,-]  Hill. But some of us took a sceptical [fm1,-]attitude on handing in so much money. So the grand aster had to explain to us. In all fairness, our grade master care [vp3,3-4]  for us very much. But sometimes we would think that she's a busy body. So we intentionaly [fm1,-]trouble her, too. The "confrontation" between the grade master and us, [sn9,-] shows the universal contradiction between teachers and students. That is to say, this "confrontation" is normal.
Talk 
the [fm3,-]confrontation Again. In last week's English composition, chen zhi jie wrote an article to appraise what our grade master had done through discussion. He regarded the grade master as a tiger which [pr5,8-7]  didn't let boys or girls love together. His words were extreme, and the head master prevented him from continuing his article in time, but I found that some classmates thought highly of the article after they had read it. what did his [pr4,2-1]mean? Last term, Chen ever told me such a thing: The grade master had a talk with him for one sentence on the blackboard newspaper. She thought that Chen censured the school for doing injustice through that sentence. Chen was baffled. From then on, the relationship between the grade master and Chen turned bad. So it isn't strange that he regarded her as a tiger this time. I have not been for Chen all along, including this time. But, since so many classmates agree with him, one of our class cadres, I must remind the head teacher that something will be done by them before long. Remember, the world relongs [fm1,-]  to them and me. 
Tired 
It is at a quarter past six on Monday morning that I writer [wd2,1-2]  this arcticle[fm1,-]. Only five hours ago, I still did my homework in the lamplight. That is to say, I have been [vp6,2-8]  asleep for five hours in the past evening. In fact, on Saturday evening and Sunday day and night, I few[wd2,-]  stopped writing, few [wd3,-]left my house for a walk. I wrote and wrote, but it seems that the homework cannot be finished for ever. Since the new term began, the time that I spent on problems and home work was more than that I had a rest---the necessary rest.I always go to bed late at night, and get up much earlier than any [wd5,14-1]others. So I am very tired now. I don't know when the days like this will end. Perhaps no end [sn2,2-0]. After the unified state examination, something else must wait for me. I have to suffer hardships again... Now, it is a quarter to seven, I have to hurry to school with my weary body. 
Understand Each Other 
Why the students do not all agree with what their teacher said? Why do they sometimes get on badly with their teacher? I think it is because the students and their teacher have different opinions. For example, some boys like playing football, because they all think they can enjoy themselves from it. on [fm3,-]  the other hand, their teacher don't [vp3,2-4]  let them play football in most of their spare time. Because their teacher think [vp3,2-0]  that this will affect their study [sn2,9-0]. I think these two opinion [np6, 2-0]  are all  [pr6,6-1]  right. In fact, everyone must have his unique opinion. And his opinion cannot be changed easily. If one can't do these, it seems that he is a puppet. This kind of man who is easily manipulated by others is not useful. After either the students or their teacher knows this piece of reason, what they can only do is understand [vp4,6-2]  each other. One of them must think that he himself is reasonable, and others are right, too. 
  Harmful Slogan 
 There is a slogan that " We're always the BEST" on our class badge. It has done great harm to us. Such a slogan, like the opium, puzzled and poison [vp6,8-9]  some of our classmates since it came into being. From then on, we made few preparations for struggling. We believed that we were really the best and no one could triumph over us. We slacked off in our studies. In short, we have lost much because of this slogan. Though this slogan is seldom talked of by us now, it has already taken root among [wd3,5-3]  our hearts deeply. We must hurry to annul this slogan in order to let all of us realize ourselves correctly. When we do so, we are full of hope of success. 
 Streamline Administration. 
 Our class cadre is [vp6,3-2]  too many. When they have a meeting outside the classroom, they often make great noise. Because they sometimes have different ideas [sn2,5-0]. I dare not say that some cadres are unfit for their office. But s a public, I find that some of them are very at ordinary times [wd7,10-0]. They usually care more for themselves than for others. They are not arctive [fm1,-]  in helping the students whose study is not very good. [sn9,-]perhaps they think that their study will get bad if they do more work for the people. And it is clear that they find no good ways to manage the class. On the other hand, some of the cadres made [vp6,4-2]  mistakes recently. For example, the propagandist was ever scolded by the head teacher because of his extolling freedom of speech. This week, our monitor is also scolded for he plays basketball till night. The head teacher has to give a lot of care to manage the cadres. Here, I suggest streamlining administration. 
 My New Friend 
 Wu Zhi cong is my new friend. Both of us were born in the year of the monkey. He is the youngest boy in our class. Do you know why I made friends with him? Cong looks innocent and lively because he is young. At ordinary times, when I get along with other classmates, I find there is a strong smell of gun powder among us. Some of the classmates have already fought for the study in a terrible fix. The have already been the fighting machines. I believe Cong and I wouldn't be like them. Perhaps youth is our capital. We can deal with our study and daily life correctly. Getting along with him, I feel very happy. I also find that some of his characters is [vp3,4-2] as mine. So I decide to make friends with him. Wu Zhing cong is a clever fat boy, and I'm a boy who is full of worry. We must help each other. I wish our friendship will endure as the universe. 
 Homeland 
 The People's Republic of China lies in the east of Asia and to the west of the Pacific. Her area is nine million ix hundred thousand square kilometres. So our homeland is the largest country in the [wd5,7-1]  Asia, and one of the largest countries in the world. There are more than one point two billion people in our homeland. She's a unitary multi-national state. Her terrain is tall in the west and low in the east. The topography is complicated. Our country has rich minecals [fm1,-] , aquatic resources, natural forests and water power resources. Our homeland is very beautiful. As the time goes on, she gets stronger and stronger. Just then, the Chinese people can live and work in peace and contentment. Now, we are working hard for this object. Our homeland's tomorrow must be better. 
 Walk. 
On May the second, some of our classmates went to visit the Bai yun Hill. When they descended the hill, they choose [vp6,6-3]  a wrong way, o that they had to walk a long way. This made them went back home late and tired [,8-0]. After the event, the head teacher also admitted that she had never walked such a long way in her life. But she thought it is [vp3,4-2]  a challenge. Yes, her view is right. That is why I am glad to walk more than four kilometres to go to school each day. now [fm3,-] , I am good at walking even a very long way. In fact, when I am not happy, I will go out for a long walk. Wandering in the street, I will forget the unhappy matter. I can say in pride if I had walked the same way with those classmates that day, I would not feel [vp8,15-11]  tired, and I could urge them to walk faster and faster. But walking too long will do harm to us. It will cause the accident damage to us, like wound the ligament[fm1,-] and feet [sn2,13-0]. Let's go on walking, and every step leaves its print. Let's walk as fast as we can, so that we can pursue the sun --- the brilliantest [fm1,-]victory. But, don't choose the wrong way again. 
A Pair of Special Playing Cards. When I was in Senior one [fm3,-] , I often took photos of my classmates. For examply[fm1,-], even on the day when school opened, I took photos of them, in order to cause them to notice me. And after the photos were developed and printed, I would give the photos to each character [wd3,7-0].As three months were past, I had already taken photos of them three times, and I had gathered more than one hundred pictures. Then I chose fifty- four ones [pr6,5-2]  from them, and made these photos into a pair of playing cards. This pair of playing cards were very expensive. Altogether I spent more than ninty[fm1,-] yuan on them. They were also of great value--- commemorative value. I will keep this pair of special playing cards well for ever. Broken Arms In the last two weeks, several matters about basketball have [vp6,9-4]  happened in our class. It made our head teacher very angry that some classmates cared m ore for playing basketball than studying. But, does she notice that some of the class cadres are connected with these matters. [sn9,-]        First, on one Tuesday evening, some classmates even played basketball on the playground till half past nine. It was Feng Yu jing that took part in it, too. When they saw the head master coming, Feng fled the fastest on his bike. Finally, he has also been caught. Several days later, two cadres, Liang jia chao and Mai Zirui made the same mistake. It was more disgusting that they led some boys who don't [vp3,10-10]  belong to the No.4 Middle School into our school. These three cadres have already made self-criticisms facing the classmates. Since the cadres made the same mistake continuously, it is not strange that ordinary students wouldn't obey the rule. This must be said that " when those above behave unworthily[fm1,-], those below will do the same [pr2,15-0]." As we know, the class cadres are the arms of the head teacher's. Now, the arms are broken. This will do harm to the headmaster and all of us! Dear head teacher, LOOK OUT!
