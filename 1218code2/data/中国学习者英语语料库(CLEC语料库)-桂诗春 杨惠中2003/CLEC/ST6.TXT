<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> Euthanasia should be Legalized in China 	Euthanasia, or mercy killing, means helping to hasten the death of a person who is badly suffering. According to Joseph Fletcher, it includes people getting incurable dease [fm1,-] and people in a helpless condition, such as trapping in a blazing fire. [sn8,s] In China, suicide is legal, which means, people are legal to kill themselves in a helpless condition, so what we conside [fm1,-] is only whether it is legal to end the life of a [np7,1-] incurable patient. I am in favor of the legalization of euthanasia, though some others against it.[sn8,s]  	Those who against it agues [fm1,-] that euthanasia is inhumane. It is a false argument. Death, most of the time, is the end of long suffering period. With the advanced medical techinique [fm1,-] and equipment, human life can be extended. On one hand, it is in deed a good thing to provide people health when the diseases are curable; on the other hand, it is rather a bad thing to extend people's suffering when the diseases are incurable. In addition, medical treatment for the patient with incurable disease is extremely expensive, which is a heavy burden to the patient's family. To take care of a badly ill and irritating a patient is a hard job, [sn8,s] which is also time-assuming. Since there is no hope of recovering, and both the patient and his or her family are suffering, it is by no means a humane thing to extend their suffering. Those who want to extend other's suffering just for the sake of the ease of their conscience is selfish and unpractical. [sn8,s] Those who against it also afraid that some people will abuse it, such as to murder.[sn8,s] Their worry is well justified for such possibility does in deed exist, but it can be prevented by taking measures, such as , not allowing to utilize euthanasia until thorough examination is made, having approval of the patient himself, requiring the patient's family members to fomally [fm1,-] write an application, and having joint approval of all medical personnel attending the case. Nothing is perfect, we should not refuse to eat for fear of choking. that [fm3,-]is , we should not extend other's suffering just because an unpleasant possibility, and such possibility can be well avoided as long as we take enough measures.  	There are two forms of euthanasia. The first one is voluntary, that is chosen by the patient. When one choose [vp3,2-] to die, it is because to him, death is more attractive than being alive, usually is under the condition of great suffering. A servey [fm1,-] of 200 old people shows that 92 persent [fm1,-] choose to die with dignity and peace, instead of agony and degradation. In this case, an injection of sedatives or air can fulfill their wishness [fm2,-] , so, why not let them die peacefully and without any pain. The other one is involuntary, that is not chosen by the patient himself. It is under the condition that the patient is comatose or too dysfunctional to make the decision. Since there is no hope to recover, life is meaningless to them [pr3, 1-], it is well just that their [pr3, 1-] physicians, families and friends to make decision for [pr3, -1] them, which is for them. [sn8,s] 	It is reasonable that people should have the right to die. Death, is as normal and natural as birth. We give assistance to birth, why not to death, which sometimes is to harder process. Besides, we Chinese people, believe that we are the master [pr3, 1-] of our life, death is [wd4, s] part of life, it should be our right to choose death.  	All in all, euthanasia is good to both patients and their family members, and it is our right to choose our life style, too. Therefore, euthanasia should be legalized in China.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ???  		Euthanasia Should be legalized in China  	In our today's civilized society, we note that the only legal way to take away one's life is death penalty. Recently, there has been a world-side [fm1,-] debate on whether "another way" should added. [sn8,s] This "another way" is Euthanasia.  	Euthanasia is a Greece word: "Eu" means "good" and "thanas" means "death". Thus, "a good death". Its English counterpart is "mercy killing" and Chinese "peaceful and happy death".  	In some western countries, this debate on Euthanasia has achieved a historical result: Uruguay has legalized mercy killing explicitly. Switzerland, Norway and Germany have adopted alike approaches. However, in America, the most liberal country of the world, this debate caused great divergence among its people. Their conflicting views on Euthanasia can be seen in two cases. One involved Dr. Herman N. Sanders from New Hampshire in the early 1950s. He gave four lethal injections of air to his patient who was an sixty year old woman suffering form great pain of cancer. He was declared innocent after a lengthy court procedures. Another case involved Harold Mohar from Pennsylvania. He shot his cancer-stricken brother in his request. But he was sentence [vp7, 1-] to from three to six years [wd4, s] in jail. This debate, in the whole, hasn't got a unified opinion in all western countries.  	What is happening in China, a country with a population according [wd3,s-] for one fifth of [wd4, s] world? [sn8,s] Should Euthanasia be legalized in China?  	In my opinion, euthanasia should be legalized in China.  	Chinese people's views on death are changing with the development of education. Darwin's theory of evolution has been widely accepted. " Man's ancestors are monkeys. " said this in a half-joking, but not skeptical way. Nothing can escape from death. It is the law of life. "Death should not be viewed as a failure, but as a normal stage of life. People have the right to die" said Cai Wenmei, an associate professor at the institute of Population at Beijing University. According to one 200-old-people survey, 92 per cent do not fear death. They just want to die with dignity and peace. " Euthanasia is a progressive way to die", said a report in Beijing Daily. Even Deng Ying Chao, widow of former premier of China Zhou Enlai, said that she is very much in favour of mercy killing as a pratical [fm1,-] concept.  	This changing in people's concepts do not have no basis. With the increase in life [cc1,-1] standard, people's life expectancy is much longer than before. People are satisfied with the length and put more attention to the quatily [fm1,-] and want to live a significant life which benifit [fm1,-] himself, his family and the society. Also, today's medical technology can extend one's life in most cases. It's good to extend heathy [fm1,-] life. Is it good to extend suffering if the patients will certainly die or can not gain conscious in all his life? Moreover, it's a big finacial [fm1,-] burden to the patients' miserable family. In this case, I think, most patients will choose euthanasia, which will also be agreed by their family. The only thing waiting to do is to legalize it.  	Some might argue that legalizing euthanasia will cause abuse. But we will not "stop eating for something once stuck in the throat". This Chinese saying should be learned by those who are against euthanasia. [sn8,s] Everything has two sides. What needs us to do is to minimize the effects of the bad side.  	Cai Wenmei suggests " working out laws on euthanasia to protect the practice. Mercy killing... should be performed only at the patient's request, with the consent of his relatives and signature of a lawyer." Of course, it is easy to talk. This suggestion is only a general advise.[fm1,-] [np5,2-] More work should be done in the future on legislation, as well as professional morality education.  	Now, we can draw a conclusion that euthanasia should be legalized in China in consideration of its positive effects towards individual and society, as well as the basic situation of China which is suitable for enthanasia [fm1,-] Debate is over, yet more discussions on how to carry it out are essential for the steadiness of social development.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> D"??  		Euthanasia Should be legalized in China  	Euthanasia or mercy killing is a way to hasten the death of hopelessly ill individuals by withholding life-sustaining procedures so that death will occur naturally. Euthanasia is not a kind of murdering, it [fm3, 1-] is only a practical method to help a comatose patient himself to gain relief from suffering and help to relieve the heavy burden of his family and the hospital. And now, view [np6, 1-] on death of Chinese people is changing,[sn9,s] death in some way is not a failure, a horrible thing. So euthanasia should be legalized in China.  	Euthanasia is not like murder. Murder means killing a person unlawfully and on guilty purpose. Before murdering, the murdered does not know his death is coming and he is not a hopelessly ill individual without consciousness. [sn8,s] Futhermore [fm1,-] , murdering seriously influence [wd3, 1-] social order. While euthanasia is different from murdering.[sn2,s] First, it should be on the request of patients. When a patient is on the fringe of death and suffers great pain from the illness, if he requests doctors to help him to end the suffering and let him die, euthanasia may be considered. Second, it should be praticed [fm1,-] on the agreement of his family and relatives. If his family members do not want to fasten his death in artificial way, euthanasia won't be used. Thirdly, before euthanasia is praticed [fm1,-] , doctors will have discussion to decide whether the patient has [wd4, s] hope for [np2,1-] living or not. If there is [wd4, s] hope [pp1, -1] for surviving, mercy killing won't be exercised. Patients who ask for mercy killing have different kind [np6, 1-] of circumstances. Some are really comatose and tortured from great pain, but some just do not want his family to hear [fm1,-] the expensive medical cost and ask for death. So, doctors will consider the condition of the patients seriously before using euthanasia on the patients.  	Therefore, euthanasia is not a kind of murder, it is a useful way to help the patient to end the suffering because every step is considered carefully on [pp2, 1-] the benefit of the patients.  	Futhermore [fm1,-] , euthanasia not only helps hopelessly ill patients relieve from torturing, but also help to relieve his family's heaven [fm1,-] burden mentally and physically. [sn8,s] 	General speaking, Chinese people do not live in a highly [wd2, 1-] living condition, most people are still poor [sn9, s] , it [fm3, 1-] is not easy for a nomal [fm1,-] family to support the expense of a comatose patient who lives on medical equitment,[fm1,-] for the expense is astonishing. Maybe one day's medical cost will support the whole family for a month. If obviously this patient has little hope for surviving, and he has alredy [fm1,-] had no interest in living in the world, mercil [wd2, 1-] killing can do him and his family good. Outside of the expense, it is not easy for his family member [np6, 1-] to hear [fm1,-] to look at him lying in hospital with little hope to live. As we all know, cancer destroys a person's health greatly. If you see one of your family members, or relatives lying in the bed suffering pointed pain, loses his weight day by day and struggles with the pain sufferingly, [sn8,s] what do you feel? Do you want to help him to release [wd3,-1] his suffering? Most people would like to help him, I think. So mercy killing can help the patient's family to relieve heavy burden mentally and physically.  	Moreover, as the illiteracy rate in China is quite high, many children born in rural ereas [fm1,-] has [vp3, 1-] no opportunities to be educated, because of proverty [fm1,-] If we transmit the expensive medical expense on a patient with little hope for [pp1, 1-] surviving to some poor children, we can train many talent [np6,1-] for the future development of the country. So euthanasia can release the burden of the society and help the nation to develop [wd3, 1-] the next generation.  	Also now, views on death of Chinese people are changing. To some old people, death is not as horrible as it was. Death is a normal and natural stage of life. A survey of 200 old people shows that 92 percent do not fear death. They do not want a long waiting period. They want to die with dignity and death [wd7, 1-] instead of agony and degration [fm1,-] A report in Beijing Daily said. From this survey, we can see death is no longer a horrible thing to old people,[sn9,s] they would like to choose a peaceful way to die.  	To conclude, euthanasia is not a crime and it can help the patient and family members to relieve sufferings and help society to release burden, and above all, people would like to choose peaceful way to die without suffering in China, so euthanasia should be legalized in China.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> D??  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia, or mercy killing, is that a patient's life ended in a painless way with the help of a doctor or other medical personnel on the condition that the patient has come to the end of his life with extreme pain and no medical treatment can save his life so that he requires his doctor to end his life. Death is the law of life, and euthanasia is a way of good death. The laws on euthanasia should be worked out to protect their practice in China.  	A survey of patients in hospital shows that most patient [np3, 1-] want to die in a peaceful way if no medical care can save their lives when they are suffering from intolerable pain. Most terminally ill patients, however, can not release their great pain through euthanasia because many doctors dare not do it in case they get into law trouble. Consequently, the patients have to desperately struggle against violent pain which seems endless for them until their death. Their families also suffer a lot for they can not help the people they love to end the pain, only watching them aside. For patients who suffer from late-period cancers, their pain is especially hard to stand. One of my close neighbors, whose home I go to every day, was found out that he got late-period lung cancer. He is a fighter pilot, more than 1.90 metres high and has a very strong body. In less than three weeks he died although he got the best treatment in one of the best hospitals. I watched clearly that his whole body withered and his looks are [vp6,s-] terrible. It is very difficult to see him struggling [wd7, -1] aside. But we can not help him at all. In such a strictly-disciplined army hospital, euthanasia is absolutely not permitted. I hope that the laws on euthanasia can be made as soon as possible so that they can help those desperate patients release their great pains which are unimaginable for healthy people.  	Euthanasia also agrees with moral principles. Since a person is born, he is determined to die inevitably. A person should have the right to choose the way of his death at the end of his life. Since the disease is incurable, it is meaningless to fight against great pain. Most near-death patients would not do that and they should have the freedom to end their pain. Besides, euthanasia is economical and practical. A large amount of money and resources can thus be saved to help other patients and be used in medical research. Euthanasia not only helps the patients and their families but also helps others.  	Of course, euthanasia should be performed under strict conditions. First, it must be at the request of the patient, with the consent of his families and the sigature [fm1,-] of a lawyer. Second, it must be performed only after that a thorough examination has proved no other medical methods can help the patient and his physical condition can not support [wd3, 1-] him any more, with the agreement of all members of his medical team.  	Many countries such as Switzerland, Norway and Germany have legalized euthanasia. China should also make its own laws on euthanasia as early as possible. It is the urgent need of many painful patients, and is also beneficial for the whole society.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2>3?1/2??  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia, or mercy killing, means helping to hasten the death of terminally ill patients without any pain by using some medicines. At present, euthanasia is being practised throughout the world and many countries, like Norway and Germany, have established legal systems to deal with it. Several years ago, euthanasia was first advocated in the National People's Congress and people suggested euthanasia should be legalized in China.  	Actually, after several years of practise [wd2, 1-] in some urban areas of China, people began to see the advantages of euthanasia [sn9, s], but, [fm3, 1-] as we know, Chinese attach more importance to the intimacy of family members, so it's quite difficult to implement the practise [wd2, 1-] of euthanasia throughout China, especially in rural areas, unless it is legalized. Euthanasia is the product of human civilization and social development. To most of the people, including doctors and patients, they have an ambiguous idea of euthanasia. Therefore, we should establish legal systems to cope with it less that somebody should misuse it. [sn8,s] 	The legalization of euthanasia in China is based on China's present economic and cultural situations. Its practise [wd2, 1-] is beneficial to indivials [fm1,-] and society.  	China is a developing country with a large population. In most of the rural areas people are living a poor life. They are lock [fm1, -1] of food and money. If they have money, they would use it to fill up their stomach [np6, 1-] rather than cure their disease [np6, 1-]. [sn8,s] Hence, suppose one of their family members is seriously ill and the doctors say they couldn't save him, and what they can do is to delay his death, then what will they do? Obviously, they can't afford it even though everybody doesn't eat. Then it puts them in dilemma. They think it is inhumane to kill him, but what else can they do? So at this moment, if they know about euthanasia, their problem will be solved, because what they do is legal and they don't have to assume any [wd7,-1] legal responsibilities.  	Unlike other western advanced countries, China is lack of developing capital so that its social [wd3, -1] fare systems are not as perfect as theirs. In those countries, some nursing homes sponsored by the government can provide perfect service to the aged until their death. However, in China, it's impossible and unpractical to do that. We would use our limited money on those who are in need of help. To those who can not be cured, we can think about euthanasia to save our energy and resources to help those who can be saved. At the same time, China is lack of medical personnels [fm2,-] and experts, so in order to improve our efficiency, euthanasia should be legalized.  	Euthanasia can help to reduce the pain of the patient and the relatives. To those who are dying, pain and suffer get the upper [vp2, -1] hand of their mind and life means suffering. As regards this point we should change our mind about death and know more about euthanasia. As a matter of fact, euthanasia is quite new to Chinese people. We only know its obstensible [fm1,-] meaning. As a result, many perverse people can take advantage of it to reach their targets. For example, if one doctor kills his patient by accident, he could claim it's euthanasia. If the family members want to vie with their fathers or mothers for property, they can reach an agreement with the doctor to use euthanasia. Therefore, we should make it clear and [wd6, -1] explicit to the public through regulations and laws to prevent anybody misusing it. Both hospitals and family members should respect the dying person's opinion. The final decision should be made by three sides and witnessed by a lawyer. Once euthanasia is legalized, it can avoid a lot [wd4, s] trouble between the hospital and the family members. On the other hand, it seems [wd4, s] Chinese people don't like to solve their problems in a legal way. In most mountainous [fm1,-] backward areas, people turn a blind eye to the [np7,-] law, so it is more necessary to make it legalized and let everybody know it.  	Since China concentrates on its economic construction, it should at the same [wd4, s] renew people's idea towards death. Euthanasia is now practised and adopted by many countries and we can see its advantages, so we should build lagal [fm1,-] regulations to handle it and make it explicit to the public.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2>?  		Euthanasia should be legalized in China  	Euthanasia means the painless killing of incurably ill or old people. he [wd7, 1-] legalization of it has been a controversial issue in the world. Nowadays, several countries, including Switzerland, Norway and Germany, have adopted the legalization of mercy killing. However, Chinese authorities seems [vp3,1-] to be holding vague attitudes to it. In my opinion, euthanasia should be legimated [fm1,-]  	The practice of euthanasia aims at releasing the pain of incurably ill or old people before they die. Death is a physiological phenomenon as well as birth. Mothers give birth to children with the help of midwives. Sometimes, people also need assistance when they want to die. Mercy killing is in the case. [sn8,s] It propelled the death as the death is inevitably. Since people are born without any mentally [wd2, 1-2] or physically pain, why do they die with so much suffering? In this way, mercy killing is humane. It shouldn't be forbidden.  	Since mercy killing reduces people's agony and shortens the time of death, euthanasia cuts down the medical expenses. In China, the medical bills are paid by the patients themselves and partially by the states. If large amount of money and medical techniques still can't extend people's lives, what the doctors and the relatives do is waste to some extent. The dying people's relatives are able to release the economic burden and the state can utilize the funds in other fields. In China, the expense of cancer treatment hits 100,000 to 1,000,000 RMB which is not available in an average family. Although it sounds cruel to hasten one's death for the economic reasons, the expense is really a big problem in a [np7, 1-] unwealthy [fm1,-] country.  	As a developing country, the medical facilities are relatively poorer in China, compared with the developed countries. One obvious problem is that the hospitals lack of beds for the patients. Some have to accommodate [vp7,-] in the ailses [fm1,-] of the hospitals. If an incurable patient received euthanasia, a bed could be available for others who might receive treatment in time and extend their lives. Moreover, some diseases can't be cured without the advanced medical equipment. The patients merely lie in bed, suffering painfully with countdown of the approach of death. [sn8,s] Euthanasia can solve all these problems.  	The establishment of legal systems assists in reducing some controversial issues. In the early 1950s, Dr. Sanders of Hillsbow Country treated an old woman patient by mercy killing which led him to great trouble and tortured him for a long time because euthanasia wasn't legalized at that time. Chinese people should learn a lesson from this case so as to improve the efficiency of the social function and avoid some unnecessary conflicts.  	However, the legal system of mercy killing should be carefully, coutiously [fm1,-] and seriously established so that some criminals will have no opportunities to take advantages of euthanasia. Furthermore, mercy killing should be based on the people's own will and have witnesses, like lawyers, to prove it. In this way, euthanasia can really benefit Chinese people.  	The advantages of mercy killing can reveal in the fields of humanism, economic benefits and social benefits. I'm sure the legalization of euthanasia will open a new chaper [fm1,-] in Chinese people's life.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> o"?  		Euthanasia and Humanity  	Euthanasia, which originally came from the Greek, means a good death. People also call it " mercy killing". It's defined in the dictionary as " bringing about of a mercifully easy and painless death for persons suffering from an incurable and painful disease." According to my understanding, which is associated to the Chinese [wd3, -1] context, euthanasia is humane, [sn9,-] However, since there are still a number of people who loudly condemn and intend to punish those doctors practising euthanasia, some related laws and regulation [np6, 4-] should be established to protect the practice of mercy killing. In another word, euthanasia should be legalized in China.  	This point of view is important and necessary in the aspects of the patients' [fm1,-] physical condition, the emotion of the patient and his/her friends and relatives, the value of morality and human nature, and the burden of finance.  	The fundamental premise of the practice of euthanasia must be no chance for recovery and the extreme pain suffered by patients. With the unimaginable development of medical science, much better security of life is guaranteed. Doctors try all [wd5, -1] of the possible means to extend human life. But sometimes some cases are beyond the ability of today's medical science. In fact, it happens in every minute and in every corner of this earth that some people get incurable disease, waiting hopelessly and in despair [wd6, 1-] for the end of life, what's more, suffering the extreme pains. What's even worse is that they are unable to kill themselves. Some people strongly oppose euthanasia and say euthanasia is counter to the ethics. But are they ever sympathetic enough to consider the inendurable [fm1,-] pains in the bodies of the patients?  	As to the emotional factor, euthanasia is humane both to the patient himself or herself and their relatives and friends. Imagine that you are now in the shoes of a patient who get [vp3, 2-] incurable disease and is watching the death coming up to you step by step. How can you imagin [fm1,-] that! A life without hope! Without the hope which always supports a person to move forward in his/her whole life! The feeling is like that you were walking along a brightless [wd3, 1-] road filled with tortures toward the graveyard. You are struggling through all the pains, ready to fall into the bottomless abyss suddenly. What's more, you saw your cherished friends and relatives' tear [np6, 1-] streaming down their faces and you saw their broken hearts, but what you can do is nothing. Also, to the patient's friends and relatives, it's the most miserable thing in the world to see their belove [fm1,-] walking away from them gradually and greatly sufferingly [fm2,-] while they are in vain to do anything. [sn8,s] Therefore, euthanasia is a most humane thing to relieve both the patient and his/her friends and relatives.  	Some people might say euthanasia is against the natural process of human life, ethics and morality. I must say everyone has the right to choose his/her own life style. Everyone has to right to end his/her meaningless and hopeless life. [sn8,s] Is there any law will convict a person who has commited [fm1,-] suicide of "first-degree murderer"? A person who is suffering greatly from the pains, despair and the end of life but has no means to commit suicide would have died a hundred time [np3, 2-] if his /her strong will of death can kill himself/ herself. Practice of euthanasia is to help the person to fulfil [fm1,-] his/her hope. On the other hand, those opposes are , in a way, very cruel to the patients. [sn8,s] Their cruelty is as serious as those who are good at swimming, watching a drowning person, not giving a hand, and watching the person approaching death with great pains. Therefore, euthanasia is humane and moral.  	Last, euthanasia helps to relieve the financial burden of the patient's family and our country. The medical treatment for a comatose patient costs tens of thousands of yuan. It's a great burden both to the patient's family and also the country. As a developing country, China is in the bad need of sufficient money to build our nation. Money, of course, should not be hesitated to use in any possible way to save a person's life, but it [wd6, 1-] it's obviously wateful [fm1,-] , then money should be used in more constructive and useful ways. Therefore, euthanasia is a way to relieve the burden of the country's finance.  	Besides, laws on euthanasia should be very careful about abuse. the [fm3,-] evaluation body of judging the real case of practice of euthanasia should be carefully established. [sn8,s] 	To conclude, euthanasia should be legalized in China in terms of the patient's physics, emotion, the value and morality and the problem of finance. there [fm3, -] is still a long way for us to go towards the broad acceptance of euthanasia. The related education and propaganda should be advocated.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ??D  		Euthanasia Should Be Protected To Be Mercy In China  	Death, which had brought tremendous fears, severe agony and sparing-no-effort avoidance, invited [vp6,s-] new attitudes and no longer stands opposite to mercy. Euthanasia, or mercy killing, with the quite neutral and concise definition in the Longman dictionary as "the painless killing of incurably ill or old people", arose a rather heated debate between its birth and its enemies. Yet in many countries, such as Uruguay, Switzerland, Norway and Germany, it has already been legalized and the next one should be China. This does not mean we should blindly follow suit. To illustrate the necessity of the legalization of euthanasia, it is necessary to defeat two great enemies: ethics and abuse.  	Euthanasia firstly invited the challege [fm1,-] of ethics, or more accuratly [fm1,-] speaking, the traditional ethics. 	The most powerful arms of ethics against mercy killing may be concluded as follows: Death is only to be avoided, even meaninglessly, but never promoted, even mercifully. Death, the equally natural end of human's life as its begining [fm1, -1] , birth, is often avoided as best as one can. " Debt is better than death", the traditional saying tells the whole story.  	There are two kinds of cases in euthanasia of incurable patients, one is the case with the patients who are still mentally conscious, the other is with the patients who are actually mentally "dead". The euthanasia of the fomer [fm1,-] kind of patients according to the patients' self-willingness is obviously a voluntary choice without much objection. The latter case may be much more controversial. Ethics emphasizes that we are uncertain about the willingness of the patients, thus it equals to murdering to take euthanasia. I would like to take birth as an example to make a comparison between death and birth, in order to find a suitable definition of " Voluntary Choice" of life.  	Is it the voluntary choice of us to be born to the earth? Had our parents asked for our willingness before we were born? Surely not. Of course we thank a great deal to our parents for giving us lives because life is so colourful, but how about those who are born-deformed? Is it fair,[sn9,s] is it mercy? Surely not.  	Parents give us life without asking for our own permission because they are not able to and we accept it and thank them for it. Doctors, relatives and the advanced medical technologies work hard and decide to provide their patients, their beloved relatives with a release. Why should we condemn and stop their action of mercy and love?  	The mercy defined by the traditional ethics is the mercy for the healthy but not for the dying. We are always used to the tragic scene of a great suffering patient on his line of death and a crowd of relatives and beloved people of the patient crying their heart out beside his bed to just "be" with him on the long and painful road towards the inevitable destiny. What the ethics wish to get from the scene is the so-called clear conscience of the alive at the cost of the great suffering of the patient near his death.  	The second challege [fm1,-] to euthanasia is abuse of it. Everything has two sides of effects and euthanasia is no exception. Some feel that legalized euthanasia would invite abuse. They fear that any form of murder might be conveniently dubbed "mercy killing" by unscrupulous persons. Actually, this fear and consideration is just the reflect of need for the legalization of euthanasia. The present situation in China is that euthanasia is quietly being practiced in some urban area of the country despite a lack of legal protection for the death option. The law which is necessary to be drawn to legalize the issue is not only to give it a permission of existence, as it has already existed, but, which is more important, to provide an efficient protection from mercy killing from abuse. Cai Wenmei, an associate professor at the Institude [fm1,-] of Population at Beijing University, suggests working out laws on euthanasia to protect the practice. Mercy killing, generally induced by an injection of sedatives, should be performed only at the patient's request, with the consent of his relatives and the signature of a lawyer. It should be seriously assumed that a patient is beyond hope until a thorough examination is made of the patient's physical condition and of the effect of further medical treatment.  	We are waiting for effetive [fm1,1-] laws to be drawn to ensure the proper reasonable practising of the mercy killing.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> 3?  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia is a new concept for most Chinese. Euthanasia means "a good death" --- artificially putting an end to the life, as well as the agony of a [np7, 1-] incurable patient in a painless way. It has been a long history that [fm3, -1] Euthanasia is practised secretly even without the protection of laws. The issue is not presented publicly untill [fm1,-] the end of this century. Nowadays debates on [fm3, -1] Euthanasia are taken place widely over the world and some countries, such as Vrugway [fm1,-] , Switzerland, Norway and Germany have legalized [fm3, -1] Euthanasia. In recent years, advocators of [fm3, -1] Euthanasia in China have made very effort to make Chinese people accept it and try to legalize it too.  	However they meet greater difficulties than their counterparts abroad because of the unique culture, ethics, religion. The dominant social Confucian philosophy advocates harmony between man and nature. It easily leads to a conclusion that an artificial ending of life is unacceptable. Nature gives birth and will take back naturally. Chinese ethics emphasizes filial piety. Therefore doctors can hardly expecte [fm1,-] relatives of a patient accept [fm3, -1] Euthanasia. [sn8,s] The dominant religion buddism [fm1, 1], preaches to be mercy not to kill rather than to be mercy to kill.  	Even though there are many obstacles ahead, steps of legalizing [fm3, -1] Euthanasia should be taken in no hesitate.  	Advocator [np6,-] of Euthanasia [fm3,-] are usually doctors who observe agony and helplessness of their patients. On the contrary their opposites are those who never face a dying patient. A [np7, 1-] incurable disease itself can be less horrible of the patient know that he can choose to end the endless pain painlessly. [sn8,s] It is not only a patient's pain but also his friends', relatives'. Let [wd4, s] take Mrs. Ross as a [np7, 1-] example. Her daughter was born severely disfigured. The infant had no arms or legs. She was also totally deaf and had very poor vision, but she was intelligently normal. The girl's life would be obviously sad and miserable, so be her mother. when [fm3,-] the infant's life was artificially ended, it is either a release for her or her mother. Laws should be established to protect poor people, like Mrs. Ross.  	On the other hand, a [np7, 1-] incurable patient has the right to choose to die in order to end the pain. They would rather die with dignity rather than agony. A survey conducted by the Institute of Population at Beijing University indicates that 92 percent are positive to [fm3, -1] Euthanasia. For example, a man who had been paralyzed from the neck down in an automobile accident asked his brother to end his pain. The man has the right to choose to end his pain.  	Statistics indicates that medical treatment for a patient costs 26,000 yuan a year. It is a heavy burden for society and his relatives. If the patient chooses [fm3, -1] Euthanasia, it does no harm to anybody.  	Laws are the only thing missing about mercy killing. [sn8,s] It should be established in near future.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ?T ??  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia has been an issue of great controversy from the day it emergered [fm1, -]. Different people have different views upon it. The cases of [fm3, -1] Euthanasia or mercy killing have been delt [fm1,-] with differently among many countries. As far as I am concerned, I am favour for [fm3, -1] Euthanasia. [sn8,s] In addition to considering the actual situation of China, I think [fm3, -1] Euthanasia should be legalized in our country.  	China is a country with proper human rights. Chinese people have their rights to do everthing [fm1,-] they wish to do within the limitation of legal systems. As a normal and natural stage of life, death is within every people's right to choose. [sn8,s] In another word is that people's lives are under the mercy of their own. [sn8,s] Just like receiving education, freedom in occupation, freedom in marriage are legal, freedom in selecting to die should be one part of human rights.  	Maybe there will be many people strongly against [fm3, -1] Euthanasia, for they have never encountered the brutal experience of dying with hopeless recovering. And they can never imagine how the torture will be to a hopeless person. It is no doubt that doctors are great in helping patients regain health, and medical science is doing all it can to pro-long human life. But, the point we should not ignore is that all these things should be based on the purpose of for the good and happiness of human beings. Is it humane to extend a person's suffering? Is it a good thing to perpetuate what has become a meaningless existence? Why should we cast our mercy on the suffering and hopeless people and help them to shorten the great torture? As life can no longer bright [wd3, 1-] them happiness, we should kindly give those helpless people a hand to end it. Under this situation, the fact that [fm3, -1] Euthanasia is humane and should be practised legally can not be denied. [sn8,s] 	It is lucky for many people that they do not have any relatives or friends who seriously ill and only kept alive by artificial means. They are fortunate and do not have to witness their [fm1, -1] beloveds' suffering. They also do not have the burden both in mind or physical condition. It also is hard for those lucky person to imagine the difficuties [fm1,-] the unlucky ones meet in striving for medical cost for their relatives. But, once they realize that to let the hopeless patients die by medical means is a great relief to their families [sn9, s]. I believe that they will not appose [fm1,-] the ligalization [fm1,-] of Euthanasia [fm3, 1-] any more.  	On part of our society, the legalization of Euthanasia [fm3, 1-] can also bright [wd7, 1-] benefit to it. It is no doubt that in many people's beliefs the value of human life lies in the eontrifution [fm1,-] to the progress of the whole society. However, if they are seriously ill, or lying in hospital in an unconscious state with little chance of coming round, how can they take their proper responsibilities for the society? Can they fulfill their objective, or can they prove their life value any more? ---A mirage it only can be. Far [fm3, 1-] beyond that, they now become a burden to the society. To keep alive by artificial means, the hopeless lives are wasting our society's resources in every minute. Under this situation, to shorten human life turns out to be much more meaningful.  	Nowadays, our country is on [pp1, 1-] the stage of constructing socialism and striving towards the fulfillment [fm1,-] of Four Modenizations. Economic construction is the center of our jobs. So, considering from this aspect, [fm3, -1] Euthanasia is also an issue of great importance to our country. [sn8,s] Up to now, although the high-speed development in our country, many areas can not shake off poverty yet. [sn8,s] And many innocent children are still encountering the fate of hopeless education. However, in the hospital, many meaningless existences [fm1,-] are wasting the blood of our society. [sn8,s] To keep them alone perhaps is at the price of thousands innocent children's chance of going of [pp1, 1-] school, or at the price of hundreds of people's healthy lives. Therefore, it is more meaningfull [fm1,-] and humane to transfer [sn8,s] our mind more on those poor children than to dwell on the hopeless things any more.  	However, the final point I want to emphasize is that, during the legalization of [fm3, -1] Euthanasia, we must be careful with the abuse of it.  	To sum up, [fm3, -1] Euthanasia is both humane and [wd2, -1] justice. It is not only a relief to the victims' families, but also a great relief to society and the whole country. So, no opposition should be [vp7, -1] arouse on the legalization of it any more. Euthanasia should be legalized in China.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> "?  		The Legalization of Euthanasia, Trend of the Time  	The legalization of Euthansia [fm1,-] is attracting global attention. The issue also confronts Chinese. Despite some opposition, more and more people are pinging for the legal practice of mercy killing.  	The Chinese people have been changing their views on death, and euthanasia has been accepted by a great number of people. If the argumentation was raised in the feudal society, maybe few people were for it. Death was a taboo for people at that time. The fidel [wd7, 1-] children even sold out their property to save the life [np6, 1-] of their pain-stricken parents. As time goes by, however, people gradually refresh their idea [np6, 1-]. Death is looked on as a natural [sn8,s] even like birth. A survey of 200 old people shows that 92 percent do not fear death. They would rather die with peach and dignity insead [fm1,-] of living in pain and disgrace. Many pain-stricken patients yearn for euthanasia to end up their suffering.  	"Euthanasia" comes form the Greek, with [sn8,s] en-meaning good and thanos [fm1,-] meaning death, thus, "a good death". It means the bringing about of a gentle and painless death for disease, extreme old age, etc. Though there are not any laws to protect the practice, it is being committed in both rural and urban areas in China.  	The economic condition in the vast rural areas of China is poor. About sixty million peasants are on the verge of hunger. Since the youth do not have enough money to feed themselves, the dying elderly are always overlooked. The sick old men live at home instead of hospital, without any care from doctors or nurses, no medicine provided. Their relatives mercy killing on them, without any accusation of being murderers. Cases in cities are different, euthanasia should be practised secretly to avoid punishment. Citizens mostly enjoy welfare from the country. The retired sick workers are taken care of in the hospital without any change. The relatively high-salary citizens are able to spend a large sum [wd4, s] saving their patients with advanced technology and medicine. In this case, shorting the sick's [wd2,-] life arouses reprimands. Then, if people are able to provide the money to save their relatives, should the latter continue to live?  	Not necessary. To these patients whose pain hurts eminently and there is little chance to cure, death is a relief way. As [sn8,s] sixty-year-old woman in America suffered extreme pain from cancer and begged everyone who came to her to help her die. The agony Chinese patient [np3, 4-1] are in similar situation. They long for euthanasia to relieve their pain.  	As a backward developing country, China is urgent to ensure the legalization of euthanasia. As the above mentioned, the government and state enterprises afford a lot for the inward [wd7, 1-] and medicine fee. My mother works in a hospital. She is seldom motivated to work hard because half of the income of the hospital will go to the wards of the retired comrades [sn9, s] ,. Usually, they stay at the hospital for five or ten years with little chance of recovery. The state enterprises is [vp3,1-] plunged with a great burden to afford a large sum of welfare money.  	The practice of euthania [fm1,-] benefits not only the patience and the government, but the relatives who are racked with both mental and material burden. The collectist [fm1,-] concept is strong in the Chinese mind. A person lives not only for himself, but for the happiness of others, especially his relatives. The young couple should buy nutritious food and even stay up to take care of their parents. At the same time, they can not stop [sn8,s] their grief seeing their relatives [fm1, -1] tortored. A sick man thrusts great strain to his family member [np6, 1-].  	Lacking of legalization of euthanasia triggers rash behavior. In New Jersey, America, Zygnamiak shot his brother dead to end his pain, but he was acquitted [fm1, -]. However, when Mohar of Pennsylvania killed his blind, cancer-striken [fm1,-] brother, he was sentenced to three to six yeas in prison.  	The uncertain consequeses [fm1,-] of mercy killing calls for the legalization of euthanasia. The law, however, should be strictly regulated and implemented. For example, the type and severity of the illness should be defined; the practice should be performed only at the patient's request, with the consent of his relatives and the signature of a lawyer, there should be a thorough examination made of the patient's physical condition before the act; a [np7, 1-] evaluation body should be established to judge which requests for a mercy killing are valid, etc.  	Though there is great effort and difficulty in anacting [fm1,-] the law, it is the trend of the time.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> "??3/4o?  	As technology leaping ahead, when human still get entangled in birth problem with abortion and testtube [fm1,-] baby, another problem of death crops up in a form of [fm3, -1] Euthanasia or mercy killing We are facing the same problem in China: whether [fm3, -1] Euthanasia should be legalized in China. Though in [sn8,s] any Chinese may give approval opinion to [fm3, -1] Euthanasia, China now is not in the position to legalize euthanasia, clue to the technology lead of both medicine and laws.  	In China, euthanasia is not much of a moral problem. Many Chinese would agree on that, basing on the view of nature.  	Most Chinese are transedenlists [fm1,-] who emphisize [fm1,-] harmony with nature. Human is part of nature, Birth [fm3, 1-] is process of nature, so is death. Survey indicates that 92 per cent of old Chinese do fear death. This provides feasibility for euthanasia on China. In addition, those people who are afraid of euthanasia chaining and hastening the nature process may have forgotten human has [sn8,s] being doing so, chopping downing forest and producing auto. It sounds silly that people should brick away cars and walk for the sake of not hastening nature process, or that human should not build hydroclectric [fm1,-] station for not changing the nature process. The development of human society tells the truth that human activities engaging natural processes are to make it better.  	Death is not only a nature process, but also an individual issue. One has rights to decide for large events in one's life. One can say yes or no on marriage or giving birth. One can also say yes to one's death. Especially in China, death has a favorable color than that in the west. Many beautiful legends involve death. Yandi, the commonly believed [sn9, 1-] ancester of Chinese ascends to heaven on the back of a yellow dragon. influenced by buddism [fm1,-] though, many Chinese regard death as a release.  	As death is acceptable and not fearful in China, euthanasia is not morally wrong in China, but its application requires much advanced technology in medicine and complex legal protection, which China today could not afford.  	The most critical issue people concern in euthanasia is avoidence [fm1,-] of its abuse. Man have [vp3,1-] to decide whether the euthanasia is by the patient's will. Before the execution of a [np7, 1-] euthanasia, there are three things should be included in consideration. The patient, the doctors and patient's family.  	When a patient require euthanasia, the society has to decide whether this require is of the patient's will [sn8,s] or a one. Some patients may not have a strong mind and ask for death with little pain. Obviously, they need not a [np7, 1-] euthanasia, but a psychology doctor. It is possible that euthanasia would be abused for mind disability. In this aspect, society should provide sufficient education on euthanasia and help the patient to decide whether an euthanasia is worthy.  	Modern medicine has been develop [sn8,s] to prolong and some human's life and this effect should not be abolished. A decision on euthanasia should involve doctors and nurse [np6, 1-], and the achievement in curing the disease should be included. Every patient needing an euthanasia should be suffering a terminally ill. It is up to the doctors and nurses to decide whether it is a terminal ill. However, it is a big problem and key problem. What kind of disease and at what level of certain kind of disease should be ranked as terminal ones [np3, 1-] ? This need [vp3, 1-] advance [wd2, 1-] medical technology and doctor's experience to determine. In addition, thought [sn8,s] a disease is current helplessly to be cured of the medical development would make breakthrough on two or three months. This disease is not terminal enough.  	Family 's help is also important in making an euthanasia decision. Medical cases proved [sn8,s] that family's love could cure many disease that can not be cure medically. A patients [np3, 1-] in hospital is also a burden in family. The family should have right to decide whether they will not [sn8,s] to release this burden.  	However, the most difficulties in making an euthanasia desicion [fm1,-] comes from legal system. Law makers have to face so many variable [sn8,s] in decision making , and they have to give accurate judgement [fm1,-] In addition, every disease need enormouse [fm1, -] and peticular data to decide whether it is terminal and there so many disease can be termina [fm1,-] , So, it is realy [fm1,-] difficult for legal system to make laws on euthanasia now a [fm1, 2-1] day.  	Therefore, it is morally avoilable [fm1,-] to legalize euthanasia, but it is not pratical [fm1,-] to legalize it nowadays in China.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ???"  			Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia, or mercy killing, is the practice of hastening a terminally and incurably ill patient's death in order to relieve his great pains and sufferings. Euthanasia is a controversial issue through out the world. In regard to the hopelessly ill patient's unbearable anguish, his family's emotional, physical and economic heavy burdens and the cost of society, euthanasia should be legalized in China.  	Euthanasia can relieve the suffering of the terminally ill patients both physically and mentally. Some people may [vp9, -1] argued that euthanasia is inhumane because it strips the patient's right to live. However, I would rather say that it is quite humane because it frees the patient from anguish and gives him back the dignity of death. Many euthanasias [fm1,-] were committed under the strong request of the helpless patients. The reason why they chose death instead of life was that life was no longer enjoyable and meaningful for them. They couldn't do anything for society or their families. Every moment they lived, they suffered, both from their own physical pains and the emotional pains seeing their families suffered. Only death could give the peace and relief. Since death is their only enjoyable destination, it is quite humane to give them a ride and let them die with peace and dignity rather then [fm1,-] dying bit by bit with all kinds of tubes plugged in their bodies.  	Euthanasia also can release the heavy burdens of the patients' families. The family suffers too when watching their beloved relative waiting for death painfully. They also have to look after the patient day after day. Some people even quit their jobs in order to take care of their relatives. China is a developing country. People are poorer than those in the developed countries. If they stop working, their incomes which support the basic life of the whole family will also stop. In addition, the medical fee for a terminal patient is very expensive. For example, a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year. It is really a heavy burden for the family. Generally, a common family in Chinese family can not afford such expensive fee without the free-medical care service [sn9, s], Therefore, hastening the death of a terminally ill patient liberates not only the patient himself but also his family.  	Euthanasia will save money, medical sources of the whole society. Artificially prolonging a patients life needs a lot of expensive medicine and equipments [np5, 1-] In the case of China, a large proportion of such medicine and equipments [np5, 1-] are imported so that they are even more expensive. Doctors and nurses are needed to treat the patient. However, for [sn8,s] a patient who will never regain consciousness and die sooner or later. Such great efforts are in vain. In this sense, it is a waste of medical sources. It is more [fm1, -1] meanful to save these sources and help other curable patients. Under the free medical service system, euthanasia can save a large sum of medical cost for China.  	There is a Chinese saying "Fa Lui Bu Wai Hu Ren Qin", which means that laws do not go beyond human feelings. Most of the people who committed mercy killing in America were aquitted [fm1,-] by law. For instance, Dr. Herman N. Sanders, Mrs. Ross and Lester M. Zynamiak who killed his uncurable [fm1,-] patient, her disformed [fm1,-] baby daughter and his paralyzed brother in order to relieve their pains, were all [fm1, -1] aquitted. Since the motive of euthanasia is to relieve pains of patients and their families, and save money for the country, the cases of foreign countries proved that it was reasonable from the perspective of human feeling, euthanasia should be legalized in China.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2>????  			Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	"Killing people", when you hear these two words, what is you reaction? You probably think that it is guilty and illegal. To most Chinese people, birth is joyful while death is terrible. Most people treat [wd6, 1-] "killing people" as the most serious guilt. However, what about euthanasia, a kind of killing? Maybe you first want to ask what euthanasia is.  	Euthanasia means that on request of a person who is suffering great misery from illness, one helps him to die by certain means. To the victim, euthanasia is goodness. Euthanasia should be legalized in China.  	Chinese people should change their views on death. Death, "is as natural as brith [fm1,-] and, like birth, is sometimes a hard process requiring assistance". A mother who has difficulties in giving birth should be helped, [sn9,s] equally, a person who wants to die should also be helped. Death is not always evil. Those traditional opinions that death should follow the law of nature are not always reasonable.  	Death should be allowed to be choosed [fm1,-] by people themselves. It should be included in the field of human rights. In China, suicide is legal. However, when a person wants to commit suicide but has not the ability to do so, he asks for help. This act of helping should not be defined as guilt. Euthanasia should be legalized.  	Euthanasia puts an end to a patient's misery. The constant pain who suffers from illness is much more brutal than death. "Extending an incurably ill patient's life means the same as aggravating his pain". The confucianists [fm1,-] emphasize mercy. Euthanasia is mercy killing. The traditional thinking that doctors and nurses can only save dying patients should be adapted. Euthanasia should be legalized.  	Euthanasia is different from murder. Though both of them are killing, their essences are totally different. The motivations are different. Murder is based on the intention to harm others, while euthanasia is to help others. The requests of victims are different. A victim of murder requires to live, but a victim of euthanasia is very willing to die. The effects of these two acts are different. Murder brings sadness and scandle [fm1,-] to the society, while euthanasia brings goodness to the victim and his or her families. Murder is beyond [wd4,-2] no doubt illegal, but euthanasia should be legalized.  	According to a report in Beijing Daily, a survey of 200 old people shows that 92 percent do not fear death. They do not want a long waiting period. They want to die with dignity and peace, instead of agony and degradation. Euthanasia is a progressive way to die. Views on euthanasia are changing in China.  	More and more Chinese people accept euthanasia. China's medicinal techniques are still not advanced in the world. Many diseases are uncurable [fm1,-] in China. Euthanasia can shorten patients' time of suffering. Euthanasia can also help to save money and material, and reduce the heavy burden for the hospital and the patient's family. Euthanasia does much good to the society, therefore it should be legalized.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ?a??  			Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia means mercy killing. Mercy killing can hasten the death of hopeless ill individuals by withholding life-sustaining procedures so that death will occur naturally and quickly. Active measures will also be taken to terminate human life, generally an injection of sedatives.  	In America, euthanasia has always been on argument and no definite laws are made out for this controversial issue. In China, it is quietly being practiced in some urban areas despite a lack of legal protection for the death option. I think that euthanasia is humane and should be legalized in China.  	Death is as normal and natural stage of life as birth, like birth, is sometimes as hard process requiring assistance. People have the right to die when they are suffering extremely pain, and life is no longer enjoyable, but an interminable struggle, when they want to die with dignity and peace, instead of agony and degradation, and above all, when there is no chance for recovery. Senile people and the people who are stricken with a severe mental or physical disability want this practice most. It might be preferable for them to take euthanasia when death will relieve suffering.  	Euthanasia is not only a means to release individual pain, but also can help solve a series of problems. Statistics indicate that medical treatment for comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year, a heavy burden for the hospital and the patient's family. Using medication and life-support systems to sustain the life of a will-finally-die person is somehow a social waste. Furthermore, every family member would have to invest their time, money, anxiety and vigor in the service of the patient. It is a disturbance for their work and study. Therefore, legalizing euthanasia not only protect [vp3,4-] the right of the patient, but also protect [vp3,12-] the rights of other people.  	However, the practice of euthanasia would require changes in ethics and is intolerable with the traditional moral codes. Benevolence, righteousness and filial piety are advocated as individual characters. If the patient is your parent or your sister or brother, are you hard-hearted enough to throw him (her) to [wd2, -1] death by your own agreement? Instead, many think that they are obliged to prolong his (or her) life in every possible way. If euthanasia is legalized, problems arise. Some family members or some doctors would practise euthanasia without the consent of the patient for some purpose. Furthermore, any form of murder might be conveniently dubbed " mercy killing" by unscrupulous persons.[sn8,s] The practice of euthanasia would cause social unstability [fm1,-] in some degree.  	But everything has its advantage and disadvantage. We won't stop using computer only that some malicious people diffuse their unhealthy theory on the Web Site, will you? The tendency is that we establish an evaluation body to judge which requests for a mercy killing are valid before the act is committed. It should be reassured that a patient is beyond hope by a thorough examination of his physical condition and of the effect of further medical treatment. Mercy killing should be performed only at the patient's request. With the consent of his relatives and the signature of a lawyer.[sn2,s] As the process of legalizing euthanasia progresses education on death should be strengthened.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ?|  				Euthanasia should be legalized in China  	Euthanasia is also called "mercy killing". Above all, we can not deny that it is a kind of killing, for it do put a living people to death. At the same time, it is merciful. The continuing extreme pain will be much more suffering than death. In this sense, putting an end to the pain seemed [vp6,s-] to be merciful.  	Some people will say that the euthanasia is inhumane, but let us consult the dictionary to see what does inhumane mean. In the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary of current English with Chinese Translation, first edition, page 587, says that inhumane means "not humane, cruel, without pity". Seeing a person suffering extreme pain, let him be [sn8,s] and help him stop the pain, which action is "cruel"? Which one is "without pity"? Which one is "inhumane"?  	In China, the average age is [wd3, -1] high, and having a higher tendency. The aged people who confronted with the choice of to die peacefully or to [wd7, -1] line painfully account for a numerous member. It is a really important decision to make, as well as a hard-to-make decision. China is still a developing country, it is still comparablly [fm1,-] poor. The cost to maintain an incurable patient's life is quite a burden for the patient's family as well as for the government. Many Chinese people had suffered a lot in the war in 1940s. Seeing the younger generation grown up in such a comfortable and fortunate circumstance is the great happiness to them. To die peacefully become their last wish.  	In recent years, euthanasia has already been practised in some urban areas in China. Although it is still illegal, many people had accepted it. They doubt that if people have right to live, why don't they have right to die? If the government still take [vp3,2-] no action to carry out the law to legalize it, euthanasia will be taken advantage by the criminals, and the real "mercy killing" might be misunderstood. For the appellee [fm1,-] who stands trial for euthanasia will easily gain sympathy from the common people, so the sentence will be much less strict than the murderer. Many murderers tried to escape from their crimes by declaring himself mercy killing. Meanwhile, someone who killed his ill relatives under their own requirement might not be understood by his friends or relatives.[sn8,s] All these event [np3, 1-] could be avoided if a clarified law had been carried out in China.  	 After establishing the legal system dealing with euthanasia, the judgemental [fm1,-] standard will help people to distinguish whether the action is really mercy killing, and the patients who is incurable and preferred to die peacefully will end their life "legally". The one who sent them to the God will not be blamed and criticized or even stands [wd7, 1-1] trail. Comparing the confusion before establishing the law and the order after establishing it, we can see its advantage clearly.  	As we all know, every criminal tried [vp6,s-] to make use of the law. So it seemed [vp6,s-] important to set strict important terminus between legal killing and illegal killing. Legal killings which at the patients [fm1,-] request, with the consent of his relatives and followed the thorough examination of the patient's physical condition should be protect by law. Illegal killings which led by the criminal's own motivation and disregard the patient's willing should be punished by law.  	If China had [vp6,s-] a series of laws as such, the argue between the adversary and the supporter of the mercy killing will be settled. And it is the best way to resolve the contradiction. On one hand, it will satisfy the patient's will; on the other hand, it will prevent the criminals [sn8,s] dub any form of murder as mercy killing. In addition, the Chinese government will sane [wd7, 1-] a lot of expenditure on caring uncurable [fm1,-] patients. In this sense, euthanasia should be legalized in China.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ?1/2  			For Law Must Be Supreme  	Euthanasia, also called "mercy killing", means bringing about of [sn8,s] a gentle and painless death for a person suffering form a painful incurable disease. Euthanasia should be legalized in China although it is still an intensely controversal [fm1,-] issue in the world.  	It was only a few decades ago that mercy killing began to draw extensive attention with more and more cases brought to trial. There were much more cases put on trial abroad then in China. A large part of the accused were declared unguilty [fm2,-] Usually it is the patients who cannot bear the suffering that [sn8,s] strongly request the accused to shorten their process of death. For example, a sixty-year-old woman begged Doctor Sanders to help her die in 1950's. And there was George Zygnamiak who was idolized by his brother wished Lester, to end his own pain after being paralized [fm1,-] However, there are some family members who require their unconscious or unable to decide [sn8,s] relatives to be mercily [fm1,-] killed. Mrs. Ross, who gave birth to a severely disfigured baby girl, who could not stand her child's miserable future fate, decide that it was better to send her to God. Comparing these few cases, it is easy to note that ethanasia [fm1, 1] is wanted either by the patients or their relatives when they are no longer able to bear the suffering and [sn6,-] long for a stop. Often, accusation are aroused and [sn8,s] brought to court. These [wd3, 1-] appeared some trials of mercy killing recently in China, too.  	Owing to China's situation Euthanasia [fm3, 1-] should be legalized in China.  	Comparing with western countries, Chinese people have weaker sense of legal system, of law. It is necessary to establish legal system in order to clarify the legal statur [fm1,-2] of euthanasia [fm1,-] and to prevent any crime committed in desguise [fm1,-] of euthanasia. For thousands of years, China had been ruled under bureaucracy. Bureaucrats had treat [sn8,s] powers in sentencing according [wd6, 1-1] to his understanding of the case and of the law. They were to a large degree, the symbol of justice instead of the law. Acient [fm1,-] Chinese usually hoped that the official to be an upright magistrate. They sought justice from a certain official without the awareness of building necessary ruler [fm1,-] and regulations. Consequently there were no standardized law for legal basis and frequent occurence [fm1,-] of denial of justice. Nowadays, situation need to change in a direction of amplifying the legal system. It is important to do so so [wd6,-] as to provide lawful basis.  	On the other hand, people that desire [wd3, 1-] euthanaia [fm1,-] and those who are required to execute mercy killy [fm1,-] have to have a law to support their [fm1, -1] behavor. The incurable patients that are really tortured by their disease should have the right to die if they choose. Yet, their wish are difficult to fulfill if the law declare mercy killing illegar [fm1,-] or there is no law in this field. [wd7, -1] Samely, people like the Mrs. Ross must have a clear regulation to define their behavior guilty or innocent. Problems, such as if people have the right to require to stop the life of their unconscious life-time relatives or of those bearing unbearable pain must be solved by law. Only when such issues are finally regulated can the concerned parties have their rights preserved.  	Besides, it must have a law of euthanasia to prevent any crime committed in desguise [fm1,-] of to [sn8,s] stop someone's suffering. It is a matter of the safty [fm1,-] of the public, and must not be neglected Especially in China, laws are still to be promoted, not having been perfect.  	All in all, only when it is legalized in China can euthanasia causes [vp9, 1-] be justified most reasonably.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ??  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia or mercy killing is the painless killing of people who have helpless illness or are very old. Its legalization in China has still been a controversial issue. Those who are against it consider it to be inhumane and violating the aim of medical science. But I can't agree [sn8,s] with Euthanasia [fm3, 1-] more.  	My dear grandaunt unfortunately got and died of a cancer. Her death left me a great sorrow and an extreme doubt. Why not legalize euthanasia in China?  	The concept of euthanasia should have been based on both traditional idea and modern context in China.  	Every person has to experience from the cradle to the grave, which is quite a natural principle. And Chinese culture has accepted it readily. Like the birth, if sometimes difficult, the death can also need assistance. Mercy killing is exactly an effective help to the incurable. A survey indicated that 92 per cent out of 200 old people don't fear death. The most importance for Chinese people is to die elegantly and with dignity, especially having their own sons accompanying [sn8,s] beside their bed. They only want to die easily without pains and have their own offsprings deal with their honorable funeral. If then my grandaunt could choose and speak out, she was sure not to suffer the pains or see herself become so "ugly" to be bony and lifeless because of the torture. She would not have feared death and would have been happy to die painlessly and quickly under the attendance of us all.  	Besides the culture, the requirement of efficiency of the modern society attaches more importance to euthanasia. After we were admitted that my grandaunt got a cancer, we were sad and worried all day. We tried to conceal the truth from her. My mother became thinner [sn8,s] with her because Mother [fm3, 1-] had to take care of her as well as my family after a long day's work in office. Mother had to get up at 4 in the morning and prepare breakfast for her. Mother even implored the doctor to come and see grandaunt, though [sn8,s] with no use, in order to comfort her. The only thing we could do, as Mother [fm3, 1-] said, was to lessen her pains.  	But if euthanasia is legal, my grandaunt could have lessened more pains both physically and mentally. At the same time, my mother could have released more and felt more comfortable. And we all could have less burden. Euthanasia could have been a good solution to the patient and his family and friends both physically and emotionally. There are more complex cases that need such a relief. We could never stick to the injustice.  	Humanity is a [wd1, 1-1] rather heat [wd2, 1-] topic in recent years, which concerns human rights or freedom. People have the natural right of living, why not the right of death? As long as it is consented by the patient himself and his family together with the legal proof of his incurableness, euthanasia should be approved. Euthanasia is not only humane, but also fully implements the purpose of science [sn8,s] that science should serve the happiness of human beings.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> D?  			Euthanasia should be legalized in China  	Euthanasia or mercy killing is a proper way to end the rest painful life. In a democratic society, people ought to have the right to choose birth or death. Especially in China, Euthanasia should be legalized in China. [fm3, -1] this will comform [fm1,-] to majority of people's will, save much [np8, 1-] patient and hospital's money and make the society more healthy.  	Euthanasia is a word from the Greek, eu--meaning good and thanos--meaning death; thus, "a good death". Birth and death are both natural events, but the emotional impact and the personal meanings of these events are vastly different. Birth is usually anticipated with excitement and joy, while the reality of death is often [sn8,s] avoid as best one can. But when one lose all his faculties, the rest of life means endless painful. More cure is extending the suffering. For instance, in China, a survey of 200 old people shows that 92 percent do not fear death. They do not want a long waiting period. They want to die with dignity and peace, instead of agony and degradation. Euthanasia is a progressive way to die.  	Extending an uncurable [fm1,-] patient means to extend his suffering and waste him and the hopital [fm1,-] a lot of money. Statistics indicate that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year, a heavy burden for the hospital and the patient's family. So why waste so much money to let a patient suffer more and finally die. If this sum of money is used in medical research, the prospect of health will be better.  	If euthanasia is legalized in China, more healthy people will [wd7, -1] occur. The next generation also will be good. So our society will be more and more healthy.  	Euthanasia should be legalized in China. It is most people's will and it can make our society a democratic one.

Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia, or merry killing, means bringing about of [sn8,s] a mercifully easy and painless death for persons suffering from an incurable and painful disease. Is it legal or illegal? Is it a kind of mercy or murder?  	Some people believe euthanasia is inhumane for a patient, no matter how painlessly. For a doctor, his duty is to cure the patients and keep them alive. How can he let them die? Doctors have no right to do so, so do other people.  	Harold Mohar, who was convicted of voluntary manslangher [fm1,-] for killing his blind, cancer-stricken brother who had pleaded with him to do so, was sentenced to from three to six years in prison and fined $500.  	Although majority of persons [vp7, -1] brought to trial for mercy killing, most people consider them innocent. They think it is right to bring less pain for others.  	Anna Marie Ross, at twenty five, gave birth to her first child, Parla. But during the pregnancy, Mrs. Ross had unknowingly taken a damaging drug which caused Paula disfigured. To survive, Paula would have to undergo [wd3, 1-] numerous operation and spend much of her life in hospital. Mrs. Ross felt certain the [fm1, -1] Paual's life would be filled with anguish. One night, she made the baby die painlessly. A survey of more than 10,000 people taken by a local newspaper indicated that 98 percent agreed with Anne Ross's [fm1,-] action. The jury found Mrs. Ross was not guilty.  	Mercy killing can hasten the death of hopelessly ill individuals by with-holding life-sustaining procedures so that death will occur naturally and quickly. Death should be viewed as a normal and natural stage of life. People have the right to die.  	For the traditional Chinese view, birth is usually anticipated with excitement and joy, while the reality of death is often avoid as [sn8,s] best on can. But nowadays, the view is changing. A survey of 200 old people shows that 92 percent do not fear death. They do not want a long waiting period. They want to die with dignity and peace, instead of agony and degradation. Euthanasia is a progressive way to die.  	The law should meet people's [wd3, -1] wanting. Many countries have legalized mercy killing. And it is practised successfully. Why China can't make it legal?  	To make it a law, we must avoid abuse, to pevent [fm1,-] doctors do not try their best to cure the patients, to prohibit [sn8, 1s-] somebody kills others saying making euthanasia.  	According to people's needs and based on complete system, euthanasia should be legalized in China.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> o?o1/2"  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China Euthanasia, or mercy killing, is an issue caused great controversy. On whether euthanasia should be legalized or not [sn9, s] People [fm3, 1-] have not approached an agreed conclusion. China, a country with the largest population in the world, should practise euthanasia legally.  	The biggest advantage euthanasia has is that it can ease the dying person's suffering. It is the first time I learned that Deng Yingchao, widow of former Premier Zhou Enlai, was very much in favour of mercy killing as a practical concept. This made me remember the death of our beloved Zhou Enlai. He had cancer which doctors considered untreatable after trying all efforts. But he was so important a figure that government ordered to prolong his life. The truth is that he suffered extreme pain, so did his wife. With the development of medical science, doctors can cure the disease once to be thought as no chance for recovery. While there are still cases doctors find their [np5, -1] inabilities, and these illness cause suffering to the patient. In order to release the pain, I think, euthanasia should be legalized in China.  	Another thinking [wd7, 1-] I think will give me strong support is that people' will to die should be respected. Everyone has the right to live on this planet, they also have their rights to die. Owing to the fear [sn8,s] to death, people are apt to assume that survival is better than death. But in the reality, in the view of painful patient and his immediate [wd3, 1-] family, death is better than survival. It is unnecessary to artifically [fm1,-] maintain life beyond the point when people can never regain consciousness.  	Euthanasia, if it is allowed, can create benefits in many aspects. First of all, it can save the money. Statistics indicate that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 RMB a year, a great burden for the hospital and the patient's family. And China is a nation cherished the filial piety. When children send parents to hospital, they would tell the doctors eagerly " please save my father, no matter what the cost is, please". And the cost would be turned to mental and physical burdens.  	As morality is concerned, for example, Mrs.Ross killed her daughter because she loved her, whether this event is morally ok or not, we should adjust our thinking to death. Death is not a fearful thing as used to be thought, it is a natural event. Before China draws up laws for euthanasia, some preparations should be done. The education on death is among them.  	There is one urgent business I think for China's government is to better its medical care system. China has poor medical facility, especially in rural area [np6, 1-] minor ailment can lose people's life for lacking of treatment. If this situation has never been improved, no doubt that legalized euthanasia would invite abuse.  	Time is not yet ripe for legalizing euthanasia in China, unless some improvement has been achieved. But for the painful patient and his family, and our country's reputation to respect human right, Euthanasia [fm1,-] should be practised legally in China.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ?o?  	Euthanasia or mercy killing is still not widely practised in China. And there is no law in China to allow or prohibit euthanasia. But according to the real situation, euthanasia should be legalized in China.  	China is a developing country. Comparing with the developed countries, such as the United States, Chinese hygiene level is rather low, especially in rural areas. Many people suffer from diseases without any treatment. Some people can not afford to pay high medicine fees. Even in urban areas, many people are suffering from cancers or other painful diseases. In such cases, practising euthanasia is good for the country. The country can use the limited money to improve the hygiene level and develop medical treatment for [fm3, 1-] a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year. Under the free medical service system, the country bears all the costs. Such a large amount of money can be used to give medical treatment to thousands of people in rural areas. It is really beneficial to the people.  	The euthanasia is good to the country and beneficial to the people. And at the same time, it is good to the patient who is suffering and his relatives who are also suffering. If the patient suffers extreme pain and there is no chance for recovery, euthanasia should be allowed. A person should have the freedom to decide when and how to die. From another angle, to help the patient to [wd2, -1] release from pain is humane. There is no reason for the doctors and his relatives who love him very much to extend the patient's suffering and give pain and sorrow to their beloved. And euthanasia can be a great relief to their family members, both mentally and physically [sn9, s] looking after the patient is time-consuming and the relatives are even more toilsome. Therefore, euthanasia is good to the patient and his relatives.  	Man should be free to chose [fm1,-] his lifestyle, including death. When a person is better off death and it is good to the country and his relatives, euthanasia should be allowed. Euthanasia should be legalized in China.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ??  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia, or mercy killing has recently attracted attention all over the world because many cases concerning the problem arose hit [wd3, 1-] dispute. In China, euthanasia is also quietly practised in some urban areas of China although it lacks legal protection for the death option. It's time to put the issue on agenda. In my opinion, euthanasia should be legalized in China [sn9, 1-] for it's humane, it helps to release heavy burden for [pp1, 1-] the family and the country and only after it's legalized can the matter be put under regulation.  	Mercy killing is to hasten the death of terminally ill individuals by withholding life-sustaining procedures or even apply appropriate assistant method so that death will occur naturally and quickly.  	According to traditional ideas of the Chinese, life is dear and it's the duty of the doctor to do their best to save the life [wd4, s] a patient, which is called "a doctor's virture [fm1,-] ". It's also the duty of the family to do whatever they can to help to save their ill family members. Especially in [wd5, 1-] today when medical science has been highly developed, it's not only possible to prevent or cure many diseases, but also possible to prolong the life of those helplessly ill patients by medical technology. But is this [wd2, -1] human? Does humanity mean to prolong life of an idividual [fm1,-] regardless of the anguish he is suffering?  	Here is a true example. Aman [wd1, 1-1] Mrs. suffered from cancer. He had received all kinds of treatment, but nothing could stop the infected cells from spreading. He has suffered endlessly from severe anguish. Most of his hair dropped because of the side-effect ofphysiotheraphy [fm1, 1] He was tormented by pain day and night. Each time when he couldn't endure, he cried out painfully, which also tormented the heart of his family members. To him, extending his life means the same as aggravating his pain. Death is a relief. Shouldn't his apply [fm1,-] for euthanasia be approved?  	If we viewed euthanasia is inhuman, we only view life is a biological process. We haven't considered that apart from living right, human being also has the right of dignity, has the right to end anguish and to choose the mode of ending his life, for death, like birth, is only a natural stage of life. Human's life should be meaningful, the highest point of his life is his well-being. What's the meaning if a man's life is prolonged artificially just for the sake of keeping him alive, despite of the endurable anguished [wd2, 1-] he suffered from? If we view the highest [wd7, 1-1] good of human being is happiness and well-being, if we viewed [vp6,s-] death is only a release from pointless misery and dehumanization, then, the means [wd2, 1-] of euthanasia should be justified.  	We can see the reason for advocating legalization of euthanasia form another example happened in the U.S. A women [np6,1-] named Anna Marie Ross ended her baby Paula's life by giving her a bottle of strong sedative. She did that because Paula was born without arms and legs. To survive, she would have to receive numerous operations. She may spend much of her life in hospitals. Her normal intelligence would only make her more aware of her fate. Ross end [wd2,-3] her daughter's life just in order to help her out of endless anguish. According to a survey, 98 percent of the 10,000 people agreed with Ross's [fm1,-] action. In fact, if euthanasia is applied to relieve pointless and endless suffering, people adopted a comprehisable [fm1,-] attitude. According to a survey conducted in China, 92 percent of the 200 old people said that they do not fear death. They want to "die with dignity and peace insteading [fm1,-] of agony and degration [fm1,-] ". Therefore, euthanasia is a progressive way to die. It has the real sence [fm1,-] of humanity.  	Moreover, it's not only the ill patient who is tortured, his family members are also suffered severely. They have to endure to [sn8,s] see their previously loved one to be tortured. In addition, the family and the country may be imposed with a heavy burden concerning medical fee involved. Statistics indicate that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year, which becomes a heavy burden for the hospital and the patient's family. In our country when the people's life is still not better-off and the country is in urgent demand for construction fund, this is surely a heavy burden which, if not deals with properly will hinter [fm1,-] the country's development. Why shouldn't we approve euthanasia if it's good for both the patient and the country?  	Lastly, only when euthanasia is legalized can we put the matter under regulation. A lot of dispute is arosed [fm1,-] in the US because this matter is not stipalated [fm1,-] by law. Therefore, euthanasia should be legalized to provide legitimate base for it to apply. And besides, only after it's legalized can law be made sure that it's not used for unwholesome purposes.  	Therefore, euthanasia should be legalized in China. It's a release for the patient's family, for the country and most importantly, for the patient himself. Although it might require a long time to gain changes in ethics, it must be remembered that it's a highest sence [fm1,-] of humanity, for it considers human-beings altimate [fm1,-] well-being.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> 2e  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized In China  	As to the legalization of euthanasia, many disputes and arguements [fm1,-] have been hold to produce an answer whether it is illegal or not. The main controversial problem is whether euthanasia is a murder and whether it is inhumane. Many countries have adopted its legalization, while in China, though euthanasia is quietly practised in some urban areas, it still lacks legal protection for the death option. Personally, I think euthanasia should be legalized for the benefits of both inviduals [fm1,-] and the society.  	First, euthanasia is not murder. It is withholding life-sustaining procedures to hasten the death of hopelessly ill individuals. It is mercy killing and good killing because it helps to relieve patients' extreme pain, who have no chance for recovery. What's more, the practice of euthanasia is performed only at the patient's request, with the consent of his relatives and the signature of a lawyer. It is very different from a murder which deprives a person of his life feloniously, willfully are of his own malsie [fm1,-] and aforethought against the victim's free will for the sake of a murderer's own benefit. A performer of euthanasia, usually a doctor or a direct relative of the patient, kills the suffered, either actively or passively, in accordance with the choice and benefit of the patient, otherwise, they will not do so. Therefore they should not be condemned as mercilessly guilty murder.  	Second, euthanasia is not only of guilt, but also is humane. What a great torture to witness your dearest and closest lying hopelessly in the bed, and waiting in agony and despair for the coming of death, yet you can do nothing about it. " Extending an incurably ill patient's life means the same as aggravating his pain", said Cai Wenmei, an associate professor at the Institute of Population at Beijing University [sn9, s] Cai said, death should not be viewed as a failure, but as a normal and natural stage of life. People should have the right to choose to die. Euthanasia provide an opportunity for this choice.  	Third, euthanasia has become more acceptable, by most old Chinese people. A survey of 200 old people shows that 92 percent do not fear death. They do not want a long waiting period. They want to die with dignity and peace, instead of agony and degradation. Views on death are changing in China. Therefore, euthanasia has been getting more support and approval. Deng Yingchao, widow of former Premier Zhou Enlai said that she is very much in favour of mercy killing as a practical concept.  	Fouth [fm1,-] euthanasia is not only feasible, but also beneficial to the society economically. Statistics indicate that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year, a heavy burden for the hospital and the patient's family. The debt, which is caused by the expenditure and cost for curing an incurable disease, usually throws a family into a crisis or even ruin. If on the contrary, we use that sum of money and those medicines and equipments [np5, 1-] to do more practical and meaningful things such as saving a less seriously ill patient, it will do good to others and the society.  	Fifth, we [wd7, 1-] by proposing to legalize the euthanasia, do not mean to invite abuse. Any form of murder might be conveniently dubbed "mercy killing" by unscrupulous persons. In response, we should establish an evaluation body to judge which requests for a mercy killing are valid before the act is committed. The first requirement of euthanasia,[sn9,s] is that a person's choice should be respected. In the case of Anna Marie Ross [sn9, s] she gave birth to a severely disfigured baby, who had no [wd6, 1-1] arms or legs and her face was badly deformed. Taking it for granted that the infant will have a bad fate, she one night put Paula to bed and gave her a bottle containing a strong sedative. The baby died painlessly during the night. Anna Ross killed her baby, without the agreement of her baby, though she said she killed her because she loved her. However, the case is hardly to be said a valid one for euthanasia. In China, learning from other countries' lessons, perfecting [sn8,s] of the regulations and procedures is urgent. Although, there is still a long way to go for perfection of the related laws and regulations, and for the wide acceptance of it throughout China, we hold a firm belief in the inevitability of the adoption and legalization of euthanasia.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> 11/4  			Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia, or mercy killing should be legalized in China because a person has choices about lifestyle, including death. And helping to hasten the death of terminally ill patients is not only a release of the patients themselves but also a release of their families. Another reason why euthanasia is accepted by more and more people in China is that people change their concept of death viewing it a natural process instead of a failure. However though the introduction of euthanasia in China seems reasonable [sn9, s] it is necessary for us to legalize euthanasia to prevend [fm1,-] it from becoming a crime excuse of some uncrupulous [fm1,-] persons.  	Euthanasia, or mercy killing, is generally induced by an injection of sedatives in order to help hasten the death of terminally ill patients which is performed at the patients' request and with the consent of their relatives.  	Firstly euthanasia is reasonable because we have the right to choose our own lifestyle, including death. We are the owner of our life [sn8,s] responsering [fm1,-] for our own behaviours. Usually what we are supposed to do when we found that there are no possibilities of our recovery and we have to suffer the pain day and night? And as we are not in the position to carry out our plan euthanasia offers us an ideal way. Just like those people who committed suicide [sn9, d] we end up our life willingly with other persons' assistance [sn9, s-] while they do it with their own hands. Since suicide is not a crime in China, nor is euthanasia.  	Secondly the reason why more and more Chinese people support euthanasia is because it can release the pain of both the patients and their relatives. The aim for the Chinese government of developing medical techniques is to improve the Chinese people's living condition providing them joy and happiness. But since there are few chances for the terminally in [fm1,-] patients to recover it becomes a kind of torture. Patients have to suffer the pain with disappointment. Prolonging their life offers not longer happiness but sorrow. This situation is also a torture for their relatives. Because apart from their sadness they have to pay for the medical treatment fee which is a heavy burden for them.[sn2,s] As China is a developing country with a large population, it's impossible for everyone to enjoy the state medical welfare.  	Therefore euthanasia, like the family-planning policy, is very useful in China. The family-planning policy which was adopted in the late 1970s and once had been a controversial topic in China, has showed its importance to the nation's economy development by its effectiveness. The family-planning policy has helped reduce the population by millions of people which makes it possible for the government to have more investment and energy to develop the economy. In the same way the legalization of euthanasia will show its importance to the nation's development.  	The last reason for the legalization of euthanasia in China is that the Chinese people have changed their concept of death. In the past many Chinese people avoided to [sn8,s] talk about death and considered it a failure. Nowadays a more natural view has been formed--death is natural stage of life which helps people face their fate bravely. Therefore when it comes to the time people accept it more easily. This is the theorical [fm1,-] foundation of the legalization of euthanasia in China.  	However it's necessary for us to legalize euthanasia in China for it may be used in some illegal ways by some bad-purposed persons. China is such a big country where the situations are different in terms of different areas. The legalization of euthanasia is helpful for us to distinguish compliticative [fm1, 1] conditions in order to find whether it is for the good will or not. It's important for us to prevend [fm1,-] euthanasia from becoming a crime excuse of some uncrupulous [fm1,-] persons.  	Euthanasia should be legalized in China because many Chinese people support it. It has its theorical [fm1,-] foundation in China---people have changed their view [np6, 1-] of death. And another reason why the Chinese people accept it is because it can release the pain of the patients and their relatives. And the legalization of euthanasia is also helpful for the nation's development.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> 3??to  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia in literal meaning, is a good death, which medically hastens the patient's death to realise [fm1,-] their torturous pain. Nowadays, hot debates have aroused over the topic of "should euthanasia should [wd6, 1-] be legalized" in the [fm1, -1] word. There are various opinions and no certain conclusion has been reached. In China, I think euthanasia should be legalized. That's due to the nation's humanitarianism and China's present situation.  	The Chinese nation take [vp3,1-]humanitarianism seriously and at the same time the country ensure the human rights almost in every aspects. Euthanasia is a progressive way to die which realise [fm1,-] the patient's suffering and this medical technology is humane. When a person is at the edge of death and there is no chance for him to come around, he and his family are all burded [fm1,-] with imaginable pain mentally and physically. [fm3, -1] the process of waitting [fm1,-] for death is cruel and the patient have [vp3,2-] to suffer the great pain all the time, also the end [sn8,s] of death is coming at last. [fm3, -1] take a case for example, a sixty-year old woman was dying of cancer, and she had wasted away from 140 pounds to 80 pounds. There was no chance for her recovery. Every day she suffered extream [fm1,-] pain and screamed out in anguish from her bed. She begged everyone to help her die. Faced with this case what should we do, continuing to lengthen her life medically or carrying out euthasaia [fm1,-] for her ? Obviously, euthanasia is the best way for her. It's unnecessary to artifically [fm1,-] maintain life beyond the point when people can never gain consciousness because extending an incurably ill patient's life is just aggravating his pain [np6, 1-] Death is as [sn8,s] birth as a kind of right of people. People have the right of birth, of course, they also have their rights of death. Death is also as the process of birth requiring assistance. Euthanasia, the process to help to hasten the death of terminally ill patients is obviously humane. It just hastened [vp6,s-] an extremely brutal end and grealy [fm1,-] alleviate a patient's suffering and reduce the pressure of both the patient and their family.  	Enthanasia [fm1,-] is necessary and beneficial for our country. China is a developing country and there exists many obstacles in developing our country and socialism [wd2, 1-] construction, such as the lack of fund. Also the Chinese people is not very rich and even some family is puzzed [fm1,-] by poverty. while [fm3,-] our country's medical cost is [wd2, -1] enormously [sn9, s] statistics have indicate that medical treatment for a camatose [fm1,-] patient costs 26,000 yuan a year. That's a heavy burden for the country, for the hospital and the patient's family. If the patient is suffered with a [np7, 1-] incurably cancer, extending his life medically just waste the money and increase the family burden and also the country's burden. Enthanasia [fm1,-] is the best solution. It relieve [vp3,1-] the patient's pain and also is a great relief to their [pr3, 1-] family and our country.  	Considering all the situation and benefits the enthanasia [fm1,-] brings about, we should make enthanasia [fm1,-] legalize [sn8, 1-] in China and work out laws on euthanasia to protect the pratice [fm1,-] and at the same time prevent from any form of murder under the guise of euthanasia by [fm1, -1] uncrupulous persons.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ??3??  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia, or mercy killing, which helps to hasten the death of terminally ill patients, is quietly being practised in some urban areas of China despite a lack of protection by law for this death alternative.  	There is a traditional saying in China that a bad living is better than a good death (Hao Si Bu Ru Lai Huo Zhe). Although views on death are changing now, many people still consider it inhumane to perform mercy killing for [pp1, 1-] a patient, no matter how torturously painful he (or she) is and no matter how painless the process is. Thus, the general adoption of the practice of enthanasia [fm1,-] would require changes in ethics.  	There is no denying that everyone [vp3, -1] have the right of survival which should not be deprived of by anyone else. But is euthanasia equal to murder? No. When a person is suffering extreme pain and there is no chance for recovery, to prolong his (her) life artificially by medical technology is, to some degree, equal to extending human suffering. I don't think witnessing people's death in anguish is more humane than giving him (her) a hand when making death option. Take the most famous mercy killing case in America's history as an example, Dr. Herman N. Sanders a doctor of good reputation, had been treating a sixty-year-old woman who was dying of cancer. [fm3, -1] the woman had wasted away from 140 pounds to 80 pounds. There was no chance for recovery and has suffered torturous pain begging everyone who came near her to help her die. When in the end there was little Dr. Sanders could do to release her pain, he gave her four lethal injections of air, which caused her to die painlessly in under ten minutes. Can he be condemned to be a murderer or could it be justice to put him to jail regardless of his integrity and good will. In my opinion, to allow the patient die with dignity and peace is better than asisting [fm1,-] his (her) meaningless [sn8,s] even suffering existence. It is a good thing to prolong people's life provided one enjoys perfect health, but it is possibly not a good thing to save one's life artificially when he (she) is stricken with a severe mental or physical disability or extremely poor health. In this sense, the traditional concept on death which is deep-rooted in Chinese people's mind [sn8,s] should be changed. We should prefer a significant life than a meaningless existence, we should cherish life and at the same time have a healthy concept on death, which is the law of life like birth.  	Legal system should be established to deal with euthanasia. Many countries have legalized mercy killing like Vruguary [fm1,-] Switzerland, Norway, and Germany. China, when carrying on the policy of opening to the outside world, should absorb this idea and keep up with the trend. We should work out laws on euthanasia to protect the practice. Mercy killing, generally induced by an injection of sedatives, should be performed only at the patient's request, with the agreement of his (her) relatives and the signature of a lawyer. However, some may doubt that legalized euthanasia would invite abuse. Any form of murder might be conveniently dubbed "mercy killing" by unscrupulous [wd6,1 -] person. Therefore, there should be a standard being established. Some American euthanasia proponents have suggested to set [vp5,2-] up an evaluation body to judge which requests for a mercy killing are valid before the act is committed. This suggestion is also practical in China's case.  	Furthermore, in order to promote the legalization of euthanasia, the influence of traditional ideas should be deduced or removed by an effective means of education and mass-media promotion. A law can be carried on smoothly or not depend on how it is accepted by the nationals.  	The last point I want to mention is that China is a country which invite positive views towards life. No one will deny life is a struggle or as competition. Euthanasia will not provide a [np7, 1-] excuse for those who fear [vp1, 1-1] for facing reality and want [sn8,s] commit suicide as a retreat from struggle.  	Generally speaking, euthanasia should be legalized in China as a way to promote democracy and human rights.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ???  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia or mercy killing means bring about [sn8,s] of a mercifully easy and painless death for persons suffering from an incurable and painful disease. It's a new phenomenon of human behavior, we should established [vp9, 1-] a law to define and protect this behavior. In addition, the mercy killing is humane; it is a measure to hasten the death of human being for the sake of mercy.  	The court consider euthanasia as murder at the begining [fm2,-] of the emergence of this phenomenon. In the case of the most famous mercy killing event in America's history involves Dr. Herman N. Sanders, who had given his patient four lethal injections of air, which caused her to die painlessly in under then [fm1,-] minutes. Although a lot of people tried to defend Dr. Sanders, a grand jury indicted him for first-degree murder, which is unfair and irrational. According to the definition of murder it should have two basic [np3, 1-1] element. One is the behavior should be done willfully and of his own malice; the other is it should be sprung for a motivation. Although mercy killing is a willing behavior, Do [fm3, 1-] you think hasten someone's death for the sake of mercy, for the motivation to release his pain is a sinful murder? It is ridiculous to say yes. The entry for murder is not available for euthanasia.  	The law is established as a rule for human being's behavior. It should be developed and altered as to be more synthetic, distinctive, rational and meticulous coincided with the deeper research and the new phenomenon of human behavior. Therefore, the law administrator should not treated [vp9, 2-] the new phenomenon mechanically base [wd2, 1-] on the outdated law. In the aforesaid case, the attorney-general of New Hampshire charge Dr. Sanders according to the entry of murder is rash and unreasonable. Although Chinese law is less complicated than the one of United States, we should also treat the new phenomenon flexibly, in spite of the relative stable state of the law.  	The Euthanasia is humane, because it is [sn8,s] purpose is mercy. Chinese consider humanism as a respect for human right and let people live happily. Human being have right to keep alive and also have right to give up his painful life which [sn8,s] doom to die rapidly. Let people enjoy a happy life is mercy. If the life is comig [wd7, 1-] close to the death, do you think prolong his painful life and let him die in agonizing condition is humanism?  	Since euthanasia is [wd4, s] new phenomenon, we should establish system for it; Since it is ethical, we should make a measure to protect and define it.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> "?  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia, so [fm1,-] called mery [fm1,-] killing, with purpose of hastening the death of terminally ill patients is quietly being practise [vp7, 1-] in ill [wd7, 1-] some urban areas of China. Yet it is a rather controversial issue because of the involving of artificial actions. Chinese, perhaps are the people who have the most obsessive interest in prolonging human span. As a result, Chinese people are sensitive to death and there is a traditional saying that debt is better than death. Despite all these circumstances, I still insist on legalization of euthanasia for the following three causes:  	First the choice to death is actually a kind of human right. In our collective society, individual rights are respected on the condition that they do not intefere [fm1,-] with others interest and, most importantly, not be harmful to the country. In fact, euthanasia is, as Dr. Sanders said, "merely hastened [vp6,s-] an extremely brutal end." According to a survey of 200 old people, 92 per cent do not fear death. They do not want a long waiting period but to die with dignity and peace, instead of agony and degradation. Euthanasia is a progressive way to die, said a report in Beijing Daily.  	Second, euthanasia does not cause any loss to the country. On the contrary, it can save a large amount of money for our country and is a relief for the patient's family. Statistics indicate that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year, a heavy burden for the hospital and the patient's family. If euthanasia is practised, this amount of money can be saved and put into research of some incurable disease, like cancer. I believe any exploration in this field will benifit [fm1,-] human being a lot, with which [sn8,s] this amount of money's initial usage of prolonging a meaningless existence is uncomparable [fm1, 1] Moreover, China is a developing country. So every fen should be spent in appropriate way.  	Finally, regarding to the worry that legalized euthanasia would invite abuse and would be taken advantage of by unscrupulous persons, we can also take up some effective corresponding measures to reduce such possibility [sn9, s] Car Wenmei, an associate professor at the institute of Population at Beijing university, suggests working out laws on euthanasia to protect the practice. Mercy killing should be performed only at the patient's request with the consent of his relatives and the signature of a lawyer. Of course, every law has its weakness. Some social problems are inevitable if euthanasia is put into effect. But we should be aware that we should accept innovations so long as their avantages [fm1,-] surpass their [fm1, -1] disavantges. Just like the open policy in our country. Since China opened the door to the world it has absored [fm1,-] lots of foreign funds and advanced technoques [fm1,-] as well as some rubbish from overseas. China will not close the door because of its negative product. In contrast, this open policy will be further developed Because it is a positive proof of our country's giant success. And I think the legalization can follow the same trace and will contribute a lot to Chinese medical science.  	The word euthanasia came from Greek, eu means good, and thanos [fm1,-] means death; thus the total meaning is "a good death" Its positive roles have been recognized by the whole world. In Vruguary, [fm1,-] euthanasia has been formally legalized. Many other countries, such as Switzerland, Norway, and Germany have adopted similar approaches. While in China, time is not ripe for drawing up laws for euthanasia because the concept will require complicated changes But we can expect that once the conditions become mature, euthanasia will be born with Chinese charateristic [fm1,-] it expands our choises [fm1,-] to life, and therefore give us a new concept of death.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ???t  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	While euthanasia is more and more popular and even legalized in some countries, it still remains a fresh phenomenon in China. It is only practised in some big cities and hot debates are centred [fm1,-] around whether it is moral or not and whether it should be legalized in China or not. Euthanasia is a mercy killing which can hasten the death of hopelessly ill individuals by withholding life-sustaining procedures so that death will occure [fm1,-] naturally and quickly. In my opinion, no matter for the patient's own sake or from the relatives' and the society's aspects, euthanasia is moral and should be legalized in China.  	It is almost a certain choice when you are asked to choose between a painful death and a peaceful one. No one is willing to die in agony and degradation. Dignity and peace instead are wanted. From this aspect, that is also one of the reasons why so many people in China are so preoccupied with Confucians and Taonism. They want to learn from them the way to treat life and death, and then to gain a tranquil mind. The way most monks die is admired by people They die with peaceful and satisfied smile on their faces, for they have accepted death as the law of life. "Death should not be viewed as a failure, but as a normal and natural stage of life" People have the right to die. "Someone said that, when your life is threatened by a terminal illness, when you are tortured by the illness endlessly in great pain, when you no longer have the strength to enjoy the sweetness of the life, death will come to you as the best choice, for life is meaningless to you. As death is the inevitable [wd6, 1-1] fate in the end, why shouldn't we choose to die in dignity and peace? why [fm3,-] should we still have to suffer the pain of life? Euthanasia, as the relief of pain, give [vp3,-] the last choice to life and dignity to the patient.  	Along with the relief of the terminally ill [aj5,-] patient is the relief to their family members, both mentally and physically. Let me put you in a hypothetical situation. Suppose you have a brother dearest to you. One day he was found to have a terminal lung cancer. He began to lose weight and lose hair. You witnessed he became thinner and thinner and the blood on his face was faded. What's more, he was no longer able to smile to you and play together with you. His laughter no longer appeared in the house, instead that were his painful groan and struggle between life and death. It would become a great torture to you. Can you endure to see your beloved brother to suffer so much, being unable to live or die? You would like to end his pain the sooner the better, for you were mentally and physically worn out by this time. You stayed all day long around his bed taking care of him, hoping he could recover. But day [np6, 1-] went on, what you could do was to see him worse and worse and help nothing. As death was the final fate of your brother, why not let him die peacefully? Euthanasia can give an end to your painful life as well as your brother's.  	Promoting euthanasia also do good to the society. It is not doubt that it would cost a lot of money to treat a terminally ill patient. Though it is of no use, money and energy are still put to prolong the life. This can be regarded as a waste of energy and money, since death would not be pushed out of door just because of your effort and hope. You are just making an artificial life that is useless. So why not choose to let that patient go naturally and save your money and energy to put into another patient with hope to life? This can help many ill people recover in China since China is so large a country with large population.  	Someone may still argue that the pratise [fm1,-] of euthanasia will provide the opportunity to the criminals to make the euthanasia legalized. Once it is legalized and perfect in China, the criminal will have no leak to take, since law will do its justice to people.  	Euthanasia has many advantages no matter to the patient, the family members or the society. We should help the people understand [pr1,s-1] them and [fm1, -1] pratise it in China, and make it legalized and perfect in form.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ooo?  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia is a good death and a way to help people relieve pain. it is different from murder and it is just a way of treatment. In curtain situation, it is the best way of curing a patient of his pain. Euthanasia should be applied in China.  	Death, just like birth, is a natural thing. Death is inevitable and no matter how long a person lives [wd6, 1-] he will die in the end. Euthanasia is a means of helping those who are suffering terribly all through their illness but are unable to pass away to die painlessly. It is different from murder in essence. Murder is a means of satisfying one's own interest by killing other people. It does harm to other people. Euthanasia is to satisfy the patient's interest and to satisfy other people's interest rather than his own interest. In China, the medical technology is not highly developed and there are still quite a few patients who are not curable and suffer terribly. In this case, Euthanansia [fm1,-] is a good treatment.  	 According to statistics, medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year, which is a heavy burden for the hospital and the patient's family. In China the money of hospitals come from the nation. Due to the largest [wd7, 1-1] popularity, there are surely more incurable patients in China than any other country in the world. Therefore the nation spends much more money on hospitals every year. To such a developing country, it is a heavy burden. Where the patient's family is concerned, it is a burden both in mental and in physical respects. Above all, the members of the patient's family always worry about the patient no matter where and when unless they are indifferent. They spend not only a lot of time but money on the patient. In China most people are not rich and in order to get enough money to maintain the patient's life they have to borrow money from other people. This will lead the family into a bottomless abyss.  	Euthanasia accords with humanism. Some people say that to make a person die is not humane. But it is much less humane to make a person suffer anguishedly [fm1,-] in a long period. It is painful like using a group of ants to bite a person until he dies. The process towards death is horrible and to see a person die slowly is not human [wd2, 1-] Euthanasia is to relieve the patient's pain and to shorten the process towards death. In this sense, Euthanasia coincide [vp3,1-] with humanism. Denxiaoping [fm1,-] has ever said that to judge whether our work is good or bad depends on whether this work is good for the country and the people. Euthanasia is good for our people and the country so that it should be legalized in China.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> "??"a  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Everybody wants to prolong his or her life and keep young. The development in medical science provides people a possibility to make this dream realizable. Life expectancy has increased enormously. No one would deny that this is a good thing---if one enjoys perfect health. But is it also good to prolong one's life, not in order to give happiness and enjoyment, but to extend suffering and pain and sorrow? If a person is seriously ill and painful, and there is no way to cure his disease or release his pain, is it still a good thing to prolong this patient's life?  	Thus the question of euthanasia is raised and it causes controversial ideas in China. Euthanasia or mercy killing, which is origined [fm1,-] from Greek, means taking active measure to terminate one's life. Those who against it fear that euthanasia would bring chaos to the judicial works. Any form of murder might be conveniently dubbed "mercy killing" by unscrupulous persons. Others fear that legalized euthanasia would give excuses for those who try to escape the responsibility to support their old and ill parents. Their fears many be justified, but we can avoid these situation by consummating the law system and euthanasia should be legalized.  	Death should not be viewed as a failure,[sn9,-] It is a stage of life as natural and normal as birth. Since people have the right to bear, they also have a right to die. Helping to hasten the death of terminally ill patients is not inhumane, rather than that, it is a release for the patients themselves, their family members and also the hospital. Statistics shows [vp3, 1-] that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year, a heavy burden for both the hospital and the patient's family. This burden for the family members is not only in economy but also in mentality. Seeing their beloved family member lying in bed unconsciously is a painful fact to accept. In order to take care of the patient, they also have to wait upon by the bed. This costs large quantity of time and energy. Under this situation, extending an incurably ill patient's life means the same as aggravating his pain.  	The views on death are also changing in China. Although there is a traditional saying that "A bad life is better than a good death", a survey of 200 old people shows that 92 percent want to die with dignity and peace instead of agony and degradation.  	There is no law on euthanasia in present China, although it has been quietly practised on several cases in some urban areas. However, the legalization of euthanasia should be carefully considered by society. In order to avoid criminal cases and the abandon of parents, euthanasia should only be performed at the patient's request and with the content of his relatives and signature of a lawyer.  	Nevertheless, it is still very difficult to legalize euthanasia in China because many people still affected by the traditional belief in death and consider it inhumane to end a patient's life, no matter how painlessly.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> "??1/4  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Life should be with joy and happness [fm1,-] If life is with endless pain and suffering from serious, incurable disease [sn9, s] It [fm3, 1-] is not the original meanings of life. Some people don't want to see that and don't want to suffering from that. So euthanasia (mercy killing) is emerged.  	At the beginning of its [sn8,s] emerged. It's hard to accepte [fm1,-] by people. Because people will thought [wd7, 1-1] it as he/she send the people to die. That's nature. Every new thing is hard to accept when it first [vp6, -1] emerged. But if the person is really suffering from serious disease and wanted to be killed is another case. "People have the right to die." said as CaiWenMei, an associate professor at the institute of Population [fm3, -1] At Beijing University. When life only leave helpless and faultyness [fm2,-] every minute lie on bed and supported by life-support systems and facing anguish every second. If life is like that [sn9, s] It [fm3, 1-] is meaningless and should regard this as a kind of alleviation for the patient. They are [sn8,s] last the relative(or friend). But it is better to see them suffering from pain. But the use of this action (euthanasia) should be restricted by severe laws. because it's not a game, it relate to people's life.  	In China there are still no laws to control this action But some place has happened this case. So, it's [sn8,s] needed to legalized laws to control this action. In case it's used by unscupulous [fm1,-] person. Euthanasia is not a game. Once it happened [sn9, s] It's [fm3, 1-] not means to recover. So it should be considered by the patient if he/she can do it. his/her families and doctor [sn8, 1s-] carefully, and after carefully examination by doctor. So legalize [sn8, 1-] is really needed. Before it cause confusions, it should be control [sn8,s] by laws. Some countries have legalized mercy killing like Uruguay, Switzeland, [fm1,-] Norway and Germany, China also can do that and should do that. But in order to avoide [fm1,-] to [sn8,s] invite abuse, and cause public's discontented. It should be considered carefully.  	Whatever the consequences [sn8,s] their [fm1,-] is still a long way to go for euthanasia be accepted by people or be adopted in China.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> 3?1/2  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	In ancient China, it is said that any hair comes from parents so that it should not be destroyed Chinese in the past even did not have their hair cut for this reason. Then what could we expect when euthanasia began in China? Objection, of [fm1,-1] cause. But gradually it was getting widely accepted and [fm1, -1] surpported. With contradictions between ancient customs and contemporary ideas, discussions about euthanasia are going on. In order to prove the correctness of euthanasia, it should be legalized, so that the right of patients, the calmness of their family members and the behavior of doctors will be ensured.  	Anyone who suffers from indispositions [np5, 1-] is unfortunate. He struggles and overcomes the illness. Then he is to be admirable [wd2, 1-] for his unflinching will. But since the medical technology cannot cure any patients of their illness, a certain number of patients are suffering with despair. Euthanasia can release their painness [fm2, -1] But sometimes with the thought of "debt is better than death", or for fear of being called a coward, some patients don't accept euthanasia. In fact, they have lost their hope to live and they have to suffer from their illness. Legalization of euthanasia will dispel their misgivings and give them the right to choose their lives.  	Euthanasia, I think, should be based on patients themselves. But if he or she is unconscious, legalization of euthanasia is more important, because family members and doctors will be responsible for the decision.  	China is a country in which human relationship plays a decisive role. If one agrees to give his or her sick family member mercy killing, they may be scolded by the society. Compared with legal punishments in Western countries such talks are more impressive. If euthanasia is legalized, those family members will be protected. Moreover, people's ideas about euthanasia will change and will understand that mercy killing release both the patient's and the family's [fm1, -1] painness.  	My grandpa actually died from euthanasia. He had a heart disease and was unconscious for nearly one month. That was around the Spring Festival when I was preparing for my examinations for entering university. I had few chance to see him, but when I sat beside him, hearing his hard deep breathe [wd2, 1-] sound, I was suffering with him. Finally after the suggestion of doctors, my parents and their seven brothers and sisters decided to help him to die. My grandpa passed away peacefully with release. We were not allowed to cry at his memorial meeting, because we hoped that he could go with ease.  	The third benefitiary [fm1,-] from legalization of euthanasia is doctors. They try to release their patients, and hope that they all can recovery. But sometimes it is impossible. Euthanasia ought to be regarded as a method of medical treatment, not the expression of doctors' imconpetent [fm1, -] They will be treated justifiably for their behaviors.  	Euthanasia is not a bad thing. It can help people to have the right to decide their own lives. Whether to live or to die depends on people's own ideas. Legalization of euthanasia can help people to strengthen their decisions and convictions--patient, family members and doctors.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> "?"a  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia, or mercy killing is to end one's anguished life at it's [pr1, s-] request. This issue has been the global concern over these years. With the number of old people increasing and the economy developing, euthanasia becomes more and more the problem Chinese government should solve. After viewing either from an individual angle, and the social angle or from scientific feasibility and people's conception, we came [vp6,s-] to the conclusion that Euthanasia [fm3, 1-] should be legalized in China.  	Firstly, to an individual, euthanasia is rather a mercy than a murder. If a person is in a bad health situation, it [wd7, 1-] will be suffering. He has to experience all the pain diseases cause and can do nothing. It is quite passimistic [fm1,-] because the only thing to do is to wait to die. Life at that [wd6, 1-] time becomes meaningless. Why can't they have the right to die to end the suffering process. [sn9,-] Since it's not a happy experience, hastening it can be a good thing. The longer this period is, the more the person will suffer.  	Secondly, from the social angle, this kind of patients have [vp3,3-] been a heavy burden for the family and the society. Besides the great deal of money spent on him, family members will suffer mental anguish. The family members are so conscious that they see all the pain their beloved experienced. Furthermore, they can do nothing to help him. It's beyond their ability. How pityful [fm1, -] thing it is Chinese have the tradition of serving the [fm1, -1] olds, they will spend all the thing [np6, 2-] they own but all these things they spend brings about the loan rather than the patient's happiness. At the meantime, it's a heavy burden for the society. The patients occupy the beds in hospital and need social workers. They are the ones who only get things from the society. It is cruel to say that, yet it is the fact. In addition, the number of old people are [vp3, 1-] quite large, this aspect can not be ignored.  	Besides these, people's conception has to be considered. China has a long history,[sn9,-] many [fm3,-] conceptions have rooted in people's mind. If we pay no attention to this aspect, the legalization will not be a success. Both birth and death are natural events, but people's attitude 
[np6, -] towards them are vastly different. People usually have a warm welcome to the birth, while try their best to avoid death. There is an old saying in China: debt is better than death. Fortunately, this [np9,-] kinds of views have changed in China. People now put more emphasis on the quality of life than the merely quantity. A comparable short, happy life is accepted by many people. Most of old people don't have the fear for death as they did before. Many people want to die with dignity and peace. They don't want to experience a long waiting period before the death. Instead of the passimistic [fm1,-] waiting, they prefer to the progressive way to die.  	Lastly, let [wd4, s] see the feasibility of it. The social development has enable [vp6,s-] China to pratice [fm1,-] euthanasia. There is [vp3,1-4] no scientific problems in it. Modern medicine science can use various methods to maintain the painless of the death. China also has pratised [fm1,-] in some area.  	Apart from all these elements, some people argued [vp6,s-] that the legalized euthanasia may invite abuse. The unscrupulous persons will take advantage of it and dubbed the murder as "mercy killing". We have to agree that this is the aspect we should pay attention to In this case, a good law should be introduced to protect the legal euthanasia. We should ensure that the mercy killing is performed at the patient's request with the consent of his relatives and the signature of a lawyer. The doctors should have joint approval of all medical personnel attending so that to ensure the patient is really beyond hope. We can even set up the institutions to supervise the practice. At the same time, the education on death should be carried out.  	Euthanasia should be legalized in China. It has been considered in various levels, from different angles. It will be a good news [wd4, s] all the Chinese. We can not refuse eating because of choking, all the thing [np6, 2-] we need to do is to reduce the bad effects as well as possible. Thus people and society will get much more benefits than bad effects.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ?D?  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	In recent years people all over the world become more and more concerned about euthanasia. The focus is whether euthanasia should be legalized or not. Some countries such as Switzerland, Norway have made laws to protect euthanasia, and some countries are against it. Chinese often ask whether we should adopt euthanasia. In my opinion, euthanasia should be legalized in China. There are three reasons.  	First, euthanasia can shorten patients' pain. Euthanasia means mercy killing. Today there are still some diseases we human can't prevent or cure. People who suffer these diseases must die in the not long future, during this period, the patients suffer great pain physically, they just support their lives by some medicine or artificial systems, they can't do anything, at this moment life is meaningless, what they want is to die early to release the pain [np6, 1-] [sn1,s] Now, if the doctors use euthanasia to help the patient to die, it will be a really human [wd3, 1-] thing. Also the patients may suffer spiritual pain. Some patients may have to cry day and night. Some patients need others to feed them, to wash their bodies or to help them to the W.C, although these are what we should do to help the patients in [wd7, -1] sense the patients feel shameful, these helps mean they are usefulless [fm1, -] they are wastes. This is the feeling [wd7, 1-1] pain.  	There are many examples to prove this point. In New Hampshire, U.S. a 60--year--old woman wasted away from 140 pounds to 80 pounds because of cancer. She screamed out in anguish because of extreme pain. Then Dr. Sander gave her lethal injections of air, and this woman died painlessly within ten minutes. In Newture New Jersey, a boy called Geroge [fm1,-] was paralyzed from the neck down in an automobile accident, he would be paralyzed for life and would never walk, how painful this would be! So his brother, lester [fm3,-] gave him a shot with his permission, and Gorege's [fm1,-] painful life ended.  	So I say euthanasia can ease the patients' pain both physically and spiritually.  	Second, euthanasia can relieve the burden of the hospital and the patient's family, if we try to cure a patient who suffered a disease which can't be cured at present, it will cost the family and hospital a lot, however, without any success, on the contary [fm1,-] it will prolong the patient's pain. If we try to artificially maintain life beyond the point when people can never regain consciousness, that is trying to fill the filter with water, it is a way of wasting wealth. Especially in China, the economy [sn8,s] is not so developed, many patients who can be cured are waiting to receive treatment. We should use the wealth on the "blade". It is reported that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year, it is a heavy burden for the hospital and the family. So I think euthanasia can ease the country and patients' family's burden.  	Third, euthanasia is a human right. I think death, just like birth, is a kind of human right. When people think they can't bear the torture of the illness [sn9, s] When [fm3, 1-] there is no hope for them to be alive, they should have right to ask for euthanasia. Professor Cai Wenmei of Beijing University says, "Death should not be viewed as a failure, but as a normal and natural style of life, people have the right to die. Death is, sometimes like birth, a process needing assistance". These words [wd6, 1-1] actually means people have right to choose euthanasia.  	However, in today [wd1, 1-1] China there is no law to protect euthanasia. So I think we should make laws to regulate euthanasia, otherwise there will be a great confusion. A procedure is necessary to practise euthanasia. First, it should be [sn8,s] the patient's [fm1, -1] requestment. Second, the patient can't be cured, this conclusion should be made by a committee of doctors. Third, it should have the patients family's [fm1, -1] permition. Fourth, the doctor should use a painless and human way to help the patient to die.  	These are my suggestions on the practice of euthanasia.  	So [wd5, 1-] I think euthanasia should be legalized in China, because it can relieve the patients' pain and the burden of our country and the patients [np4,-] families, it is a human right. The problem is that we should make laws to regulate it.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ????  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Mercy or murder? Innocent or guilty? These are the questions that many people may argue when they talk about euthanasia. Euthanasia, or called mercy killing, is the painless killing of incurably ill or old people. when [fm3,-] I say "euthanasia should be legalized in China", I mean that it should not only be morally accepted by Chinese public, but also be made by law.  	The approval of euthanasia is an essential step. I have several reasons to justify it.  	First, death is not a failure or evil, but a normal and natural stage of life. China is not a Christian country, where committing suicide is regarded as blaspheming the gods. Therefore, Chinese should hold a scientific view on death. As natural as birth, death is sometimes a hard process requiring assistance, said Cai Wenmei, an associate professor at the Institute of Population at Beijing University. The adoption of "one-child policy" in China proves that it is legal to kill an unborn child, why, then, is it illegal to kill a person who can never regain consciousness? People have the right to die.  	Second, expending an incurably ill patient's life has no difference from aggravating his pain. Euthanasia does the patient good rather than harm. If Dr. Herman N. Sanders didn't give the old lady four lethal injections of air, she may be still screaming out in anguish from her bed. If Lester M. Zygnmiak did not shoot his brother dead, his brother still suffers from being paralyzed form the neck down. If Mrs. Ross did not give her beloved daughter a bottle of strong sedative, the little girl may be now cruelly aware of her fate due to her severely disfigured body. What a relief to these people now! In this sense, euthanasia is a moral act.  	Third, artificially maintain life beyond the point when people can recover is a heavy burden for the country and the patient's family. Statistics indicate that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year. This is too large a figure for an average Chinese to afford. When the family can not pay any more, the country will be burderned [fm1,-] with the cost. China is still a rather poor country, and she can not look after so many these patients. She should invest her limited funds to construction, instead of paying too much for a "useless" person.  	Maybe what I have said is a little but cruel and inhumane, as you may condemn me, but I am talking sense. Facts prove that most people agree with [wd7, -1] any viewpoint. A survey in Beijing of 200 old people shows that 92 percent do not want to die with agony and degradation. They do not want a long waiting period. Another survey of more than 10,000 people taken by a local newspaper indicated that over 98 percent agreed with Mrs. Ross' action of conducting euthanasia to her daughter. Therefore, euthanasia should be morally accepted by the public.  	The legalization by law is another necessary step. Legal system should be established to deal with euthanasia, because it would invite abuse. some unscrupulous persons might dub a murder with "mercy killing", so that they can conveniently be immune to punlishment [fm1, -]  	In any opinion, the conduct of euthanasia should be under three [fm1, -1] condictions. First, It should be at the patient's request or on his (or her) approval. If the patient is unconscious, this condiction [fm1,-] can be ignored. Second, it should have the consent in [sn8,s] writing of his (or her) relatives and the signature of a lawyer. Third, there should be joint approval of all medical personnel attending the case after thorough examination and careful study of the patient. If there is still a shred of hope to cure the sickness and save the patients from agony, we must not give up.  	Euthanasia needs moral approval by the public and strict stipulations in law. Mercy or murder? Innocent or guilty? I think you have already had the right answer in your mind.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ?T?  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	In the early 1950's, euthanasia had already attacted [fm1,-] people's attention when Dr. Sander was indicted for murder because he gave his painful patient four lethal injections of air to help her die, ending her tortures. Euthanasia has constantly been a heat [wd2, 1-] global topic of discussion [sn8,s] since.  	Today, euthanasia has been legalized in many countries, but in China, it still has a long way to go In Chinese concepts, it's evil to kill their dear family members. Although it's not easy to break traditional views, I suggest that euthanasia should be legalized in China.  	Longevity is common in modern society since advanced medical science is remarkably effective in prolonging people's life. But the results brought by use of medicine can be divided into two kinds. In most cases, it does have cured the diseases and patients recover form the fringe of death. No one would deny it's a good thing because it gets rid of patients' suffering However, there are also times when there is no chance to avoid death and the rest of patient's life will be devoured by extreme pain. The patient of Dr. Sanders mentioned above is an example. She is an old woman who suffered extreme pain [np6, 1-] and had no more choice than die of cancer. Prolonging her life simply means extend [sn8,s] her pain and sorrow. Why not free her form her suffering through mercy killing? Mercy killing is a special medical method to release patient's pain as other normal methods do.  	Except the general reason for legalization of euthanasia, in contrast with wealthy [fm1, -1] werstern countries, China has a peculiar reason to practice mercy-killing. China is a poor country most of whose people live under average poverty line. Most Chinese families have no ability to carry such a heavy burden as a medical treatment for a comatose patient [sn8,s] costing 26,000 yuan a year. A patient can impoverish a whole family. I believe it's not only help the patient alone, but also is welcomed by the patient's family, the hospital and the country.  	Why the legalization of euthanasia is strongly opposed in China, The [fm3, 1-] chief reason is because it does not coincide with traditional maral [fm1,-] codes. People condemned [vp6,s-] it because they fail to persuade themselves to believe that wilfully [fm1,-] killing a living person, even if who is dying, is not a wicked crime I wan [wd7, 1-] to make a distinction here. Why we want o maintain the life? Healthy people value the life because they enjoy it. But life is a misery for patients. I wonder whether we are given the right to against patients' will, force them to continue their suffering? In China, a survey had been made among 200 old people. The survey showed 92 percent do not fear death. " They want to die with dignity and peace, instead of agony and degradation." " They do not want a long waiting period." It's human to perform mercy killing for a patient for the sake of patient's physical and spiritual quietness and happiness. It's inhuman to prolong patient's suffering for our own conscience's sake.  	There is additional element which stand [vp3,2-] in the way of euthanasia's legalization in China. People worry that euthanasia will provide chances for some unscrupulous persons to commit crime. We can't close bank because someone will rob it. In today's China, the legal system are [vp3, 3-] being gradually strengthened. Laws and regulations concerning the adoption of practice of euthanasia can be established to prevent crime and punish criminal.  	In disputably, euthanasia should be legalized in China. From medical view, the quality of life occupies an [np7, 1-] more important position than the length of life. From economic view, expensive but meaningless extending of life is luxury of which person and most Chinese people can't afford it. From moral view, so long as patient request [sn8,s] parting from the world, no one are entitled to refuse it. In addition, legal system is a garantee [fm1,-] to manage euthanasia properly. Euthanasia should be welcomed by China.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ??  		Practise mercy killing in China? Yes.  	Euthanasia is an action to, under his request, end a person's life when he has got an incurable disease. [fm3, -1] this method should be legalized in China. I offer three reasons here.  	First, it is a relief to a patient. When you are ill, you will suffer from it, even if it is only an ordinary one. You've got to go to the doctor's from time to time, take medicine regularly, and rest more, leaving your duties at work and at home to be fulfilled by others. However, in the case of an incurable disease, things will become much more serious. Immense physical suffering is not avoidable. You [fm1,-] body is swallowed by viruses bit by bit. This makes you [sn8,s] feeling that you are living in the Hell. It is impossible to enjoy an ordinary life. Hospitable becomes your permanent home, or at least a place where you visits every day. If you are fortunate enough to stay at home, all you can do is to rest in bed, waiting for you families care. No watching TV. No playing basketball. No working. You cannot find any meaning in you life. All you could do is to wait helplessly, painfully for the end of your life, the end of the pain. You suffer tremendous torment from the disease, both physically and mentally. Mercy killing can end all these painlessly. Moreover, it can also end the suffering of you families.  	Your family members suffer no less than you. You are the one they love greatly. They are as painful as you to see you suffer from the disease. You become the centre of their lives. They spend a lot of time and energy to take good care of you, to comfort you. They have become mentally and physically exhausted long before the end of your life. Whatsmore [fm1,-] they are confronted with a critical problem: money. It costs a large sum of money to have medical treatment on these diseases. Take the comatose as an example. Statistics show that medical treatment for a patient of this costs 26,000 yuan a year. This is an astronomical figure to us Chinese. China is a developing country. Though its economy has been increasing at a high speed, the average income level in China is still very low. A large sum of population is only capable of having three meals every day. When such a tragedy happens to them, they will be pushed immediately into dispair [fm1, -] How can you afford it when you [wd2, 1-] annual income is only about one thousand yuan. Even when you are better well-off, this cost is not to be considered low. The burden on your family is incredible. In this case, mercy killing can help your family.  	Third, it is also a chance to induce ideological reform to legalize euthanasia in China.  	In antient [fm1,-] times, moral principles are required to be followed strictly. When you were ill, you were supposed to be taken care of by your families. If you could not work you were supposed to be suported [fm1,-] by others, regardless of you conditions, till the end of your life. China has developed greatly, but not many changes have taken place in the field of ideology. A lot of out-dated traditional concepts are still in existence. Like on the issue of euthanasia, many Chinese still hold that it should not be allowed to be practised in China, because it is immoral, it is against our traditional values. They have been steeped in tradition, from their claim we can tell definitely. Of course, a large part of our conditional [fm1,-] values are to be inherited, like diligence, honesty, [wd2, -1] inventive. But this does not mean that we should inherit traditions without discrimination. Some antiquated ideas should be get rid of so as to make room for new ones. This can enable our nation to catch up with the development of the world. Isn't it better for the patient for his family, for our country to end his horrible suffering in a reasonable way when we could no longer do things on his disease? If we could think like this, so could we on other subjects. We would become more realistic and rational, which is extremely important to the further development of our country.  	So, euthanasia should be legalized in China, for the sake of our society, as well as of he [sn8,s] him himself and his own family.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ?  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Mercy killing, or euthanasia (from the Greek, it means a good death) is the painless killing of incurably ill or old people, which can hasten the death of hopelessly ill individuals by withholding life-sustaining procedures so that death will occur naturally and quickly. Euthanasia should be legalized in China the [wd7, -1] both and new country for the following reasons.  	First of all, Euthanasia is a good way to release the endless pain of hopelessly ill patients. If you go to the hospital, when the great agony of a cancer patient confronts you, what's your feeling? An [np7, 1-] terrible expression of cramps on his face with the sharp and desperate scream will certainly give you a creepy sensation. We Chinese people regard life as a process full of excitement joy and anticipation. Since all there [fm1,-] features of life have been distorted by the great pain. What's the goodness for us to maintain a meaningless life by artificial efforts which can only do harm to the poor soul? In fact, death, like life, is a natural event and nobody can resist it. I remember Hemingway's point of view on death. He never treated death as a failure, in [fm1,-1] stead, he regarded it as a brave action to proclaim one's own value in the nature. A brave and strong man should have the daring and audacity to accept the end of his life with calm and dignity rather than living in immense pain. Death is a criterion of one's willpower.  	Secondly, euthanasia can, on the other hand, release the burden of both the family and the society. Statistics indicates that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year which beyond any doubt is a heavy burden to the patient's family as well as to the society. China is a developing country. In order to realize the goal of modernization, we have to concentrate all money and energy to build our country. Maybe in American people opposite [wd2, 1-] euthanasia not because of financial problem but the concern of human rights issue. However in China, we have to admit that our society can't afford to sustain the life of a hopelessly ill individual who can no longer contribute to the development of the society.  	What's more, nowadays views on death are changing in China, toward a modern and scientific way. Since the founding of the new China, the old and out dated concepts of superstition have been shaken off. The idea of mercy killing has been accepted gradually by Chinese people and taken into practice in some urban areas. Chinese people began to have a clear idea about euthanasia and regard it a way to confront the hard life and overcome the environment to become a hero rather than an evil way to kill others. For example, Deng Ying Chao, widow of former premier Zhou Enlai said she's in favour of mercy killing as a practical concept. She used to support a woman model worker's request for euthanasia and wrote a letter to the involve [sn8,s] authority to pet this action approved. We Chinese people have the instinct of being kind and full of sympathy. We are wilful [fm1,-] to help other [np6, 1-] out of pain. The American woman Anna Ross's [fm1,-] statement "I killed her because I loved her" is most impressive and I believe most Chinese people will agree with it.  	As many countries such as Switzerland, Norway and Germany have adopted mercy killing [sn9, s] Euthanasia [fm3, 1-] should be legalized in China, too. It's not only because we should put this action under the protection of the law but also it's the crucial way to induce the society development under the control of the law. As the economy develops, the culture and ideology should coincide with it. It's the responsibility of the society to help social members to establish a wholesome outlook both of life and death. The law should be used as the guidline [fm1,-] to help those short of sufficient [fm1,-] education as well as those suffering from backward concepts so as to enhance the quality of the whole nation. In so far as the legal system is amplified and perfect, the material civilization and the spiritual civilization can share the same fate, and it's also indespensable [fm1, -] to the modernization of China. Legalize mercy killing, at once!  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ??3/4  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia is always a controversial topic, wherever in China, Europe or America. The controvesy [fm1,-] is whether it should be legalized. I think it should be.  	Euthanasia, another word of mercy killing, is to end somebody's life at the patient's own request when he or she has no hope to recover. It can release the pain physically and mentally.  	When a person is already in his end of life and has no hope to save him [wd7, -1] back. What can we do? Just watching him suffering, watching his or her families suffering [sn9, s] Is [fm3, 1-] it the so call [sn8,s] humanitarianism when you watch the patient torturing by disease? The woman in the reading text who suffered from cancer wasted away from 140 pounds to 80 pounds She experienced extreme pain and screamed out in anguish from her bed, begging everyone to help her die. Under the circumstances, can you just leave her alone because it has not any ways to reduce her pain? The most ideal way to solve the problem and to release her pain, is to help her die. It's acceptable and natural, meaningless existence only enlarge [vp3,2-]the pain of patients themselves and of their families. When the families are watching the one they loved and cared suffered like that but helpless [sn9, s] What [fm3, 1-] a cruel mental torturing [wd2, 1-] it is. Some people may say, we should try out [fm1,-] best to save everyone even he or she still have one minute of life. It is basically right. But aims of doctors are to release pain and restore health to patients. Is it right to prolong somebody's life to make him suffering a lot [sn9, s] I think the answer is obvious.  	Euthanasia implementation can also save money and resources in China.  	Our country is still a developing country. We have limit rescourses [fm1,-] and manpower in the medical aspect. Saving a dying patient is expensive because doctors must use advanced life-support system and expensive medicine to prolong patients' life artificially. Statistics show that this kind of treatment costs 26,000 yuan a year. It's a heavy burden for the patient's family when most of the Chinese are only working for a moderate level of life. Using a lot of money to prolong their relative's suffering is inhuman as well as wasteful.  	If [fm3, -1] Euthanasia is legalized, the patients and their families are released and the doctors can concentrate on saving others who are of hope with sufficient [np5, -1] equipments and manpower Isn't it more human and practical?  	In addition, people have right to die. It is acceptable in China. More and more believe just as their right to survive and work [sn9, s] They [fm3, 1-] also have the right to die. When they are seriously ill, they don't want to suffer more and want to end [pr3,s-] his own life. This is their right. Other people should respect their right and wishes.  	Nowadays, Chinese people's view of death is gradually changing. They view death not as a failure but only the other end of life. Survey shows that 92 percent of old people do not fear death. They don't want a long waiting period. They just want to die with dignity and peace, instead of agony and degradation.  	However, Euthanasia [fm3, 1-] should be strictly controlled for fear of abuse. It should be committed only at the patient's request and with consent of his relatives and signature of lawyer. And also, a detailed medical report conducted by good doctors to prove scientifically that the patient can't recover is necessary. Once a patient meet all the requirements [sn9, s] Others [fm3, 1-] should not stop him from releasing his pain.  	By and large, Euthanasia [fm3, 1-] can be a good way to release pain of the hopeless patients, and can be efficiently implemented under strict supervise. It is viable, natural and human. It should be legalized.   

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> o|  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	If something is both materially and spiritually acceptable in public, it should be made legal. As it is, Euthanasia [fm3, 1-] should be legalized in China.  	China is not a rich country. It is very difficult for the country to sustain many comatose patients. Because of the "One Child Policy", the proportion of old age [wd5, 1-] people becomes bigger and bigger. Plus with China's large population, situation will be much more severe in the future. It is not worthy of keeping a life which cannot create values for the society, but to let it go. Euthanasia will be a [np7, 1-] economical alternative.  	It is a traditional Chinese ethic opinion that children should let their parents live comfortable and parents also want their children to have a good life. For a comatose patient it is a both physical and mental agony to be kept alive while knowing that he will die. It is also a heavy burden for his family to pay the fee for treatment and a big pain to watch the patient dying Euthanasia will help to end the tragedy and reduce the pain of both sides. As Chinese people often say, " short pain is better than the long one".  	As for human nature, Euthanasia [fm3, 1-] is some kind close to it. Many advance animals, such as wolfs and elephants, when feeling itself too old or too weak to make contributions to the group, will go to a quiet place alone and wait for death there. Human is quite similar to those animals. When thinking that his existence is of no worth to the society, people often commit suicide. Every comatose patient must have thought of killing himself, but because of various reasons they didn't practise it. Euthanasia can provid [fm1,-] the proper assistance to meet this human nature and let the patient die "with eyes closed".  	Euthanasia brings relief and comfort to people instead of burden and pain. Therefore, it has the right to gain a legal position in China.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ???  		The Legalization of Euthanasia in China  	With the help of genetics, molecular biology, tetology [fm1,-2] and obsterics, human beings have already got some control over the start of human life. And now, they are quite concerned about their control over the ending of human life. Euthanasia as a form of the control of death, has already been legalized in some Western countries. China is gradually accepting this phenomenon too. In order to defend the dignitiy [fm1,-] of the victims of illness, to save thousands of families from their ill-fate and most importantly, to maintain the progress of China, euthanasia should be legalized [wd6, 1-] in China.  	Given modern medicine's capabilities, it is not impossible nowadays to biologically prolong the life of those persons who are brain-damaged victims or microencephalic newborns or the so-called [wd3, -1] vegetables. However, their lives are no longer meaningful and useful. What defines a really alive person is his personal functions but not physiological ones. And we do not use the criterion of the length human life to measure the goodness of a person' life. It's the quantity [fm1,-] of the life that really counts. A brain-damaged person may lead a long life through the help of some life-preserving treatments. But is this life actually "alive" or "dead"? Another person suffering from cancer is faced with a choice of "to be" [wd7, 1-3] or "not to be". He can either stay in the hospital to make a last, desperate attempt to prolong his life, which can at most only be lengthened by two or three months, or stay in the arms of friends, relatives and [fm1, -1] collegues and preserve his usual life-style. At last, this person decides to devote all himself, all that is left of him to the construction of four modernization [np6,-] until the day of his death. After comparing the two cases, we can easily conclude that life is important to everyone but a meaningless life, a life that is maintained solely through the help of machines is even worse than a quick but happy death. And, under this situation, euthanasia can help the victim to relieve themselves from the tortues [fm1,-] and sufferings, and maintain the dignities of human beings at the last moment.  	China is a country which highly, values the family relationship. And this makes a person's life not only a matter of his own, but also that of the whole family. It is the case that the whole family will be united together so as to defend a family member's right to live. They will either contribute money or offer help in other forms to the victim. This certainly helps some victims of illness to recover from cancers, loss of consciousness, etc. But union is not necessarily strength in some other cases. Fully aware of the impossibility for some patients to recover, some family still insist on seeking for methods, medicine and financial support. They will sometimes drag the patient to a remote area where a so-called miraculous cure exists. Or, they will sell every valwalk [fm1,-] possession they have to pay for the expenditures. Or, they will persuade the patient to exercise Qigong and ask experts of Qigong to exercise on the patient. Often, these pains-taking efforts prove to be useless and rather than bettering the life of the patient, they sometimes even quicken their deaths in a very unberable [fm1,-] way. In addition to the final and unavoidable death of the victim, the family is deep in debt and the family members suffer both psychologically and physiologically. But, if with the legalization of euthanasia, family members will have an additional choice. They will no longer feel guity [fm1,-] for not making an effort to save an incurable patient from his destined fate.  	China is practicsing [fm1,-] a system of free medical service. Except for farmers, most Chinese, young or old, male or female enjoy the public medical service. Though there are some neperations [fm1,-] being carried out, this system, the government still pays for the majority of the medical expenses. There is not a certain system of rules and specifications to determine whether or not to pay so as to prolong the life of the brain-damaged persons and other patients of similar conditions. The government is spending a large sum of money in this aspect which can be better used to fuel the four modernization of China. And with a total population of more than 1.2 billion, the possibility for paying such expenditures certainly increases. However, China is still a developing country and needs to save every ten [fm1,-] to put into the building up of a bright future, An [fm1,-] if euthanasia is legalized in China and becomes an accepted phenomenon and practice, the government will certainly save a large amount of money.  	All in all, euthanasia is becoming a global trend and it is what required by the victims, the family and the country. The legalization of euthanasia will only make the practice lawful and much easier to be carried out.

Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Several years ago, a young doctor from Tongji Hospital in Wuhan was sentenced to imprisonment because of practising euthanasia on his incurable patient with only oral permission from the patient family, who later accused the doctor. In fact, euthanasia is quitely [fm1,-] being practised in some urban areas of China. The idea is widely accepted today and it is the very moment to legalize euthanasia in China now because it is morally acceptable and is good to all parties involved directly or indirectly.  	Euthanasia, originating from the Greek, means 'a good death'. Both the history and meaning of the word demonstrates that it has been accepted for a long time at least in Greece. Statistics show that it is also acceptable in China now. A recent survey of 200 old people manifests that 92% do no fear death and would like to die with dignity and peace. In fact, death is a normal and natural stage of life which is just like birth. Chinese people have not realized their population problem. They consider it alrigh [fm1,-] to take birth control measures and they are now realizing the similar effect of the death control measure--euthanasia Since it is morally acceptable in China now, it has the solid foundation to be legalized in the country.  	Euthanasia should be legalized in China also because of the physical relief for the parties directly involved. Heavy fiscial [fm1,-] burden is loaded on the family, the hospital and the workunit [fm1,-] of the incurrable [fm1,-] patient. Statistics indicate that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 20,000 yuan a year. Most people in China are just at the stage of having necessary food and clothings [np5, 1-] Then where does the money come from? Some factories went bankrupt partly because of the medical case fees spent on the hopeless members. Now many workunits [fm1,-] decrease or even cancel their medical care funds. The result is that families sell their property and are in great debt. However, hospitals still suffer from the bad account of the cost especially on the incurrable [fm1,-] patients. These patients need enormous manpower and material resources. Moreover, this can not be regained because the patients are surely to die and will not be able to work for the country anymore. Euthanasia can [vp9, -1] solved the problem which is extremely serious in the developing country, China.  	Moreover, it is a mental relief for the patients and their families. There are two kinds of incurable patients: one is conscious type, and the other is unconscious type. For those conscious [wd6, -1] ones, they are aware of their hopeless state and the torturement [fm1,-] of the diseases is much more anguish under the traditional contempt for "useless man" in China. Thus an unconscious state is more comfortable for the patients both physically and mentally. However, no matter the patient is in what kind of state, the family suffer greatly. Besides their ordinary daily life, they have to worry about their hopeless member. The feeling is much more bitter in China, whose people put high value on family. It is said that short-term bitterness is better than long-term bitterness. Euthanasia is the means for short-term bitterness.  	Furthermore, euthanasia is an expedient measure in China because of the shortage of manpower and material resources. China has limited doctors and hospitals. Moreover, only some of the doctors are highly qualified and parts of the hospitals are with advanced equipment. However, to sustain the life of these incurable patients, best doctors and equipments [np5, 1-] are needed. Some hospitals suffer from great shortage of beds just because of these patients. As a result, other less serious diseases suffering patients have to wait It postpones the prompt treatment. It may increase the difficulty in the treatment or even lead to the incurableness of these patients who otherwise might not suffer so severely. It is much more humane to save those more savable first and euthanasia provides the opportunity.  	China now still suffers from over-population problem and the problem of lacking in manpower and material resources. Now that general public accept the idea of euthanasia, the time of legalizing it is mature in China for the sake of the patients, the families the doctors, the hospitals, the workunits [fm1,-] and the whole country.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> oYo  		Euthanasia should be legalized in China  	Euthanasia, or mercy killing is a progressive way to die. But in China, It [fm3, 1-] is lacking of legal protection. Should euthanasia be legalized? In my opinion, euthanasia should be legalized in China.  	In China, many people think that it is inhumane to perform euthanasia for a patient, no matter how painlessly. They traditionally consider that debt is better than death. If one of their relatives is dying, they will do everything they can to save him, regardless of the costs. They seldom accept euthanasia. So it is a long and hard way to go for euthanasia to be widely accepted. Then we must work out some laws on euthanasia to protect the practice.  	Birth and death are both natural events. But for the dying people, they have the rihgt [fm1,-1] ot die. If there's no chance for recovery and he suffers extreme pain, he will want to die rather than live. But his family can't let him to die, and they will use all kinds of medications and life-support systems to save his life. Then the laws on euthanasia will help the dying people. He has the right to die naturally, quickly and painlessly by euthanasia. His relatives can not stop him, because his choice is [wd6, 1-] protect [vp7, 1-] by the laws.  	If euthanasia is legalized in China, it will protect the doctors. There is a case saying that, A [fm3, 1-] dying woman [sn8,s] suffered from cancer was killed by euthanasia by her doctor, soon her doctor was be punished and lost his license. This case states that if euthanasia is legalized, doctors' action will be protect.  	In order to protect the patient, his relatives and the doctor who lets [vp3,2-] the patient to die [vp5,3-] by mercy killing, euthanasia should be legalized in China. And it is necessary to draw up laws for euthanasia.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ??  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia, or mercy killing, means a good death. It can hasten the death of hopelessly ill individuals by withholding life-sustaining procedures so that death will occur naturally and quickly.  	A traditional Chinese saying is that debt is better than death. Life is the most valuable thing, the longer the better. But views on death are changing in China. Most of the old people do not fear death, and do not want a long waiting period. They want to die with dignity and peace, instead of agony and degradation. Euthanasia is a grogressive [fm1,-] way for them.  	Death is a normal and natural stage of life. Like birth, it is sometimes a hard process requiring assistance. It is unnecessary to artificially maintain life beyond the point when an incurable person is suffering torturous pain or can never regain consciousness. People have the night [fm1,-] to die as well as to survive. Hospital and family members should respect the dying person's nights [fm1,-] in regard to choices about lifestyle, including death.  	Euthanasia can not only end the pain of terminally ill patients, but also be a great relief to their family members, both mentally and physically. Watching the beloved suffering great pain helplessly is also a misery [wd5, -1] thing. On the other hand, statistics indicate that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year, a heavy burden for the hospital and the patient's family. Nowadays, China is still a developing country, not all the family can offer such large sum of money. And there are many important fields in China lack [fm1, -1] oulay, such as science, education, and the like. So the money and labour should not [vp7, -1] waste on the hopeless patients.  	Furthermore, the sacred duty of doctors and nurses is to release pain from the patients. Helping to hasten the death of terminally ill patients is humane.  	Laws should be established to protect the practice of euthanasia It is good for the society the hospital and the dying patients and their family members.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ???  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia is also called mercy killing, it's a method to hasten the death of terminally ill patients. In a word, it is a way to quicken the death than [sn8,s] natural process.  	Euthanasia should be legalized in China. Because of the following reasons:  	A Patients have the right to choose death or life. Everyone can make his/her own decisions. If we regard the decision to death as a common decision, just as choosing which school to go to or doing what kind of job, it's easy for us to understand that its a person's own business to decide what to do or what not to do. Death is a natural thing, [sn9,s] anyone will inevitably face it. If a patient is willing to come to death more quickly, then euthanasia can be an effective means to assist him/her.  	B. Euthanasia is a way to relieve the terminally ill patient's pain. In China, people used to think that death was not a good thing, so they tried to avoid death as possible as they could. They would wait for the natural death to come. Under such circumstances, no matter how painful the patient was, he would usually endured [vp9, 1-] the pain until the natural death came. Besides, the Chinese people considered longevity as important. However, nowdays [fm1,-] people's point of view has begun to change. Country [fm1,-] to the past, more and more people think that death is no long so unacceptable as before. They would rather end their lives than live miserably, disturbed by agony and degradation. Not only the patient himself, but also his families, friends would be hurt a lot too, to end the painful life would do good to everyone concerned. It's a relief. So euthanasia should be used.  	C. Euthanasia could get rid of the heavy burden for the hospital and the patient's family. One is the financial burden. Concerned with life and money, it's immoral to pay more importance to money. But as we all know, the cost for medical treatment is rather high. Medical devices are getting more and more advanced, but they also cost more and more. In China, a developing country, common people's income is not high enough to afford such high expenses. To most people, entering the hospital means economic crisis. Some of them are often in debt, as the consequence. On the other hand, to a terminally ill patient, death is inevitable, what's the use of paying so much money to maintain his painful life. There's no good at all.  	Besides the above-mentioned reasons, I should like to point out that if euthanasia is legalized in China, it will lead to a good result. As we know, though until now there has [vp3,-3] been no laws legalizing euthanasia, there are indeed such cases existing in China. with no laws to pretece [fm1,-] this action, disputes will sometimes arouse. Despite that more and more people [sn8,s] approve of euthanasia, there is no doubt that some still resist it. With no laws it's difficult to say who is right and who is wrong. Since most people accept it, euthanasia should be legalized. And this practice can be carried out legally.  	That's why I argue that euthanasia should be legalized in China. As we come to the world with joy and happiness, let's leave this world without any pain and torment!  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ??a  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia, or mercy killing should be legalized in China. The word "euthanasia" is from the Greek, "en" means good and "thanos" means death. Thus the word means "a good death". Why shouldn't "a good death" be legalized?  	There are more reasons for legalizing euthanasia in China.  	First, views on death are changing in China. People were very afraid of death in the past. So there are traditional sayings such as "debt is better than death" and " A living ass is better than a dead lion." Now, people read more books and have a clearer mind about death. They know that death is as natural as birth. They actively live their present lives so that when death finally comes, they can die without regret. A survey of 200 old people in China shows that 92 percent do not fear death. They do not want a long waiting period. They want to die with dignity and peace instead of agony and degradation. Euthanasia provides them a way to end their lives when they just mean endless pain and suffering The changed views on death make it possible that most people in China will agree that euthanasia should be legalized.  	Second, for economic reasons, China is still a developing country. Both the country and the people are not very rich. Statistics indicate that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year, a heavy burden for the hospital and the patient's family. Why should people spend money on prolonging a person's painful and suffering life? Now in China, there still are some children who can not go to school for lacking of money. Children are the future of the country. Why shouldn't we use the money to brighten our future instead of prolonging suffering?  	Third, for humanitariansim [fm1,-] When a person is suffering form extreme pain, and he has no chance for recovery, what he can do is enduring the unendurable pain day after day, until Death [fm3, 1-] comes to releave [fm1,-] him. He wants to die, but he is too weak even to kill himself. At this time, euthanasia shows its mercy on the patient and brings him to a painless world. I think this is humane.  	Fourth, Chinese people are used to acting in accordance with the law and regulations. If we don't legalize euthanasia in China, probably it can't be used. It is not good for our country our people and the patients who need euthanasia.  	So, for the all [wd5,-1] above reasons, [wd4, s] should be legalized in China as soon as possible. And the law should be will [wd5, 1-] considered so that no one can abuse it and every patient who needs euthanasia can get it.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ??1a?  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Death, a fearful concept for most people, is now changing its position in people's mind. Since Dr. Sanders medically ceased his patient's suffering, mercy killing has been put into discussion, which has launched a compaign [fm1,-] to revalue the means of death. Hence, with a scientific and psycological [fm1,-] consideration, many Chinese agree that euthanasia should be legalized in China.  	First, people have the right to die. Death, an inevitable process, is as natural as birth. Birth and death are both natural events, but the emotional impact and the personal meanings of these events are vastly different. Birth is usually antispated [fm1,-] with excitement and joy, while the reality of death is often avoided as best one can. However, death should not be viewed as a failure. When a dying patient is suffering from torturous pain, death may relatively be a precious gift. Since induced aboction [fm1,-] is legalized in controling [fm1,-] birth in China, euthanasia can be treated as a legal ending to people's life away from torturous pain.  	Second, euthanasia can not only cease the painful life but also save a lot of medical treatment. A survey of 200 old people shows that 92 per cent do not fear death. They do not want a long waiting period. They want to die with dignity and peace, instead of agony and degradation. From this angle, euthanasia is a progressive way to die. And it accord with the will of the old. Futhermore [fm1,-] statistics indicate that medical treatment for comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year, a heavy burden for the hospital and the patient's family. If the disease can be treated in a short time and the patient can recover as normal the amount of money is worth spending Otherwise, it is a great loss. In this case, euthanasia can help us solve the problem.  	Third, euthanasia should be put forward with legalization. Euthanasia is now quietly being practised in some urban areas of China despite a lack of legal protection for the death option. This situation is very dangerous, for it provides chances for crimes. So legal system in China should soon be established to deal with euthanasia lest some scoundrel perform killing for [fm1, -1] benifits, making use of euthanasia.   

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2>  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia is using the medical techniques to terminate an incurable patient's live [wd2, 1-] at his or her own will. After a long struggle, this process has been accepted and even legalized in some countries, which seems to be a tendency in the world. So should China, a country of the largest population follow suit or reject it out of the door?  	To answer this question, let me give an example first. Last year, Dengyin Chao [fm1,-], a famous revolutionists [np3, 1-] and the wife of the former Premier of the State Council ZhouEnLai ended her life tranquilly by [fm1, -1] Euthanasis. No pity, not [wd2, 1-] panic and no anguish, the reaction of the public just support, understanding and respect. It shows that in China many people including me are in favor of Euthanasis [fm1,-] and I think it should be legalized.  	Surely, Chinese are always attaching much importance to their lives. But there is also a famous saying in China --- to die happily and meaningfully is better than to live aimlessly and painfully. It coincides with the real purpose of Euthansis [fm1,-] which aims at relieving the great burden of the patients, and their folks, both phisically [fm1,-] and spiritually. Moreover, according to the status quo in China, China itself is also a great [fm1, -1] beneficiery. It's said that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year and this is undoubtedly a great problem in a poor country like China. Therefore, Euthansis [fm1,-] is quite significant not only for the individuals but also the whole nation.  	From the example of DengYinChao [fm1,-] we can know that Euthanasis [fm1,-] have [vp3, 1-] been applied somewhere in China. So now it's time for us to consider how to deal with it in our law. I want to remind you that since Euthansis [fm1,-] is not legalized in the United States, some unequal things happened----the Euphansis [fm1,-] operators, Lester M. Zygnamiak and Harold Mohor, were treated differently--one was acquited [fm1,-] while the other put into prison. So China may be faced with this dilemma without regalizing [fm1,-1] Euphansis. And various conflict and endless argue will probably crop up. Only a justified and considerable law can settle this.  	When we approve Euthanisis [fm1,-] in law, we [fm1, -1] certainlly should take other measures simultaneously, such as stengthening [fm1,-2] the criterias of [fm1, -1] Euphansis and educating people about the death etc. Only through this we can take precautions against the abuse, all in all, can guide Euthansis [fm1,-] in a positive way--- to guarantee the rights and benefit [vp1, 1-1] of the patients and their folks.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ?a??  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	In the Oxford English Dictionary, euthanasia is defined as " (bringing about of a ) mercifully easy and painless death ( for persons suffering from an incurable and painful disease ). It means artificially ending the life of persons who suffer from an incurable and painful disease. To be direct and simple, euthanasia can be called mercy killing. It has been accepted by many countries: Uruguay, Switzerland, Norway, and Germany have legalized euthanasia. Today, when it is introduced in China, it has aroused a fierce debate. In my opinion, we should legalize euthanasia in China because of the three following reasons.  	First, euthanasia is in line with the Chinese belief that one should live with dignity. This belief has given rise to the Chinese patriotism. Wen Tianxiang (???) offered us a good sample: he accepted his execution bravely, because he died for his country and only in this way, his dignity could be maintained When it is adapted to the medical sphere, this belief can also be effective. A terminally ill patient is no longer leading a human life because he is suffering from incurable and painful disease and what's more, any medical treatment will only mean prolonging their pain. In this case, "helping to hasten the death of him is humane".  	Second, "Views on death are changing in China, " and euthanasia corresponds well with the changing views. Nowadays, more and more Chinese people come to believe that "death is a normal and natural stage of life. " Thus, they look on the right to die as one of their indispensable rights. For example, "a survey of 200 old people shows that 92 percent do not fear death. "They do not want a long waiting period." Surely, they will be willing to accept euthanasia if they face "a long waiting period" before their painful and degraded death.  	Third, euthanasia means merciful and wise not only to the terminally ill patients themselves but to their friends and relatives. Just suppose how much one has to invest when his lover is suffering from an incurable and painful disease, both mentally and physically. In this sense, the patient's suffering is also his lover's suffering. For instance, the medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year. Such a large sum of money, to the people in the developing China, is a heavy burden. So, as the old Chinese saying goes, " a short pain is better than a long pain" euthanasia is a good way to release the meaningless burden of both the patients and their families.  	Generally speaking, euthanasia should be legalized in China because it is merciful both to the patients and to their families. To the patients, they can maintain their dignity and sacred rights. To their families, they can release themselves from meaningless pain and burdens.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ????(c)  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	In recent years, euthanasia has been more often used by doctors to help patients end their lives. This mercy killing arouse many arguements [fm1,-] in public. Even when the Courts deal with this kind of cases, they adopt different attitudes. The pronounce judgements [fm1,-] are usually not certain. After having read Dr. Sanders' Case, I do not agree with Reverend Billy Graham that "Dr Sanders should be punished as an example". Because he, in fact, has not murdered anyone.[sn2,s] And in China, euthanasia should be legalized, too, because of a combination of reasons.  	First, China is still a developing country. Compared with those developed countries like America, China is still not rich. The average level of people's life is relatively low. Most Chinese are not of wealth. In addition, China's medical skills are not as advanced as America. In order to prolong the life of patients who have no hope to survive and recover, we have to import some expensive medicines from foreign countries. This will be no doubt to increase the burden of the hospital the patient's family and even the country. In the end, the patient still have to die. For those rich people, they surely can afford the cost, while those who are not rich may be deep in debt. And also they suffer from the loss of their parents or children. Second, through the whole course of medical treatment, the patient has to suffer form pain. The endless pain will torture him so cruelly that it is a great relief to the patient himself and his family if he dies with the help of euthanasia. Chinese people pay so much attention to their family relation that they can do anything to save their family member who is on the edge of death. Some people in order to get enough money to pay the cost of medical treatment,[sn2,s] they will commit a crime. In contrast with that if they do not need to pay the expensive cost they will not commit a crime. Third, China has a great population. There are people who are very poor, and the country also need [vp3,2-] to be developed to compete with the other countries. If we save the money from those patients who are beyone [fm1,-] hope, we can use the money in other ways. For example, to invest more money to backward mountain areas and help people get rid of poverty. Hence the country will grow stronger and become more powerful than before.  	But it does not mean that the euthanasia can be abused. It can be used only when a thorough examination is made of the patient's physical condition and of the effect of further medical treatment and used under the request of the patient. Thus, euthanasia should be legalized to prevent it from being misued [fm1,-] or used indiscriminately.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> 3????  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia is a newly-emerged phenomenon in recent decades and it has aroused heated-argument around the world.  	Euthanasia(mercy killing) is a complicated issue. It is closely related to law and ethics. When dealing with it, we should be prudent. In foreign countries many cases of mercy killing led to legal disputes. The most famous Mercy killing ease [fm1,-] in America history involved Dr. Herman N. Sanders, a country doctor from new Hampshire, He ended his patient's life on the strong request of his patient. After a long and tiring trial, he was announced innocent. Mr. Zygnamiak killed his older brother and Mrs Ross killed her daughter because her daughter was born seriously deformed. They were put on to the court, both turned out be innocent. However, there was exception, Harold Mohar of Pennsylvania [fm3,-], involved in a similar case, he was founded guilty and sentenced to prison and imposed a fine. All these cases seem to give us an information [np5,1-] that Mercy Killing has been widely accepted in other countries. It is regarded as a legal act.  	With the development of medical technology, people can lengthen their [fm1, -1] lifes, but is it a good thing to extend human suffering when 'a patient is in a helpless situation. I think man should have right to choose to die when he feels that life can no longer brings him peace, joy and happiness. To the patient's relative [np6, s-] it surely will break their hearts when they see the patient struggling in an extremely painful situation. Mercy killing will be a final resort.  	In today's China, people are not wealthy. To maintain a patient's life including use of medication and life-support systems, it will cost a lot. It is a heavy burden to both government and the patient's family. Chinese people hesitate to accept this. In their traditional saying: debt is better than death. Now, it is time to change this concept.  	Mercy killing can end the pain of terminally ill patients and can also be a great relief to their family members, both mentally and physically. In present, Maybe it is still not ripe for drawing up laws for euthanasia. I am sure, this day is not far away.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> o?(c)?  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia is the painless killing of people who are incurably ill or very old. There are a number of cases that people commit mercy killing in the world, and cause constant controversies over different opinions.  	Some people think that anyone who voluntarily, knowingly or premeditatedly takes the life of another, even one minute prior to death, is a killer. Sometimes there is still a chance for the patients to survive, although the patient himself want [vp3,2-]to die. We should not give up even one minute prior to death.  	But most cases indicate that numorous [fm1,-] people support the behavior of mercy killing. Painful living is more terrible than death And a survey of 200 people shows that 92% do not fear death. Euthnasia [fm1,-] is a way for people incurable [sn8,s] ill to release from pain.  	In China, even Deng Yingchao, widow of former Premire [fm1,-] Zhou Enlai, said that she is very much in favor of mercy killing as a practical concept. When a patient cannot stand the life being incurable ill and wishes to die, it is humane to help him Because man lives in the earth is to provide the services for others and found themselves from it, they live not for pain. But at this moment, to last their lives is meaningless and give a heavy burden to their families, to the society. And we human beings could not bear to see our dear friends, our relatives live in physical and mental agony.  	In fact, Chinese people should receive some necessary death education. Birth and death, both are natural stages of life. In Buddhism, birth and death are not of great importance, it advocates man should observe the truth but not be bound by those two fact. Perhaps this view is a little passive, but death is inevitable, we should not be too careless of it or be too afraid of it.  	Euthanasia is a problem we must treat prudently. An effective legal system should be established. When we judge the cases of mercy killing, we should certainly obey the law, but humanism and people's emotion are also two factors that we must consider. Many countries have legalized mercy killing. Chinese people have been influenced by the traditional culture for thousands of year [np3, 1-] which suggest humanity, justice and virture [fm1,-]  	So we Chinese can accept the Euthanasia [fm3, 1-] and we can find a good way to deal with this problem legally. Euthanasia should be legalized in China to release people from suffering incurably ill and too old when themselves their families, the doctors all think [sn8,s] them will surely die.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ??"??  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Life is too precious to be treated lightly. In China, longevity is traditionally a good luck of people. But since euthanasia as a new word, [vp6, -1] appeared in people's mind, their views upon life and death have somewhat altered.  	Still, Chinese people believe that life is to be cherished. They all know how uneasy the birth and growth of a new life are, 10-month pregrancy [fm1,-] and over-10-year education, during this course, countless love and effort are devoted to the life. Why will they not avoid death as best as they can? But to the terminally ill patients, it is another case. Suffering from torturious [fm1,-] pain, they prefer to end their lives painlessly than prolong artificially by medical technology. Therefore, euthanasia appeared [vp6,s-] as mercy killing. The most famous mercy killing case in America's history involves Dr. [fm3, -1] herman N. Sanders, who gave his dying patient four lethal injections of air to put an end to her misery. Although he stood trail at court, he gained lots of support and was acquitted later.  	In large majority of people's eyes, euthanasia is humane and should be put into practice through a legal way.  	 Considering the suffering patients, euthanasia is a great relief to their souls and bodies. Since life had [vp6,s-1] lost its meaning, by which they taste no sweetness but pain and misery, why not put a painless end to it? A survey of 200 old people shows that 92 percent do not fear death. They do not want a long waiting period. they [fm3,-] want to die with dignity and peace, instead of agony and degradation. Euthanasia is a progressive way to die, said a report in Beijing Daily.  	Meanwhile, mercy killing is a great relief to hospital [np6, 1-] and the relatives of the patients. According to the ethical codes in China, the family members should never abandon their ill folks. Even though they know there is no hope, they still tried [vp6,s-] every means to prolong their folks' lives. Even when the patients ask for mercy killing, they won't do that It is indeed a great burdon [fm1,-] mentally and physically. Once the mercy kill [wd2, 1-] is legalized, such as [sn8,s] situation will be improved immensely.  	By now, many countries have legalized mercy killing. In Uruguary [fm1,-] the law states that, "The judges are authorized to forgo punishment of a person whose life has been honorable where he commits a homicide motivated by compassion induced by repeated requests by the victim." Switzerland, Norway, and Germany have adopted similar approaches. In China, the question of euthanasia raises serious moral issues. But since there always comes a time when we'd be better off dead, euthanasia has become necessary to be legalized.  	Although there is still a long way to go for euthanasia to be widely accepted, and there will be lots of difficulties in the way of the legalization of mercy killing [sn9, s] I [fm3, 1-] believe that with the efforts of our people and careful consideration of the legal governments, a better treatment of death can be attained in the near future.

It's a kind of mercy killing by scientific means. It eliminates a [np7, 1-] incurable patient's pain by hastening his death. As far as the situations in China are concerned, euthanasia should be legalized.  	 From the angle of benevolence, euthanasia is the best remedy for the incurable patients who have suffered a lot Maybe in the past, people follow [vp6,s-] the old moral code of filial [fm1, -1] obidience. They considered more about the code instead of the feeling of the patient's lives. In some degrees, they were expanding the patient's anguish. But nowadays, people's opinion [np6,-] are changing. They come to know that euthanasia is the best choice for the tortured patient. As we can see especially for the old patients, they have experienced the joys and sorrows in their lives. They fear no more about death. However, they can't bear the torment they are suffered form their illnesses. Therefore, euthanasia is a relief for them. On the other hand, for some disabled bodies such as Paula mentioned in the material.[sn2,s] She may live an arduous life for all her defects She may confront the pressure and anguish physically and spiritually. As a result, euthanasia is better than alive for her.  	In regards [pp2, 1-] to the economic aspects in China, Euthanasia [fm3, 1-] is [sn8,s] coincide with the situations in China. As we all know, China is a developing country. Although the living standards in China has [vp3,3-] been improved, the expensive medical fees is still a big burden for a family. What's more, the money you have spent may not result in any progress of the patient's health. To some extends, they are spending money in perpetuating the patient's pain. Therefore it's a burden for both the family and the patient.  	It is not all, for the country, it's also a big burden. We all know that China is a socialistic country. The medical welfare system is a major characteristic of the country. For this reason, the country [vp3, -1] have to spend a large sum of money in supporting the patients who have no sense of themselves and those who are within the hour of death. In some degrees, if this sum of money is used in other aspect, it may accelerate the development of the country.  	Therefore, euthanasia is in [wd7, -1] avoidance with China's economic situations for both family and country.  	What's more, with the development in science, euthanasia is available in China.  	In a word, euthanasia is identified with the thoughts and the economic situations in China. It should be legalized in China.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ???  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Helping to hasten the death of a terminally ill patient is called euthanasia, or Mercy [fm3,-] Killing [fm3,-]. It is believed to be humane by a lot of people that we shorten and reduce the pain a [np7, 1-] incurable patients [np3, 1-] has to suffer. Since people are born equal, enjoying various rights and freedom. Why can't we determine the way of death by ourselves? Death is nothing terrifying but natural and normal. Once the fire of life has come to go out, we'd rather close our eyes with smile and dignity than bring heart-breaking sensation and feeling to whom love us so much.  	From dozens of examples from abroad, we might realize that Mercy killing has no longer been a taboo in reality. People are more rational than ever before to consider using it despite considerable opposite condemns.  	Most importantly, the practice of Mercy [fm3,-] Killing [fm3,-] has to base on the change in ethics, and also to require the recognizition [fm1,-] of society. Especially in China, in which moral and ethic [fm1, -1] tradictions have a long history and a deep-rooted social and cultural background. It would be crude of us to eyewitness an alive person being deprived of life, although we completely understand that it is the best way for himself and everyone around him.  	Decision [sn8,s] that we respect the litigant's choice is painful. Taking the pressure from our living environment and social opinions is also unbearable as well.  	The direct problem is not Euthanasia [fm3, 1-] itself but something beyond. It is self-evident that everyone knows the avantages [fm1,-] of this and its merits. But it isn't enough at all. Only after the whole society has reached a common [fm1, -1] recognision that Mercy killing is as common as pills or medicines to cure flu can we calmly and boldly maintain the honorable human fame and reputation for birth and death.  	So to speaking, euthanasia should be legalized in China. In the form of written law, people may enjoy the free option. Moreover, personal choice that abides by law will not be changed by other factors. And the legalization of euthanasia will help people ajust [fm1,-] their attitudes gradually. It may not be easy, to be frank and we still have a long way to go. But we believe that the legalization of euthanasia will being more to our life than its medical use and physical comfort. Its compacts go far beyond this.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> o"?  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	For nearly half a centure [fm1,-] Euthanasia [fm3, 1-] or mercy killing has aroused a great sensation throughout the world. Thus, it has become one of the heat [wd2, 1-] topics in the modern world as well as in China.  	Mercy killing can hasten the death of hopelessly ill individuals by withholding life-sustaining procedures so that death will occur naturally and quickly. In a word, it is a means of helping hopeless people to die painlessly and peacefully. However, should it be promoted? Many people are against it. They consider mercy killing as a kind of murder for no one has the right to take away others' lives. This is common case in China, too. Therefore, Euthanasia [fm3, 1-] is quietly being practised in some urban areas of China, but not openly.  	In my opinion, I think Euthanasia [fm3, 1-] should be permitted and legalized in China. First, it is the request and the right of a dying person. We all agree that every one has the right to live and no one will throw doubt upon this. However, we seldom realized [vp6,s-] that people are also entitled to the right to die. It is one of the human rights. Death, said Cai Wenmei, an associate professor at the Institute of Population At Beijing University, is as natural as birth and, like birth, is sometimes a hard process requiring assistance. He is absolutely right. When a person is suffering from extreme pains and stands little chance of living, how can you bear to look at him? And, if you were him, what would you do? You may probably ask for death. One moment of prolonging his or her life can only bring him or her more pains. Second, it is a great burden both mental and physical, for the patient's life without bringing him to life. On the other hand, it can only bring more sorrow to the family. So, it is unnecessary to artificially maintain life beyond the point when people can never regain consciousness.  	Nowadays, Mercy killing has been acknowledged by many countries and legal systems have been established to deal with Euthanasia [fm1,-] in these countries. China should follow suit. Most authorized Chinese favor mercy killing but many still consider it inhumane Thus before laws are drawn up for euthanasia we have to have these people accept [sn8,s] it. There is still a long way for us to go.

Mercy killing can hasten the death of hopelessly ill individuals by withholding life-sustaining procedures so that death will occur naturally quickly and painlessly.  	It is unnecessary to artificially maintain life beyond the point when people can never regain consciousness. Euthanasia can end the pain of terminally ill patients.  	Statistics indicate that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year, a heavy burden for the hospital and the patient's family. Euthanasia can be a great relief to the family members, both mentally and physically.  	Hospital and family members should respect the dying patient's rights in regard to choices about lifestyle, including death.  	But the practice of euthanasia faces a lot of problems. And any form of murder might be conveniently dubbed "mercy killed" by unscrupulous persons. How to make euthanasia properly legalized?  	The general adoption of the practice of euthanasia would require changes in ethics and this should happen only after the issue is carefully considered by society. [fm1, -1] Eduation on death should be advocated.  	Laws on euthanasia should be worked out to protect the practice. Mercy killing should be performed only at the patient's request, with the consent of his relatives and the signature of a lawyer.  	It would not be right for medical personnel or family members to casually assume that a patient is beyond hope until a thorough examination is made of his physical condition and of the effect of further medical treatment.  	Hospital should require the patient's family members to request the induced death in writing and have joint approval of all medical personnel attending the case in order to avoid legal [fm1,-] problems.  	Legal system should establish an evaluation body to judge which requests for a mercy killing are valid before the act is committed.  	China is still a developing country. People are not rich enough to afford expensive expenditure on some medical treatment. If the patient do suffer and will not recover again. Why not carry out euthanasia as early as possible?  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ?3/42  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia, or mercy killing can hasten the death of hopelessly suffering patients by withholding life-sustaining procedures so that death will occur naturally. When hospitals have taken all kinds of measures to prolong the patients' life but have failed, when the ill individuals can't bear their anguish any more and claim their natural death, when patients can't regain their consciousness and their family members agree to their death, it is very natural to allow legalized [fm3, -1] Euthanasia in China.  	The practice of mercy killing in China will meet a lot of difficulties because of the existence of traditional value systems and morals. Most Chinese regard death as a [np7, 1-] evil thing. In western countries, Christians believe that they will enter heaven and meet relatives and friends there after their death. There [fm1,-] funerals don't exist the atomosphere [fm1,-] of sadness usually in Chinese funerals. While China doesn't have a strong religious perspective.[sn2,s] Death is an unknown world. Traditional suspicions [fm1,-] belief is that the underground is full of terrible ghosts People die with fear. There is an old saying in China "bad living is better than good death" which reflects the traditional value root in Chinese culture.  	But we have come to a new era. The traditional old-fashioned values should be abandoned There exists a [np7,1 -] irresistable [fm1,-] life law. That is people will die eventually. No one can escape the fate of death. To prolong an incurable patient's life is just an action of wasting the time and money of hospitals and the patient's family members. When a patient can't suffer his pain any more and choose mercy death, we should respect his individual will and stop the artificial life-sustaining. There is only ever-lasting spirit but not ever-lasting lives of human beings. Birth and death are just two different phases-- the beginning and the end. When you have finished your life task and have enjoyed the happiness of your life, then you can enjoy another happiness--death.  	Everything has two sides. Euthanasia also can cause problems to our society. For example, if a murderer gets the Euthanasia [fm3, 1-] permission certification, then his murder will become legal. So laws on euthanasia to protect the practice should be made.  	Though difficulties and problems will follow with the practice of mercy killing. Euthanasia should still be legalized in China.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ?D???  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia is a new term emerged in the modern times. Facing great anguish, patients with incurable diseases may prefer to death. But how do we think of it and deal with the action that helps the patients end their torturous pain? So rises a question, [sn2,s] euthanasia should be legalized.  	There are not yet clear principles or justified concept to evaluate euthanasia in the world. Some people support euthanasia, saying it is a merciful release to dying people while some people consider it as an inhumane behavior and the people who apply to euthanasia should be punished by law. In the world, most of people who helped their patients or relatives with fatal illness to die were released by law, but still some of them were considered guity [fm1,-] Cr. Sanders, Lester Zygnamiak, Mrs. Ross are [vp6,s-] all the people with their behavior admitted by law, but Harold Mohar of Pennsylvania was convicted of voluntary manslaughter for killing his blind, cancer-stricken brother and sentenced to prison. Different people or nations have different views on euthanasia. Some countries in the world have put forth laws to treat the problem of euthanasia in a right way, such as Uruguay, the U.S.A, Switzerland, Norway, and Germany.  	In China, euthanasia is also quietly being practised in some urban areas despite a lack of legal protection for the death option. Euthanasia should be legalized in China. Firstly, birth and death are both natural things. According to Cai Wenmei, an associate professor at the Institute of Population of Beijing University, death should not be viewed as a failure, but as a normal and natural stage of life. People have the right to die which can be regarded as a wholesome concept of human beings. Although the concept in China will require complicated changes, the law for euthanasia should be drawn up quickly to legalize it. Secondly, it's unnecessary to artificially maintain life beyond the point when people can never regain consciousness. Helping to hasten the death of terminally ill patients is humane. Death is as natural as birth, like birth, is sometimes a hard process requiring assistance. No one would deny that long life is a good thing---provided one enjoys perfect health. But is it a good thing to extend human suffering, to prolong life, not in order to give joy and happiness, but to give pain and sorrow? Does anybody want to see their dear relatives or friends painfully put up a last-ditch struggle? In this sense, it's totally inhumane. With regard to senility, it might be preferable to let nature take its course when death will relieve suffering. Thirdly, to legalize the euthanasia can prevent the abuse of euthanasia. Without official approvement [fm2, 1-] and standard, the abuse of euthanasia can not be controlled and removed. Proper dimensions are not easy to grasp. After all, euthanasia should be legalized in China. It's good to both patients themselves and their families. However, euthanasia should be performed only at the patients's [fm1,-] request; with the consent of his relatives and the signature of a lawyer.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ??3?  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	It is unnecesssary [fm1,-] to artificially maintain or prolong life beyond the point when people can never regain consciousness. Hopelessly ill individuals should have their rights to die. For the sake of the patient, the family and the whole human race, euthanasia should be thoroughly accepted [sn8,s] bases on laws. According to China, it also should be accepted.  	Mercy killing is quietly practised in some areas of China despite a lack of legal protection for the death option. Because in dealing with these kind [np3,1-] of unremediable [fm1,-] patients, to prolong or maintain their lives, many problems are generated. In the patient's side, extending an incurable ill patient's life means the same as aggravating his pain. For example, Lester's brother George who would probably paralyzed for life and would never walk again, Lseater, as the best he can do is to put an end to his brother's miserable life. Another euthanasia is carryed [fm1,-] out by Mrs. Ross. Her daughter Paula was born severely disfigured: had no arms or legs and her face was badly deform [vp9, 5-] She was totally deaf and had her very poor vision, while her normal intelligence would only make her more cruelly aware of her fate. To send her to heaven is the best solution. The existence of the incurably ill patients not only cause [vp3,8-] pain to themselves, but also to their family and society. Their family [np3, 1-] have to burden not only mental but economic responsibilities. According to the statistics, the medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year, a heavy burden for the hospital and the patient's family. Spending a huge sum of money on the meaningless things is a great waste. China should accept euthanasia.  	When comes to the point of human rights, natural rights should not only include equality, freedom...but also the right to die. In the past, people misunderstood death as a failure; but to modern concepts, death should be viewed as a normal and natural stage of life. In this angle, like birth, is sometimes a hard process requiring assistance, why don't death? Toward various angles of death, does doctor ask the patient to maintain or prolong their lives? In generally speaking, death should be regard [vp9, 2-] and legalized as a natural right; when coming across the problem of death, we should respect the requirement of the patient.  	Maybe, accepting euthanasia, there is a long way to go When euthanasia is legalized, many problems must be protected from [sn8,s] happen. Abuse is the most severe one. Because most of the patients who ask for a [np7,1-] euthanasia are the unconscious ones, it may give space for the crimes to happen. Any form of murder might be convenientally [fm1,-] dubbed "mercy killing" by unscrupulous people. In response, when legal system is established to protect the practice.  	As time went on, many countries have legalized mercy killing, to the good of the patient, the family and human race, euthanasia should also be legalized in China.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> D?D?  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia or mercy killing means that a doctor or doctors end the patient's life at the patient's repeated request to ease the agony and degradation [sn8,s] painless, it should be with the consent of his relatives. China is still a developing country with undeveloped medical technique. Some diseases can not be cured and some patients are suffering from congenital malformation, like born without arms and legs and destroyed face etc. Country, hospital and family have to spend much to prolong their lives just because of traditional concept of human, extending an incurably ill patient's life means a heavy burden not only to the hospital and family but also to the patient himself. Death is as natural as birth, and is a normal and natural stage of life. People have the right to die, to ease their extreme pain and hopeless lives. The traditional views of death in China is [vp3,5-] debt is better than death, and helping others to die is immoral and criminal. And Chinese like to pay much attention to the old people in their families.  	Changing concepts is not easy. As time goes by society and the education [sn8,s] develope [fm1,-] the society will accept the mercy killing gradually. In fact, according to the survey, more than 90 percent of extremely ill patients like to ease their lives painlessly and peacefully. Deng Ying Chao, widow of former Premier Zhou Enlai, said that she is very much in favour of mercy killing as a practical concept. Euthanasia can end the pain of terminally ill patients and can also be a great relief to their family members, both mentally and physically.  	Many countries have legalized mercy killing, including Uruguay, Switzerland, Norway, and Germany. Legalization of mercy killing is not only the need of the patients but also the need of developing country. China now has entered into the period of old-structure tendency society. More old people appear, who are prolonged painful lives by medical technique which cost a lot. Our country is in the urgent need of developing economy, which can not waste much time and money in treating the hopeless extremely ill patients.  	We came to the world happily, and should go back happily when we can not enjoy the life any more. Legalization of euthanasia should be established in order to better treat our lives and protect from abusing or murder.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ?"a1  	Euthanasia is quite new a phenomenon in China although it has been practiced in some cities despite the absence of legal protection. It should have legal protection considering the nature of Euthanasia [fm3, 1-] and the relief and benifits [fm1,-] subsequently brought by the death.  	Euthanasia, also called mercy killing, is [wd4, s] way to hasten the death of a person, who is terminally ill. In choosing euthanasia, a terminately [fm1,-] ill person can die quietly and painlessly. And it's the only way out for him as he is incurable and in great agony. At this time, the patient life means only suffer and agony to him and the right to death becomes very important. The right should not be ignored as "extending an incurable ill patient's life means the same as aggravating his pain". Carrying out [fm3, -1] Euthanasia may seems to be a bit cruel, but seeing a helpless patient's struggle in agony is unbearable. Euthanasia is appropriate at this time.  	Then, the death of a patient who is incurable and in agony may bring a relief to the rest of the family. Seeing the kin's pain, the rest of the family members may feel desperate and above all broken-hearted. Yet they can not help. If an infirm member of the family gets over-sorrowful, he may be beat down. The patient certainly does not want to see that happen. Furthermore, the cost of the medical treatment may become a heavy burden to the family. As the patient is incurable, why should the patient and the rest of the family fight a losing battle, which brings only pain and suffering? So it's quite obvious that only euthanasia can do the patient's family good as it enables the family to get time to get rid of the pain in their hearts.  	Furthermore, Euthanasia [fm3, 1-] is more important to China than it to other countries. China is the most populous country in the world. Over-population imposes a [fm1, -1] threast to the development of the nation. Enhencing [fm1,-] the quality of the whole people is vital to the modernization drive. But enhencing [fm1,-] the quality needs [fm1, -1] finacial support. The money saved by carrying euthanasia can be used to help the curable and the medical research work. But I'm not suggesting to follow the law of the jungle and to get rid of the infirm, as euthanasia is based on humanism. We carry out euthanasia in the hope that we will save money to improve our medical work and thus to find a way to cure the now-seemingly-incurable patients. Knowing this, I'm sure that the patients died of euthanasia would be in more comfort if they could feel in their afterlife.  	In summing up, China should legalize euthanasia as it will only do good to the people and the nation.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ????1/4  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia, which means a good death, should be legalized in China.  	As we all know, some patients suffer great pain without any hope of being cured, such as cancer patient. Not only the patients themselves, but also their relatives, friends suffer great pain, and have to pay a lot of money. Statistics indicate that medical treament [fm1,-] for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year, a heavy burden for the hospital and the patients' family. Now our country is still a developing country, and our people are not wealthy yet. It is unreasonable to take so much money to save those hopeless life, while the survivor lead a poor life. The patients don't want to do so too. So they often choose to commit suicide. In that case, euthanasia is a kind of release to the patients and their relatives.  	In another way, both birth and death are natural events. People have the right to die. A survey in China shows that of 200 old people 92 percent do not fear death. They do not want a long waiting period. They want to die with dignity and peace, instead of agony and degradation. As a report in Beijing Daily said, euthanasia is a progressive way to die.  	Some may feel that legalized euthanasia would invite abuse. In fact, our legal system can establish an evaluation body to judge which requests for a mercy killing are valid before the act is committed. And actually, euthanasia is quietly being practised in some urban areas of our country. If we do not legalize it as soon as possible, it will become under control and things turn to be more difficult to deal with.  	Many countries have legalized euthanasia, such as Uruguay, Switzerland, Norway, and Germany. And many cases about euthanasia like Dr. Sanders shows that people perfer [fm1,-] to choose euthanasia. According to China's specific condition, euthanasia should be legalized in China.   

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> 3?  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia, or mercy killing should be legalized in China for the sake of the nation, the patient's family and the patients themselves athough [fm1,-] Euthanasia [fm3, 1-] whether it should be legalized or not has evoked an intense argument in the whole world.  	In terms of our national conditions at present, Euthanasia [fm3, 1-] is an effective way to release the heavy burden imposed on the nation. As we all know, China, a developing country with its large number of population is struggling along the road towards nation's [fm1, -1] properity and civilization. Now, in this period, our main duty is to speed up the development process of economic construction and reduce unnecessary expenditure. However, statistics indicate that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year, that means our country puts a great deal of money on the patients who have no chance for recovery. And it is no more than throwing the money into the sea for there would be no wonder occurred [fm1,-]. Not, of course, that a nation should not save a patient in despair, but money and resources should be used in a more efficient way to help the people who are really in need and have the hope for existence.  	Second, the legalized Euthanasia [fm3, 1-] is a great relief to the patient's family members, both mentally and [fm1, -1] phsically. Besides with the patients themselves, their families members are also suffered by their endless medical treatment, such as taking care of the patients in the hospital all days and nights, borrowing money all around and being afraid of the death's coming at any time. All of these heavy burdens make the patient's family worn out so that they also need a good way to release their incessant suffering.  	Third, the legalized Euthanasia [fm3, 1-] is also suitable for the willings [np5, 1-] of the patients themselves. Nowadays, Chinese views on death have been changing that they want to die with dignity and peace instead of agony and degradation. In the face of the death, owing to the people consider death as a normal and natural stage of life, they don't fear death any longer as before. Instead, they think people should have the right to die in the condition that they already have no chance to choose birth. On the other hand, the modern people quite put a high value upon their vitues [fm1,-] of their [np5, -1] existences. So when they lie on the bed, being kept alive by artificial means for an indefinite period, they would rather choose death for it will give them dignity and happiness to end their meaningless lives as quick [wd2, 1-] as possible.  	For the reason I was speaking just now, whatever kinds of angles were taken, individuals or collectivity [fm1,-] Euthanasia should be legalized in China to fit the benefits of China and Chinese.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ??  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia or mercy killing, so-called "a good death" is very popular in many western countries. Nowadays with the development of economy, many new concepts are introduced into China accompanied by the open policy. Among them, "euthanasia" is one of those special examples which still causes heat [wd2, 1-] controversy.  	To the euthanasia, different people have different opinions. Some people think euthanasia is innocence for its purpose is to help to hasten the death of terminally ill patients. But the others say it is guilty because it deprives of human being's right to live on. In fact, both them are right. Obviously when an ill patient is terminal and has to depend on medicine to continue life and at the same time he has to endure great misery every day, at this case, use another way to hasten his death without any pain according to patient's will be better. In addition, it can release the hospital and the family's heavy burden. But one thing we may notice that is in China there aren't any laws to protect or against euthanasia. Therefore it's condemned to raise many unexpected questions.  	First, euthanasia means according to patient's will choosing another way to hasten patient's death without any pain. But, who knows the so-called mercy killing is not deliberate if there is no clear law to protect it? Because the cost of the medical treatment for a comatose patient is so heavy burden for the patient's family. [sn2,s] Although Chinese economy is developing quickly, there are many poor families. Maybe some form of murder might be conveniently dubbed "mercy killing " by unscrupulous persons. [sn8,s] 	Secondly, if euthanasia isn't legalized, those people help the helpless patient to a good death may be regarded as murders. So that a series of questions will arise. [sn2,s] 	Thirdly, every one has right to choose live [wd2, 1-2] or die, the traditional saying "debt is better than death" in fact is not so scientific. It is unnecessary to artificially maintain life beyond when people can never regain consciousness. This new view on death is practising in China. But there is still a long way to go for euthanasia to be widely and orderly accepted and practised. To make the euthanasia humane and protect people's will of living or death, to protect the social stability euthanasia should be legalized in China.

It had engendered such a great controversy that even the judge was hesistating [fm1,-] in dispensing justice. It is time that people should attach some importance to this "mercy killing". Considering the law of life, the humanity, Chinese current situations, euthanasia should be granted legality.  	There is no denying that death is the destination of all fresh [fm1,-]. There is no object or appeal in the law of life. According to Cai Wenmei, an associate professor at the Institute at [wd6, 1-2] the Institute of Population at Beijing University. "Death should not be viewed as a failure, but as a normal and natural stage of life," " People have the right to die." Man as an intellectual animal, has definitely undergone a prudent consideration before he takes to the road of death. What will define a phenomenon that [sn8,s] pleading with others to deprive one's life. It is stuck between murder and suicide. But the aim is same, as it is, death. Wrongly or rightly, death can not be avoided and can be in charge by individuals.  	Man is immoral. But love can bring happiness to man's immoral life and reduce the grief. So does [sn8,s] it can make man's last few minutes less painful. Common to other countries, China stresses on humanity, especially to a dying person or a useless [wd3, 1-] baby. They suffer as much as the patient himself. Such as Anna Marie Ross, who gave birth to a deaf, poor-visioned, serious-deformed baby. what [fm3,-] can she deal with it? It is bound to resort to euthanasia for the baby's life in the future will be full of anguish. In addition, to take euthanasia is not necessary equal to marching for tragedy. To relieve may be another alternative. When the pain has become extremely unendurable, it is no more than a crime to withhold life sustaining procedures. About 92 percent people who accepted a survey want to die with dignity and peace instead of agony and degradation.  	If humanity, the human nature, permits the probability of euthanasia, Chinese current situations may add more to the possibility of this practice. The level of Chinese economic developement [fm1,-] is much lower than other developed country. The heavy burdon [fm1,-] of population is still a tough problem and to afford the expense of more and more incurable patients is a much more arduous task than other countries. As a result, it is urgent for China to legalize euthanasia. What's more, China is a target that is condemned on the subject of human rights. If we don't take measures in legislation [wd6, 1-] in terms of euthanasia, it is as good as waiting for another bullet.  	All in all, given the three factors, euthanasia should not be treated as an inhuman behavior or a cruel crime. It should be looked upon as normal thing and conducted carefully.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ??  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	My great-grand mother who was over 80 when I was ten years old, lived in my hometown in a comfortable way. But happiness does not always last long. One day in 1985, we recieved [fm1,-] a letter from the home town, telling us that my great-grand mother had passed away. The letter told us that recently she got a fall from the stairs and couldn't move any more. Everything she wanted to do should be helped to be done by others. This is the first time that the independent woman had to depend on others to survive in a painful way. She realized it and decided not [wd4, s] be a burden of the family. Since then, she refused eating and drinking any more, till finally she closed her eyes. We were surprised at the news. This is the first time that makes me wonder why people want to die even if he still have [vp3,2-] the chance to survive! One could not control his birth, but could he control his death!  	The idea of euthanasia or mercy killing, which means "bring about of a mercifully easy and painless death for persons suffering from an incurable and painful disease,"(Oxford Dictionary), has been introduced into China for a long time. Although the idea hasn't been established in legal system, yet people pay more and more attention on it. It has aroused a great disputation in foreign countries and it has been a popular topic on the lips of Chinese. Life is beautiful, with happiness and joys; Life is cruel, with sorrows and pain. Since we can share the happiness, can we end the sorrow once we could no longer get joys? Euthanasia, in my point of view, is acceptable.  	First, to a patient who has got an incurable disease, lying painfully on the bed, will have no willings [np5, 1-] to enjoy the colorful life. What he wants and all he wants to do is to put an end of this unberable [fm1,-] sufferings. To him, life is meaningless and to hasten the death of his life is the best choice. This is sensible and reasonable. Privious [fm1,-] cases have also shown us that these patients want to die quickly and peacefully in a dignity way.  	Second, to the patients relatives and friends, watching the one who they love so deep suffering in an endlessly painful illness do not taste good. They know that their dear is just waiting for death in pain and they don't want him suffer any more. As the mother who killed her severely disfigured daughter said that she did it because "I love her".  	Third, besides the emotional human feelings [sn9, s] "Statistics indicate that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year, a heavy burden for the hospital and the patient's family." Maintaining a life in an artificial way will just bring pain to the patients and wastes to the hospital.  	Fourth, "death should not be viewed as a failure, but as a normal and natural stage of life." And helping to hasten the death of terminally ill patients is humane. Euthanasia is just a progressive way to die.  	However, people have different opinions. Many people still do not accept mercy killy [fm1,-] for they still "consider it inhumane to perform mercy killing for a patient, no matter how painless. They claim that it will waste many curable persons lifes [fm2,-] and prevents [vp6,s-] the science from advancing. Except few countries as Uruguay, Switzerland and Norway etc [sn9, s] most countries still do not leagalize [fm1,-] euthanasia.  	Also, in China, mercy killing is still illegal, for we still do not have the right preparation for it. According to Beijing Daily, the concept will require complicated changes and the education on death should be advanced Only after that, euthanasia should be legalized in China.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ??  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia, or mercy killing is a newly developed medical practice in modern life. It can "hasten the death of hopelessly ill individuals by withholding life-sustaining procedures so that death will occur naturally and quickly." This practice leads to a world-wide controversy Some people are strongly against it, thinking that the practice of euthanasia is a kind of inhumane murder. But the majority of the surveyed people are for this practice, considering it a relief for patients and their families. No matter how the controversy is going on, it seems that more and more people begin to accept euthanasia, either the patients themselves or the public. Many countries have legalized it, such as Uruguay, Switzerland, Norway and Germany.  	Euthanasia is also quietly being practised in some urban areas of China. In order to make euthanasia more beneficial and lawfully and properly practised by Chinese people, it should be legalized in China.  	Euthanasia can release the patients [np4,-] pain. Medical science is succeeding brilliantly in extending human life and curing all kinds of [fm1, -1] diceases. But there are still many things that medical science is unable to do. When a patient is hopeless to recover, it is not a good thing to extend his or her suffering by artificial means. Many patients who are suffering from unbearable anguish ask for death. Chinese people consider death a natural event, just like birth. A survey of 200 old people shows the 92 percent of them do not fear death. They do not want a long waiting period, wanting to die with dignity and peace instead of agony and degradation. Mercy killing is a peaceful way for those sufferers to end their suffering.  	Euthanasia can help to release the heavy burden of the patients' family members. Statistics indicate that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year, which is a big figure for most Chinese families. We can often see in hospitals that some patients and their families don't know what to do because they have no ability to afford the expensive medical treatment, some even have to borrow a lot of money for it. The patients feel hopeless, their families feel helpless. " Euthanasia can end the pain of terminally ill patients and can also be a great relief to their family members, both mentally and physically."  	However, legalzing [fm1,-] euthanasia is not an easy task, requiring the efforts of the government and people themselves. Laws on euthanasia should be made out in order to protect the death option and the practice. The dying persons should have the right to choose euthanasia and hospitals and family members should respect it. And the practice should be performed only at the patient's request with the consent of his relatives and the signature of a lawyer. However, the controversy will go on; changes are required inethics [fm1,-]  	Euthanasia should be legalized in China, for it is good for those dying patients who suffer from inbearable [fm1,-] pains and their family members. At the same time, the goverment [fm1,-] should make efforts to protect it.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ??  	Since the case of Dr. Herman N. Sanders, the issue of Euthanasia [fm3, 1-] has raised many discussions: is it legal or not? Considering the fact that euthanasia is good to the patient, good to his or her families and good to country, I think euthanasia should be legalized in China.  	Euthanasia is to help hastening the death of terminally ill patients and to put a peaceful end to the patients' suffering lives. According to this definition, euthanasia is a great help to patients, which can not be [fm1, -1] critized. Death is a natural thing as well as birth, but because of the influence of the tradition, death is often avoided as best one can. In China there is an old saying that debt is better than death. However, when one's life is filled with anguish, when one's life becomes hopeless, helpless and meaningless, how can we suppose that someone is willing to prolong his suffering life like this? People have their rights to choose life or death, if death is unavoidable, why can't we let these patients choose a death of peace instead a death of pain and misery?  	Euthanasia is a relief to the patient's family. When a patient suffers an incurable disease, his family suffer together with him. They have to take care of him, pay for the treatment. The distress and anxiety interrupt their normal lives and works. The patient becomes a great burden which can't be released until the unavoidable death comes. They may think about [fm3, -1] Euthanasia, but due to the moral system, few families dare to help the patient commit euthanasia, even the patient beggs [fm1,-] for it. An ordinary Chinese family normally can not afford such a great amount of treatment fee, they have to borrow it from others, or work harder to earn more, which causes them painful mentally and physically. After the death of the patient, their pain does not stop, for they have to manage to pay the money back. In fact, whatever family do, the result will be the same. Even patients themselves won't like their families suffer in this way. So why not put a [np7, 1-] earlier end to both sides' pain?  	China is a poor country which provide free medical service, though now patient's family is required to afford part of the fee, the rest of it is still a heavy burden to the country. We put the money in prolonging dying person's life without consideration that there are a lot of other more meaningful aspects which need money urgently. Statistics indicate that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year. If we put these money into education, into medical research, doesn't it comform [fm1,-] to more people' benefits?  	Many people object euthanasia because they worry about the abuse of it, then any form of murder might be conveniently dubbed "mercy killing" by unscrupulous persons. However, by strick [fm1,-1] requirment or regulation such as the request of the induced death in writing and joint approval of all medical personnel attending the case, etc. The problem of abuse will be in control and eventually [fm1, -1] sovled.  	As more education on death is advocated, euthanasia will become a trend. In order to end the patients's [fm1,-] misery and to release the heavy burden of the hospital, the family and the country, euthanasia should be legalized in China.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ?o???  		Euthanasia  	Euthanasia, which means to help hastening the deaths of some incurable patients by medicine on the basis of good will and mercy, has been a popular topic and concern nowadays. With the development of medical science, human beings can prolong individual's life or hasten "the brutal end" through modern techniques. But "mercy killing" arouses enthusiastic discussions in the ethical and legal fields.  	Some people who are for euthanasia argue that helping to hasten the deaths of terminally ill patients is humane. For first, human beings have the right to die; second, when the life process requires assistance, extending an incurable life means aggravating sufferings, the patient also needs dignity and peace; third, a hopeless patient is a heavy burden to the hospital and his family.  	While I don't think euthanasia is suitable for any case. In China, a traditional country dominated by the Taoism and Buddhism, the adoption of the practice of Euthanasia [fm3, 1-] requires changes in ethics and more careful considerations and performance.  	First, influenced by Buddhism and Taoism for 3000 years, Chinese people have their own ethical codes which differ from the Americans'. Taoism and Buddhism emphasize the harmony between man and nature, under this circumstance man should conquer nature and take advantage of it. The attitude towards life is positive: Man should never give up facing difficulties. The concept of "respecting the serious and cherishing the young" has deep root in people's mind, so to approve the practice of euthanasia is hard for both parties: the patient, especially for his family. Because for the patient, to escape from the dilemma doesn't necessarily mean dignity and peace, it means cowardice and retreat. In addition, human beings instrically [fm1,-] have an impluse [fm1,-] to live. For the family, they will be criticized as "selfish and inhumane". In addition, euthanasia will bring about great emotional pains to them.  	Second, the popularization of euthanasia would invite abuse and sometimes be used by unscupulous [fm1,-] persons to achieve some evil goals. So you should guarantee that the practice is carried out on the basis of good will and mercy. Some disobedient, selfish and greedy children will be eager to hasten their parents' death so as to relieve the heavy burden and share their possessions. So it requests careful investigation before the act is committed. But in China, the legal system isn't very effective, so it's hard to carry out this evaluation activity. All this disadvantages will actually lead to some murders.  	Lastly, as we know, science develops at a rapid speed. President Clinton declared that man will cure AIDS in ten years. While some scientists said, cancer won't be incurable 5 years later. Some day, Human [fm3, 1-] beings can cure any disease, so to live is to hope. Though it may be painful but it's hopeful as well. Why not have a try?  	All in all, euthanasia can be carried out, but should be carefully considered and performed in China. It needs changes in ethics.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> 3???(c)  	 Legalization of Euthanasia  	Euthanasia from the Greek means a good death. The argument about the legalization of mercy killing has experienced for a long time in the western countries. Nowadays, this problem extends and lands on China. In my opinions [np5, 1-] euthanasia should be lowful [fm1,-] in China, because it is feasible and its advantages are overwhelming to its disadvantages no matter in terms of the state and hospital, patient's family or individual.  	In the first place, China's population is approaching to 1.3 billion. The problem of overpopulation has caused the shortage of medical fund per person. As a result, 200 patients share one doctor in China while less than 80 patients share one doctor in the United States. At the same time, statistics indicate that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year, thus the medical cost is a heavy burden for the state and hosptals [fm1,-] Let us suppose that we donate this amount of money to the Project Hope, lots of students will benefit. Meanwhile, a hopelessly dying patient needs a lot of expensive and rare medecine [fm1,-] and facilities to maintain his life. Under the circumstances, it is unavoidable that the conflict between the hopeless patient and the hopeful counterpart appears, owing to he [fm1,-] fact that which person should use the only medecine [fm1,-] first. Therefore sometimes, lasting a dying person means to deprive a living one of life. Legalizing mercy killing is helpful to solve this problem.  	For the family members, it is a kind of torture to see their dear relatives dying for a long time with anguish. It is hard to imagine the fact that people watch their relatives to struggle against the pain and they cannot help them. It is harsh to know the truth that your relatives must pass away in several weeks or days. Euthanasia can be a great relief to them both mentally and physically. On the other hand, views on death are changing in China, where a traditional saying is that debt is better than death. New belief is that people should die in peace and harmony. Therefore, most people consider they prefer their relatives to die happily instead of painfully living.  	In the third place, above all, euthanasia is a kind of mukti [fm1,-] for the patient himself. A [np7, 1-] outsider usually can not feel that the patient grieves to the extent of wishing to die. A survey of 200 old people shows that 92 percent do not fear death. They do not want a long waiting period. They want to die with dignity and peace, instead of agony and degradation. Obviously, euthanasia is a progressive way to die because mercy killing can hasten the death of hopelessly ill individuals by withholding life-sustaining procedures so that the death will occur naturally and quickly. Dying in several minutes is much better than dying in a week with agony. Meanwhile, people have right to decide in which way they die. People don't have choice to be born, but they have authority to determinate their future. When the doctor "sentences" a patient to death and he losses his living will, waiting death is an unhuman [fm1,-] thing. Forcing others to wait for death is the cruelest and most impersonal crime. People should respect others' death choice.  	In conclusion, euthanasia should be legalized in China, for it is feasible and reasonable.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> 1y?t?  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia or mercy killing means terminating the life of a person who is dying and suffering from uncurable [fm1,-] illness and no way can recover his health and relieve his pain when assisting death is expected. Although in the past decades various human ideas are undergoing changes, it still difficult for them to face death easily. Death is, in most cases, viewed as a failure of the life, which is painful and terrible. This is the main reason why euthanasia causes so much controversy in the world. Many people still consider it inhumane to perform euthanasia for a person, no matter how painlessly, for it seems to be against the natural course toward death, which should not be [vp7, s] interfere with. In general, it contradicts with people's traditional morals. Nowadays there are only a few countries which have officially legalized euthanasia and much more are in the course of the legalization.  	In China euthanasia is no longer a new topic and it is "quietly being practised in some areas despite a lack of legal protection for the death option." Under Chinese particular circumstances, euthanasia should be formalized and legalized so as to follow the trend.  	First of all, euthanasia is a [wd5, 1-] humane means to terminate a dying person's life so as to relieve his extreme pains. It accords with Chinese traditional morals--to be kind and merciful to others in unhappiness. As we know the patient's health is impossible to be recovered and extreme pains are unable to be relieved. Can we just calmly see them suffering without doing anything? In this case, death is probably the only and the best way for him. Let him die calmly and painlessly assisted by the doctor. It is not against traditional morals but a development of it.  	Secondly, every person has the legal right to die and as one basic human right it must never be deprived. Undoubtedly, every person has the right of survival, which is man's basic instinct and desire, but one should also have the right to die to complete his existence in the world, with the rapid economic growth in China, the improvement of the legal system should keep up with it. Euthanasia should be recognized and legalized to improve the legal system to protect the people's right to die.  	Thirdly, euthanasia is the right way to relieve the pain and the burden added to the concerned family and the whole society. In most cases, the treatment of stubborn disease is rather expensive. It costs both the family and the society a large amount of money, but the money can not help the cure of the diseases and only prolongs the patient's extreme pains and the burdens to the family and society. It is to a great extent, meaningless and useless. China is a developing country with huge population and badly needs funds and energy to keep a rapid economic growth to keep up with other countries. So euthanasia is a moral way to avoid the waste of money and save more money to accelerate the economic growth [sn9, s] the improvement of the living people's living conditions.  	Finally, the Chinese public begin to accept the view of euthanasia and [sn8,s] increasing number of people think it is moral to perform it and it should be legalized as soon as possible. People are able to confront the idea of death much more calmly and sensibly than before.  	It can be estimated that euthanasia will eventually be accepted by all the people in the world, for it is an inevitable trend which can not be stopped. In this case, China should legalize it [fm1, -1] initiatively instead of following other countries' heels because of its particular characteristics and people's favorable views.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ?a"2  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	Euthanasia, a word form the Greek, means "a good death", which has another name of "mercy killing" in English. Although it's a medical terminology, euthanasia has arisen [vp1, 1-] a world-wide discussion whether it is legal or not. Some states of the U.S, some countries in Europe and some other places in the world have made laws that permit euthanasia. However, there has [vp3, 1-4] been no laws in China on this issue, which has caused troubles for courts. I will argue that euthanasia should be legalized in China in my essay on the basis of human rights, legal system and its goodness to all, including the patient, his/her family and this country.  	It's a respect to the patient's human right to allow him to die in the legal way of euthanasia in a suitable time. Suppose that now [ad1, 1-] I were a very old man lying on the bed in a hospital. I have [vp8, 1-] had a lung cancer for decades and suffered too much. My life would end in an indefinite [sn8,s] period and no doctor but God can help me release my pain. At this time, I have [vp8, 1-] only one hope in my mind that I'd better die painlessly at once. But because I'm in China, there is no law to allow me to do so or to allow the doctor to end my suffering so that I would continue the process of waiting for death. The cases of euthanasia happened [sn8,s] in the U.S shows [vp3, s-] that the mercy killing under the requirement of the patients and it's a respect to their individual rights. "Helping to hasten the death of terminally ill patients is humane, [sn9, s] said Cai Wenmei, an associate professor at the Institute of Population at Beijing University." Every one in our country has the right to choose his/her life style and the laws are established to protect our rights. Thus, if we couldn't suffer the pain any longer and have no hope to turn around, we should have the right to end our life in the way of "mercy killing."  	The key point [wd4, s] the discussion on euthanasia is whether it's legal or not. Some people said it's a murder to kill those who cannot move, but I'll argue that it's legal. Murder means the crime of killing a person intentionally. The crime of murder in law consists of three parts: the criminals motivation, the criminal's behaviour and the harm of this crime. The doctor, or the killer of the patient who requires to end his own life in a painless way has no motivation to kill a person who will die soon because he has no hatred towards the patient and even several days before he had made all his efforts to save the patient's life. So do the patient's family members who agree to take this action. The doctor, or the killer, really take [vp3,5-] a killing action, but it's not illegal because he has no motivation and the result of his killing is not harmful, which I will illustrate later. The doctor, or the killer help [vp3, 1-] the patient end his painful life under his requirement. Should this killing be called harmful to the patient? The answer to this question is obvious "No". The three contexts of the murder [sn8,s] of euthanasia cannot stand on their feet, so euthanasia is legal and the law of euthanasia should be established to permit those patients who suffer too much and have ho hope to live a happy life to end their life painlessly.  	Then we should discuss what goodness euthanasia will bring to us. First [sn6, s] it's good for the patient. "a [fm3, 1-] survey of 200 old people shows that 92 percent do not fear death. They don't want a long waiting period. They want to die with dignity and peace, instead of agony and degradation." Secondly [sn9, s] euthanasia, "the progressive way to die", can reduce the cost of the patient's family an [fm1,-] release their pain. Cai Wenmei said that euthanasia is " a great relief to their family members, both mentally and physically". Thirdly, it also can reduce the cost of our country. China practices the free medical service so that it spends a large sum of money to save those who cannot be saved every year. If we practice euthanasia according to the patient's will, we can spend the money to save those who can be saved and to [sn8,s] cure those who have no money.  	It's time for China to establish a law to permit euthanasia. Of course, we will confront with the bias from all sides of the society in this process, but if we make clear the goodness of euthanasia to the whole country, we can make progess [fm1,-] on this point. I hope that I can die in the way of euthanasia when I become very old and suffer too much from some illness. I believe that my hope will become true and soon or later euthanasia will be legalized in China.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2> ???1/2o  		Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China  	It is a complicated and ever-changing era. Human beings have continually accomplished miracles during the process of civilization; yet, they are confronting increasing unprecedented problems as well: Neuclear [fm1,-] power, clone, and other issues concerning man's existence, just to name a few.  	And now, there crops up "euthanasia", a topic that once again catches global attention.  	Euthanasia, generally speaking, refers to the bringing about of a mercifully easy and painless death for persons suffering from an incurable and painful disease.  	Although, medically, it has been considered a humane way to hasten the death of terminally ill patients, it is still unacceptable in ethics for quite a large number of people.  	Nevertheless, many countries, like Uruguay, have legalized mercy killing. Switzerland, Norway, and Germany have adopted similiar [fm1,-] approaches. And the U.S. [sn9, s] after several such cases, is also calling for law revision.  	While in China, where the national conditions are more complex, the problem calls for prudent solution. It is well known that this is a comparatively conservative and traditional nation. Thus, the question of euthanasia expectedly raises serious moral issues. The Chinese have long emphasized the harmony between man and nature, and obeyed the natural law. In addition, their minds are deep-rooted with the concept of fifial [fm1,-] piety. Therefore, regardless of the patient's suffering, they are strongly against mercy killing.  	However, as far as the positive effects of euthanasia and China's current [fm1, -1] fundemental circumstances are concerned, Euthanasia [fm3, 1-] should be legalized in the country.  	To begin with, euthanasia is humane both for the patients and for their relatives. When the prolongation of life only give people pain and sorrow instead of joy and happiness, it has lost its original wish. After all, death is not a failure, but a normal and natural stage of life. How to choose life style is one's right. When people can never regain consciousness, it becomes [fm1, -1] uncessary and meaningless to artificially maintain life.  	A survey of 200 old people shows that 92% do not fear death. They want to die with dignity and peace, instead of agony and degradation. Euthanasia is a progressive way to die, said a report in Beijing Daily.  	Compared with indefinite brutal waiting period of death by aid of medical technology, mercy killing can hasten the death of hopelessly ill individuals by withholding life-sustaining procedures so that death will occur naturally and quickly. Then, undoubtedly, is a great relief either for the suffering patients or for their family members, both mentally and [fm1, -1] phisically. [sn8,s] 	Next, China's current situation is another factor. Although the country has achieved greatly in many fields, it is still a developing country, with comparatively backward economic level, medical care, social security and lack of finance as well as overpopulation. As a result, it may be a great burden to afford the considerable costs and care of the incurable ones.  	All in all, no matter [sn8,s] for the individuals or the whole country, it helps to legally practise euthanasia. Actually, it is quietly being practised in some urgent [wd3, 1-] areas of China despite a lack of legal protection for the death option.  	But, since it implies that active measures will be taken to terminate human life, which is an exceedingly dangerous principle to allow, it needs promising [wd7, 1-] protection, namely, laws and regulations.  	Although time is not yet ripe for the large majority to accept the concept emotionally, legal system dealing with euthanasia should be established, comprehensively and urgently. It is a serious matter, and only serious laws can provide secure solution.

Considering the current situation, [sn3,s] should enthanasia [fm1,-] be legalized in China as Uruguay, Switzerland and other countries have adopted the approaches? [sn7,s] Some people argue that Chinese people have been longing for longevity in [wd5, 1-1] China ever since the ancient times [wd3, 1-] so nobody has the right to provide such a shortcut for a patient's death thus depriving his or her right of leading a longer life. As a traditional saying goes, debt is better than death. Doctors and nurses should try their best to prolong their patients [np4, 1-2] lives instead if [fm1,-] giving their [pr4, 1-] lethal injection of air so as to send them to God earlier.   Certainly, the terminally ill patients will appreciate these people's concern about their lives. Yet, is it a good thing to extend human suffering, to prolong life, not in order to give joy and happiness, but to give pain and sorrow? No doubt people will prefer a long happy life if they are healthy and don't have to become their family's burden. [sn8,s] But what's the point of remaining alive if they know it's impossible for them to recover and death will after all come upon them no mattre [fm1,-] how hard they try? Therefore, if euthanasia is legalized in China, this kind of sufferers will have the right and be able to choose to be alive or dead. A survey of 200 old people shows that 92 per cent do not fear death. Why can't we just let them die with dignity and peace, instead of agony and degradation [sn9, s] under the protection of law if they choose to?   Nowadays, it's extremely expensive to provide medical treatment to any kind of patients. Most of us may have the experience of paying more than a hundred yuan for only a few tablets for a cold, still less [wd7, 1-] the cost of complicated treatment for those incurable diseases. Statistics indicate that medical treatment for comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year, which is a heavy burden for the patient's family. Would the patient like to see his or her family in debt while he or she is waiting for the inevitable coming of death. Family value is always of great importance to Chinese people. Of course his or her family members would be happy enough if he or she could live longer and stay with them, because they love each other. However, could it be better if both the patient and the family members can decide and come up with a better solution legally for the good of both sides in place of doing it quietly and both of the two sides feel guilty afterwards? [sn8,s] It's a secred [fm1,-] duty for doctors and nurses to help a patient and prolong their lives if possible. China's famous for its traditional Chinese medicine, but it can hardly guarantee any doctor, or even the the [wd6, 1-] most experienced and reputed doctor, can cure all the diseases. [sn8,s] If [np6, -2] doctor's job is to help a patient to get out of pain. [sn2, s] It'll be very nice if him [pr4, 1-2] or her to artificially [wd7, 1-] maintain a patient's life as possible as they can. [sn8,s] But is it necessary to do that if it's beyond the point when people can never recover or regain consciousnesss [fm1,-] ? Certainly not. By so doing, they are in fact helping the patient to sustain his or her agony, both mentally [wd2, 1-2] and physically, instead of his or her life. If the doctor is welll [fm1,-] aware that they will be sentenced to prison and fined after they hasten the death of hopelessly ill individuals by mercy killing. [sn9, s] Will [fm3, 1-] he or she still be willing to assist the patients to get rid of their pain even if they request? It's more likely that Chinese doctors will prefer to obey the law rather than break it.   Though time is not yet ripe for drawing up laws for euthanasia according to the report in Beijing Daily, we should take action to enhance this act. Euthanasia should be legalized in China for the sake of the patient, his or her family an doctors.   

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> ??  Euthanasia Should Be Legalized In China   Euthanasia, a word coming from the Greek which means "a good death", has aroused great attention around the world. Euthanasia, or mercy killing, possesses the meaning of "the painless killing of people who are incurably ill or very old". It is usually taken by the doctor or the relatives of the patient, who do not want to see any more torture and sufferings and [sn6, s] it is undr [fm1,-] the patient's permission.   In China nowadays, euthanasia has been pratised in some areas and more and more people want to induce mercy killing. So that [wd5, 1-] it should be legalized and standardized as soon as possible to protect the patient's rights and prevent any illegal abuses.   Euthanasia, at the first sight, might be regarded as the action to deprive the patient of the right of survival. But actually, it assures the right of the patient to decide his or her life, to live on for a period of time with great pains and enormous medical fee or to die peacefully. In fact, those patients who demand mercy killing are those whose diseases can not be cured and they will sooner or later die of them. [sn7,s] Some [wd5, 1-] others are those who have no opprotunity [fm1,-] to regain their consciousness and thus the mercy killing would be asked for by his or her families. Exactly like [wd3, 1-] Cai Wenmei, an associate professor at the Institute of Population at Beijing University, stated, death should not be viewed as a failure, but as a normal and natural stage of life and people have the right to die.   Many the relatives of the patient who end their life because they love him or her deeply. [sn8,s] For example, the young man named Lestr [fm1,-] M. Zygnamiak in the United States, shot his idolized elder brother dead under his allowance. Lester worshipped his brother very much but he could not see him suffer after he knew that his brother would be paralyzed for life and [vp9, -1] would nevre [fm1,-] walk again. Similaily,[fm1,-] there is Mrs. Ross, who kill [vp6,s-] her baby daughter [sn9, s] for she was born seriously handicapped. Both of them were not sentenced to any penalties.   And situation in China is quite optimistic for [fm1, -1] enthanasia. In a survey of 200 old persons, 92 percent shown [vp6,s-] that they did not fear death. In respect of the cost for the medical treatment, euthanasia will reduce graetly [fm1,-] the burden for both the hospitals and the relatives. Most importantly, the view on death of Chinese is changing, [sn8,s] death is no longer considered as the worst thing. [sn1,s] The respected Deng Yingchao, [sn9, s] said she was gratly [fm1,-] in favour of mercy killing as a practical concept.   Although the legalization of euthanasia is [wd3, 1-] a long way to go, the will of those people who want to end their life painlessly should be protected by law. Meanwhile, legal system should also be induced to prevent any abuse of euthanasia.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> ?1/4??  Euthanasia Sould [fm1,-] Be Legalized In China   Euthanasia, or mercy killing, which is still quite a new term for many [cc4, 1-1] Chinese, means to end a terminally ill patient's life after [pp1, 1-1] deliberation. China is a traditional and conservative society, the strict moral values often prevent people from understanding and accepting this method. But a lot of facts and experiences have proved that the proper use of this method is benefitial [fm1,-] to patients themselves, their families and even the society. In order to make sure this method is used right and justifiably, it should be legalized in China.   From the moral point of view, Euthanasia is humane because it helps to ease [wd3, 1-] the pain and sorrow of those incurably ill patients. For those paralyzed and badly deformed people, life is almost meaningless, with no happiness and joy. They have to face agony mentally and physically every moment. Although they are living, they are being tortured in hell. To extend such a life is more cruel and inhamane [fm1,-] than to end it. And above all, they have no chance to change this situation. It will be a nightmare to live the rest of their life like that. Moreover, the patient's family and friends will have to face many [np8, 1-] pressure and shoulder graet [fm1,-] burden by seeing their beloved ones suffering and struggling helplessly all the time. In this hopeless situation, death is the only progressive way to go, where patients can find the peace and relief. [sn7,s] It is absolutely moral to use such [wd5, 1-] euthanaisa [fm1,-] with the patients and the family's approval undr [fm1,-] such despair [wd2, 1-] circumstances.   From the legal point of view, the legalization of euthanasia can protect the rights of patients and their doctors. Death is a normal and natural stage of life, people have their right to die when life become a process of suffering. We can't determine our birth, but we are in charge of our death. Hospitals and families should respect the dying person's rights and will to choose their way of life, including death. Death, which is like birth, sometimes requires assistance. So doctors have to take up this responsibility, which often causes a lot of controversies and disputes. The doctors who help patients to end their lives have the danger o [fm1,-] facing murder charges. As a result, many doctors are reluctant to use euthanasia. In order to aviod [fm1,-] misunderstanding and unnecessary conflicts, a series of rules and regulations should be established so that euthanasia can be carried out in a more harmonious and smooth way.   To aviod [fm1,-] the negative effects of euthanasia, the legalization of it is more [aj3, 1-] necessary. Some people argued that "mercy killing" would invite a new form of murder conducted by unscrupulous persons. So if we establish a legal system with an evaluation body to judge the case before the act is committed, it will be much safer. Strict laws concerning euthanasia should be worked out: it should be performed only at the patient's request, with the consent of his relatives and the signature of a lawyer. So if we legalize euthanasia in China, a lot of trouble and abuse can be avioded [fm1,-]   Many countries have legalized euthanasia and proved it to be workabl [fm1,-] It is just a matter of time for China to do so. But Chinese people's deep-rooted [wd3, -1] ethnics make [vp3, 1-] the general adoption of euthanasia a rough way, which still requires a lot of efforts. But no matter how difficult it is, the truth will finally be accepted.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> ???"a  Euthanasia Should Be Legalized In China   In recent years, a new concept 'euthanasia' or 'mercy killing' has sneaked into our life and been accepted by a considrable [fm1,-] number of people. Countries like Uruguay, Switzerland, Norway, and Germany have already adopted it as legal. It's time that the pratice [fm1,-] of euthanasia be legalized in China, too.   Why? Because it's the will of most Chinese people!   With the progress of civilization, the Chinese people's concept of life is changing, by which I mean that we have shifted our focus on mere longevity to the pursuit of the quality of life, making euthanasia more acceptable and feasible. To illustrate this, let's have an example. Suppose in the hospital, there are two patients of cancer, both of whom are in their sixties. A, knowing that there is scarcely any hope of recovering, chooses 'mercy killing' to end his life actively; while B contimues [fm1,-] to struggle against death, suffers all the impossible pains and tortues [fm1,-] and finally closes his eyes. Without any doubt, in the past, when longevity was respected so much and when 'euthanasia' was not yet born, B's way of dying was the more preferable choice and probably the only choice, too.   But things are different now. The above example when discussed in my class, 100% of my fellow students prefer A's way of death, or rather, his perception of life. After all, when there is no longer hopes, or happiness left for us, what's the point of sustaining it [wd7, -1] artificially? To live, is to be useful-either to your beloved ones or to the society. It is meaningless to lie in bed to wait for death.   It will be arbitary [fm1,-] to draw a conclusion [wd5, -1] thus taht [fm1,-] all the Chinese are able to face up to death easily already. We should also take into consideration the parties involved-the patient himself and his family. After all, if euthanasia is to be legalized, it should be, first of all, in accord with the patients' and their families' will. Then, what will they think?   In China, people have always been taught to sacrifice one's benefits for others, especially their children. Influenced by this doctrine, the Chinese people, especially the old, always tend to put the [wd6, 1-] the benefits of theri [fm1,-] offsprings in the first place. Actually, many people when suffering from incurable diseases,[sn9,s] would prefer to die lest they become a burden to the young or the rest of the family. It is indeed a dual suffering to survive artificially- on the one hand, the patient is suffering from the disease; on the other hand, seeing his family worrying, grieving and being busy for him is another and even greater pain. To die actively, thus, is a release.   Similarly, it's true with the family members. We 'kill', because we love them. It's more [aj3, 1-1] cruel to see our relatives strugging [fm1,-] helplessly against death than to put an end to their lives a little earlier.   In conclusion, owing to the changing concept of life, the Chinese view the coming of death now with a more [wd7, -1] accepting attitude. As a result, the pratice [fm1,-] of euthanasia, which is a release both to the patient and the family members or the society in a broader sense, is in accord with the will and benefits of most Chinese. Since laws are to protect the people and speak for the people, it's time that euthanasia [vp8, -1] be legalized in China on condition that the disease is incurable and the patient agrees.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> "??t1/4?  Euthanasia Should Be Legalized In China   Euthanasia means a good death. If a patient who has got incurable disease and suffered unbearable pain asks his doctor or relative to put end to his life, he is asking for an euthanasia.   Long long ago euthanasia was considered as inhumane by almost the whole human society because people considered it as evil to end one's life-a natural process granted by God. But nowadays a lot of cases about euthanasia show that more and more people have begun to accept euthanasia, notably in a highly developed country like the U.S. Take Anna Ross, a twenty-five American woman's case as an example. After she conducted an euthanasia on her newly born baby daughter, who had been deformed and expected to spend much of her life in hospitals, a survey of more than 10,000 majority of 98% agreed with her action and Ross was found not guilty by jury in under three hours. [sn8,s] Similarly, an increasing number of people in China have begun to regard euthanasia as a good thing, which should be legalized.   In fact, euthanasia has a lot of advantages, which make good reasons for its legalization in China.   First, euthanasia can relax the unendurable pain of the seriously ill patients. For those who have suffered severe diseases like cancers or lapsed into prolonging unconciousness [fm1,-1] nad have very little hope of recovery, the entending [fm1,-] of their lives is in fact the same as aggravating their pain and an euthanasia is the best treatment for their diseases.   Secondly, euthanasia is also a great relief to both the patients' family members and the hospital. In China the cost of the treatment for some diseases like cancers are very [ad2, 1-] enormous. Statistics indicate that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year, a heavy burden for the hospital and the patient's family. Some families have to lead a poor life because they owe a large sum of money spent on the treatment of their relatives' incurable diseases, which will not happen if euthanasia is legalized in China.   Thirdly, euthanasia has a wide social foundation in China. That is to say, more and more Chinese people, young and old, men and women, have begun to welcome euthanasia. A survey of 200 old Chines [fm1,-] people shows that 92% do not fear death. They want to die in dignity and peace, which can be brought by euthanasia, instead of agony and degradation.   Forthly [fm1,-] if we do not legalized [fm1,-] euthanasia, murders in the name of euthanasia will occur more frequently. Euthanasia is now quietly being practised in some urban areas of China despite [pp2, 1-1] of a lack [wd4, s] legal protection of death option. So, if we draw up corresponding laws to guide and supervise euthanasia, illegal operations will be reduced to the minimum. Since euthanasia is really happening in China and is has been accepted by more and more people, why don't we legalize it to regulate it? [sn8,s] Obviously, there is still a long way to go for euthanasia to be legalized. But I believe that with the changing of people's concept on death and attitude towards life, euthanasia will be widely accepted by Chinese and legalized sooner or later.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> D"?  Euthanasia Should Be Legalized In China   While more cases of euthanasia have been induced in some urban areas of China, [sn8,s] euthanasia invites increasing concern from the Chinese people and arguments on whether it should be legalized or not [vp3, -1] arises. Some people are against euthanasia, considering it as an inhumane murder, worrying about the abuse of euthanasia and weakened efforts in research on medical science. Some people [vp3, -1] argues thaht [fm1,-] euthanasia or mercy killing is humane and should be legalized in China. I support the latter.   Mercy killing is a humane behaviour because it shows respect to the rights of death of a dying patient suffering extreme anguish. Every person has the rights to live as well as to choose the style of death. Although Chinese people are yearn for longevity, [sn8,s] they also wish for peaceful death. When we try every effort and use medication and life support system to save dying patients who suffer uncurable [fm1,-] disease and there is no hope for the avoidance of death, we emotionally think ourselves as humane but actually we have inhumanly deprived them of their rights for peaceful death and prolong the severe painful torture on them. To artificially prolong a patient's life when there is no hope for recovery is not for the sake of the patient but for the sake of our emotional satisfacton [fm1,-]   Euthanasia is humane also for the families of the patient. It is a relief for their mental and physical burden. It is a heavy physical burden for the family to take care of the dying patient but their efforts are for somethign [fm1,-] hopeless. It is also a mental tortue [fm1,-] for them when they see their beloved suffering anguishful [fm2, 1-] pain but they can do little to ease the pain. It is quite common around us that after a patient [vp6, -1] died, his or her several family members also fall ill. [sn8,s] I can see how [wd7, -1] humane it is to artificially prolong the life against the hopelessness when so many people suffer at the same time.   The worry about the abuse of euthanasia is unnecessary because it si [fm1,-3] possible and avaible [fm1,-] to work out laws on euthanasia to protect the practice. We can make detailed regulations to ensure that euthanasia should [vp9, 1-] be performed at the patient [np4,1-1] request with the consent of his or her relatives and the signature of a lawyer.     It is too [ad1, 1-] over cautious to worry that legalized euthanasia will make doctors too easy to give up efforts to save a patient and scietists [fm1,-] not to try hard on research on treatment for fatal diseases. [sn8,s] Euthanasia is not allowed to be performed unless it si [fm1,-2] proved thaht little can be done to improve the patient's condition. Doctors will still try every possible [fm1, -1] traetment. It is not true that when there is no avaible [fm1,-] treatment, artificially prolonging the life of a dying person will lead to the approach in the treatment of a certain disease. Scietists [fm1,-] have no reason to lessen their efforts on research because humaning [fm2, 1-] being is not used for experients [fm1,-3] and euthanasia has nothing to do with their effort to find out a cure.   In conclusion, euthanasia should be legalizde [fm1,-] in China because it is humane and can be protected by laws.

With the increasing perfection of Chinese law system, it si [fm1,-] necessary and urgent to draw up laws for euthanasia. And we must also change our concept about death.   Death is as a noraml [fm1,-] and natural stage of life as birth. Citizen are endowed with the rights of birth and death. WE [fm3, 1-] have the right to die as well as the choice [wd3, s] how to die, especially when striken [fm1,-] with severe sufferings of a terminal illness. Laws respect people's legal rights and shouldn't negnect [fm1,-] people's request for death as a release from tortuous [wd3, 1-] pain and meaningless existence. We all want to die with dignity and peace instead of agony and degradation. Euthanasisa [fm1,-] is a progressive and peaceful way to die. So why shouldn't euthanasia be legalized in China?   Some people in China oppose mercy killing, saying that it si [fm1,-] murder [sn6, s] and inhumane. They quote a traditional Chinese saying that debt is better death. [sn8,s] We are alive now and haven't experienced the extreme pain from a terminal illness. Suppose we are suffering torturous pain of a cancer and often scream out in anguish from our bed. There's no chance for recovery. Is it merciful and kind to let us continue screaming, shouting and twisting sharply [ad1, 1-] our body because of pain, etc.? At ther [fm1,-] same time our family members are burdened both [fm1, -1] emntally and physically, who have to pay large sum of money for our medication and life support systems just to maitain [fm1,-4] our existence? I thnk most of us will choose a peaceful way to die so as to bring a graet [fm1,-] relief to our family members as well as to save the money fro [fm1,-] a better use. It is humane that helps to hasten the death of terminally ill patients and shows true kindness and understanding of death as a release from agony and suffering. [sn8,s] Laws on euthanasia should be worked out to protect the practice. According to Cai Wemei, an associate professor at Beijing University and an expert in demography, mercy killing, generally induced by an injection of sedatives, should be performed only at the patient's request, with the consent of his relatives and the signiture [fm1,-] of a lawyer. A thorough examination must be introduced on his physical condition and the effect of further medical treatment before the decision of euthanasia is made. Meanwhile we must take precautious [fm1,-] against murder under the pretext of mercy killing.   Above all, the legalization of euthanasia require changes in ethics [sn9, s] especially our attitudes towards death. Birth and death are both natural eveents [fm1,-] but the emotional impact and meanings of these two are vastly different for us Chinese. Birth is usually anticipated with excitement and joy. Since we can accept birth, why can't we accept death with peace and dignity?   Education on death for Chinese is needed. And we hope the legalization of euthanasia will quicken its step with the increasing perfection of Chinese law system and [wd4, s] every one will change his or her concept about death [sn9, s] which is also a symbol of modernization of China.   

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> ??  Euthanasia Shouldn't Be Legalized In China   Euthanasia is still a very contravercial [fm1,-] issue in the world. Some countries accept it and legalize it, [wd4, s] Uruguay. In other countries, euthanasia either exists but not legalized like in America, or is strongly against. [sn8,s] I don't think euthanasia should be legalized in China.   Euthanasia is also called mercy killing. It refers to hastening the death of terminally ill patient, usually under the patient's request and [vp6, -1] done through legal [wd7, 1-1] injection. It comes into existence because it puts an end to the graet [fm1,-] suffering of the patient who sees no hope and to the burden of his family. Euthanasia is a good release in some cases, but to legalize euthanasia in China is another thing. It shouldn't be legalized in China.   Life is very precious and also full of struggle, we can't easily give up hope. But man is often weak in mind when he is seriously ill. Legalizing euthansuia [fm1,-] implies that man can take active measure to end his life and this may easily encourage patient's negative thoughts. When suffering from graet [fm1,-] pain [sn9, s] a lot of patients think they have incurable disease in fact it is not the case, [sn8,s] instead many patients become seriously ill because of their worry. In this case, if euthanasia is legalized, a lot of patients will be induced to appeal to it. In fact confidence and optimism [vp6, -1] approved to be an important factor in the treatment of diseases. And some treatment does be hard or expensive, like chemical treatment. [sn8,s] So we should encourage patients rather than induce them to give up hope.   In countries where euthanasia is legalized, mercy killing is legal when the patient is terminally ill. But in fact it is very hard to determine whether a patient is ill or not. One factor is that in ost [fm1,-] areas in China, especially the countryside, the medical equipments [np5, 1-] are still backward. It is not conscentious [fm1,-] to decide a patient can't be cured under conditions or skills [pp1, 1-] insufficient. Another factor is that mercy [wd7, 1-] patients who are sentenced to death in hospital survive after their struggle. For example, Qiging has saved many cancer patients who had been dimmed [wd3, 1-] no hope. There are also patients who lose senses, [sn9, s] mind and become unconscious like a log miraculously recovered. [sn8,s] For example, the famous Family magazine once tells a true story of a woman who takes graet [fm1,-] care of her husband, who become unconcious [fm1,-] after a serious car accident. The hospital can't cure his husband, while she doesn't give up hope. She learns from a doctor traditional Chinese medicine and keeps masaging [fm1,-] her husband for several years, talks and [vp3, s-] sing to him everyday to wake him. And her confidence and persistence is finally rewarded.   Euthanasia can be defined legal only when requested by the patient, agreed by family members and approved by doctors. This also makes legalizing euthansia [fm1,-] not reasonable in China. China is [np6, -1] developing country, a member of her citizens are still not rich. [sn8,s] The traetment [fm1,-] of a badly ill patient is a heavy burden to his family, especially in rural area. Under this [np9,-] circumstances, people who is [vp3,2-] not caring, moral will manipulate the law of euthanasia. He may force, of course not in obvious way, the patient to say that he [vp3, -1] want to end the suffering of disease, or delay the treatment until the patient is really incurable. If the patient is unconsious [fm1,-] that [wd5, 1-] it will be much easier. In fact newspapers have given similar reports. On the contrary, there are also some patients who are very considerate about his family and [vp3, -1] doesn't want to be hard for them, therefore [vp3, -1] asks for euthanasia even [cj2, 1-] he [pr3, 1-1] is not willing to die. And this can't be a release of burden in real sense, no matter [cj2, 1-] for the patient or for his family.   Chinese law is established to protest [wd3, 1-] citizens' right, and the legalization of euthanasia can not really be an exception. But according to the above mentioned factors, legalizing euthanasia can not really garantee [fm1,-] the people's right. Therefore euthanasia shouldn't be legalized in China.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> 3??1/4  Euthanasia Should Be Legalized In China   Euthanasia, or mercy killing, is the painless killing of incurably ill or old people. The practice of euthanasia recieved [fm1,-] controversial opinions all over the world. Countries like Uruguay, Switzerland, Norway and Germany protect mercy killing in their laws, whereas in other countries, the issue still [vp3, -1] stand [wd2, -1] debate. What is the case in China, then? Time may not ripe for drawing up laws for euthanasia according to the report in Beijing Daily. [sn8,s] But from a long term point of view, euthanasia should be legalized in China.   First of all. [sn2,s] We'd better distinguish mercy killing from murder. Murder is conducted to the interest of the killer against the will of the victim. While mercy killing is done to end the pain of those sufferers so that they can be relieved from constant anguishes of life. It is often agreed upon by the [fm1, -1] recievers. This can be seen in [wd4, s] following cases. In America, the famous doctor Sanders led his patient, a sixty year old woman who was dying of cancer [sn9, s] to die painlessly by injection air into her veins. He did it not because he is a cruel doctor without mercy, but because he was moved by the sympathetic condition of his patient. Lester shot his older brother. George, who would be paralysed for life after an automobile accident. He was requested by his older brother to do so. It is almost the same with Harold Mohas, whose cancer sticken [fm1,-] brother pleaded with him to act like that. The three of them did not kill others voluntarily. So we learn that murder and mercy killing are conducted from different motives for different purposes. They can not be viewed at the same level.   Secondly, when life means no more than suffering and sorrow, it's better to go to heaven quietly and painlessly. Life almost always means happiness and success to people. It's no use to artificially maintain life when people can never regain consciousness or when they [vp6, s] suffered intolerable pains from the simple concept of being alive. For these people, life is equal to hell. To survive has no significance except incessant pain. Death seems to be a better choice. That makes for the reason why Mrs. Ross killed her daughter, Paula. The baby girl was born severely disfigured with no arms, no legs and a deformed face. Though she has normal intelligence, this will only bring sorrow, frustration to her innocent mind. As a mother, Mrs. Ross hated to see her daughter to be tortured in the days to come. So she made the decision to hasten her daughter's death. In fact, it is inhumane to look on when others are stuck in great sorrow. We should offer a hand. And that is to let them leave the [fm1, -1] would with dignity and peace.   Finally, euthanasia is a graet [fm1,-] relief to their family members, both mentally and physically. As a close person who loves them very much, he/she may be tortured to witness their suffering. Besides, it's costly to get the money needed to maitiain [fm1,-] the lives of those suffers [wd3, 1-] It will a great burden to the whole family. [sn8,s] I'm not saying that we shouldn't save dying people. I only mean that if the concept of living is changed, if it is not worth its while, death is acceptable.   All in all, euthanasia should be given legal right [wd3, 1-] not only from its motive, but from the consideration of the patients and their family members. After sincere studies, we should give euthanasia a warm welcome.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> 3?1/2"a  Euthanasia Should Be Legalized In China   Euthanasia, or mercy killing, since it made its debut in the world, remains a controversial matter. A lot of arguments were involved in this subject. Nowadays, more and more people accept the practise [fm1,-] of euthanasia. Many countries such as Switzerland, Norway, Uruguay, have legalized mercy killing. In my opinion, it should be legalized in China, too.   China has a vast population of 1.2 billion. According to the law of average, the number of incurably ill patients must be large. Statistics shows [vp3, 1-] that medical treatment for a comatose patient account [vp3, 1-] for 26,000 yuan a year. Just imagine how much money would it cost to maitain [fm1,-] the lives of those who have no chance for recovery, China, a developing country, is facing the serious problem of lacking in capital. [sn8,s] Such high cost in medical care would be a great burden to ourt [fm1,-] country,. The most important point is that such a large amount of money goes nowhere since it can not save the patients' lives.   Some people argue that it is inhumane to kill a person when he/she is still alive. But, in my opinion, prolonging the lives of terminally ill patients is more inhumane for the patients themselves, for their families and for other patients.   It is reasonable to live as long as possible for everybody as long as they leading a [wd2, -1] health and happy life. [sn8,s] But nobody is willing to prolong their [pr3, 1-] suffering or torture. To many dying people, death is a more desirable choice tha [fm1,-] living with agony and degradation. To prolong a helplessly ill individual's life is to make him/her suffer more, which is rather inhumane itself.   Not only the patients are suffering, but also their families. They are also deprived of a easy life. The money used on the patients, the time cost to take care of them and the pain caused by seeing their love ones suffering give family members physical and mental nerves. Not all people in China enjoy public health services. Most families get into debt to pay for medical treatment for the dying patients. It may cause difficulties to their future life. Moreover, mental suffering is more painful than physical suffering.   As far as other patients are concerned, if the doctors and nurses need not to take care of the hopelessly ill patients, they have more time and energy to cure other patients. These patients would get back to healthy [cc4, 1-1] form more quickly and suffer less from their diseases.   So, it is more [wd7, 1-] inhumane to practice euthanasia, for all parties involved receive profit.   View [np6,-] on death are changing now in China. More and more people [vp6, -1] regarded it as a natural and unavoidable process. A survey shows that 92 percent of the old people interviewed expressed no fear of death. They would rather die peacefully and painlessly in the last stage of life.   It is no doubt that the ultimate function of science and technology is to help people live their lives better, including to prolong their lives. But we must accept the fact that there are always some incurable diseases in different periods of human history. If the price of living longer with the help of science and technology is more torture, we would rather hope they help us die peacefully.   To make it legal to pratice [fm1,-] euthanasia is a practice [wd2, 1-] and reasonable choice [fm1, -1] fir all people concerned.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> ??  Euthanasia Should Be Legalized In China   Euthanasia, or mercy killing, is a very controversial issue world wide. In this debate, those who are against it argue that anyone who voluntarily, knowingly or premediatedly [fm1,-] takes the life of another is a killer, while those who are for it retort that people have the right to die. I personally think that euthanasia under given conditions is humane and taht [fm1,-] it should be legalized in China. My stand is based on the following reasons.   Helping to hasten the death of terminally ill patients is humane. When there is no chance for recovery for a patient who suffers extreme pain, is it humane to artificially maitian [fm1,-] his or her life? The purpose for human beings to develope [fm1,-] medical science is to free patients from physical or mental sufferings, or, as it were, to bring relief to patients. Extending an incurably ill patient's life runs counter to this purpose, for it is absolutely not a relief but aggravation of his or her pain. Since euthanasia is not yet legal in China, many patients can not legally pput [fm1,-] on end to their extreme sufferings and what their relatives and doctors can do is to share their sufferings at the same time.   Chinese people attach great importance to "face", or "dignity". They want their life be meaningful when they are alive and want to die with dignity and peace. Euthanasia helps keep them from the agony and degradation of death when death is inevitable and when they are suffering great pain before dying.   Euthanasia is nto [fm1,-5] only a relief to indivisuals but a relief to the hospital and even the country. Statistics indicate that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a yeay [fm1,-] a heavy burden to the hospital and the country, for Chinese urban citizens enjoy free medical service, which means that indivisuals [fm1,-] only pay a small percentage of the fee of medical treatment whereas the government pays for the rest of them. Patients who want to resort to euthanasia are usually those who are suffering from incurable diseases such as cancer. It is very expensive to continue to treat their disease in order to maitain [fm1,-] their life. If euthanasia is legalized, a large sum of money can be saved.   It deserves attention that my support to euthanasia requires some [fm1, -1] contitions, as stated in the first paragraph. First, the patient should be treminally [fm1,-] ill. Those who suffer from physical disability like George Zygnamiak, who can still lead a meaningful life if he does not give up hope, should not resort to to [wd6, 1-] euthanasia. A good example is Zhang Haidi, who is well known in China because she has managed to make her life meanful [fm2, 1-] although she is paralyzde [fm1,-] from the waist down. My point is that we should not give up trying when there is still hope, especially thta [fm1,-] can be attained by a strong will. [sn8,s] Second, euthanasia must be the terminally ill patient's repeated request. It must be a choice of his or hre [fm1,-] own accord.   Third, an evaluation body should be established to judge which requests for a mercy killing are valid before the act is committed.   Fourth, euthanasia must be carried out by professional doctors. Other people such as the [wd6, 1-] the relatives of the person who want to be killed mercifully should not be allow to commit such an act.   The reason for my support to the legalization of euthanasia in China is that only through such a process can the above four requirements individuals but also prevent the abuse of euthanasia. It is indeed a thing worth doing. [sn8,s] 

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> ??  Euthanasia Should Be Legalized In China   Mercy killing, or euthanasia is a controvercial [fm1,-] issue. Every day, there are a lot of such cases taking place all over the world. The problem whether euthanasia should be legalized also arouses a heated debate in China. In my opinion, euthanasia should be legalized in China.   Some people think that mercy killing is inhumane and brutal. No one has the right to take the life of another, even one minute prior to death. Euthanasia is kind of murder. Some people worry that once euthanasia was [vp8, 1-] legalized in China, it would cause abuse.   Frankly speaking, I do not think that mercy killing is inhumane and brutal. When you see a terminal [wd2, 1-] ill person who sreams [fm1,-] out in anguish and pleads to let him die, or a comatose person who ill never have a chance to come around, can you say it is inhumane and brutal to end their lives because it can put an end to their suffering and make them die with dignity? Mercy killing is a way to hasten the death of a terminal [cc4, 1-1] petient [fm1,-] with the permission of this patient. As the name implies, the purpose of mercy killing is to release or reduce the suffering of patients and let them die with dignity. In addition, it helps to lesen [fm1,-] the burden and pain of the patient's family. Statistics show that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year. It is a heavy burden beyond doubt for the hospital and the family. In recent years, with the introduction of reforms, although people in China have lived a better life, it is still far from rich. Most families can not afford such a large amount of money. Apart from money, time and energy are another problem. In China, most of patients' families are unable to hire a nurse to look after the patient, so they have to do it by themselves after work. This finacial [fm1,-] and physical pressure in the end, exhausts both the patient and his family. The patient not only feel [vp3, 1-] despaired because of the suffering, but is guilty for he regards himself as a heavy burden for the family. On the othre [fm1,-] hand, the family, though they have tried everything they can, still can not help the beloved one. This helplessness and pain are nearly a torture for them. Under this circumstance, euthanasia is the only way out. It can put a end to all the sufferings for the patient and his family.   As far as doctors are concerned, indeed they have no right to decide whethre [fm1,-] the patient should die or not. However, it is noticable [fm1,-] that the precondition of mercy killing is that doctors have to get the permission of patients before the conduct of euthanasia and the patient is dying. It is the patient and his family that decide the conduct of euthanasia. So eithanasia [fm1,-] is not inhumane and brutal.   As for the abuse of euthanasia, I think this worry can be well justified. First, the governemnt [fm1,-] can increase the people's awareness of euthanasia through publicity. Second, the governement [fm1,-] can establish laws to prevent the abuse of mercy killing. For example, doctors should make sure thta [fm1,-] the patient is beyond hope and get the permission of the patient and his family. Otherwise, euthanasia is against law. Through laws and publicity, the abuse of euthanasia will not become the key problem of euthanasia.   Although euthanasia is still a new idea in China, it is a pratical [fm1,-] way to release the pain of patients and families. It has more advantages than disadvantages. Therefore, I think that it should be legalized in China.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> ???  Euthanasia Should Be Legalized In China   Euthanasia, or mercy killing, refers to a practice that helps to hasten the death of terminally ill patients. In some countries, such as Uruguay, Switzerland, Norway and Germany, laws have been adopted to legalize euthanasia. Then in China, where actual practices of mercy killing are being conducted in some urban areas, should the governement [fm1,-] make them legal in law? Such a controversial issue has aroused great concern and led to an intense argument.   Those who are against the legalization of euthanasia argue that it's inhumane to do so. In traditional Chinese concept, life is endowed by parents and thus is very precious. Taking away a person's life instead of natural death is equivalent of a murder, who defies our morality, if we legalize euthanasia, it will mean we encourage people to murder, they argue, which is surely a [np7, 1-] ethical disaster. [sn1,s] What's more, hastening a patient's death will strongly hurt his family in emotion as nobody can afford the great grief brought [wd7, 1-1] bereavement.   I admit that the above argument sounds just at first glance. But on second thought, you will find those reasons are loose. First, mercy killing is humane. Death, as well as birth, is a natural process. It's not right to distort the meaning of death. Death not only means the end of life, but also means a rebirth. We shouldn't praise birth while demean and even avoid speaking death. As we all agree that we desire to live a happy and joyful life, don't we want to die peacefully and painlessly? If a person is experiencing pains and sufferings physically, is it mercy to prolong his pains and sufferings? Those incurable patients have no hope to live happily, but they have to continue suffering physical pain and mental agony. They have to lie in the bed for years, aimlessly and meaninglessly, and have to receive helpless meidcal [fm1,-] treatments. We think we're humane to help prolong their lives, but we don't know that what we are doing is inhumane bwcause [fm1,-] we're prolonging a life full of pains and sufferings. How can you be so merciless to add pains to a person who is already terminally ill? There is a Chinese saying, a short period of pain is prefered [fm1,-] to a long period of pain. So, why not use euthanasia to end a long suffering life? Furthermore, euthanasia is practiced at the request of the patient, which shows respect for personal will. Everybody has a right to die. The terminally ill patients, too, have rights to determine their means and time of death. If we use medical treatment to extend their incurable life, we, so to speak, violate their wishes and are inhumane.   In addition, mercy killing can ease the family's burden. Finally [ad1, 1-] the family does not need to spend a large sum of money on medicine and medical treatment. As the living standard of most Chinese people is low, expenditure of medical treatment can not be easily afforded by them. Therefore, many people sink into debts. My classmate's case is a good example. His father got a cancer, which was incurable. One [wd7, 1-1] to the traditional saying that debt is better than death, the whole family and his father's company did everything possible to extend his father's life. They borrowed money from others and his mother quit the job to go to hospital to take care of his father. Eventually, his father passed away and left behind a large amount of debts and the family who suffered a lot emotionally and physically. Now, this family is confronting a [wd7, -1] dilemma: two sons need money to go to college, the mother is unemployed and they owe a large amount to others. So, if they had been wise to practice euthanasia instead of borrowing money and quitting the job, they would have led a better life now.   At last, concerning national situation, we should also legalize mercy killing. China is a developing country. It is still lacking in funds to speed up his modernization drive. However, every year a large sum of money is spend [vp9, 1-] on treating incurable patients, which causes a great waste. What we spend recieves [fm1,-] no repay. As a result, we should shift that sum of money to [wd7, -1] aspect with substantial outcome. For example, we can spend it on medical research or upgrading of equipments [np5, 1-] or improvement of medical condition. In this way, we manage to spend the money appropriately, effectively and usefully.   Although there is still a long way for us to go to draw up laws for euthanasia because the current situation is not suitable, such as people's attitude towards death and the rooted moral codes in society, yet I believe, euthanasia, a humane means to ease patients' pain, to reduce family's burden and to spend national capital properly, should be and will legalized in China one day.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> ????  Euthanasia Should Be Legalized In China   Euthanasia is quietly being practised in some urban areas of China despite the fact that there is not yet any legal documents stating euthanasia should be legalized in China. In my opinion, euthanasia should be legalized in China and the government should harten [fm2, 1-] this legislation.   Euthanasia or mercy killing, [sn9,s] is the best medicine for incurable diseases which cause extreme pain. Euthanasia is a human way to ease terminally ill patients to go to heaven peacefully instead of painfully. There are three reasons for my statement that euthanasia should be legalized in China.   First of all, euthanasia is the best way to ease a patient's pain on the ground that the patient's disease is incurable. Don't you think it is cruel for a doctor to artificially maintain a patient's life, seeing the patient suffering from tortuous [wd3, 1-] pain everyday without any hope of recovering? Don't you think it is unbearable for you to see your beloved one lying on bed helplessly, but suffering from greater and greater pain day by day? Don't you think it is better to stop a patient's endless agony instead of extending it? There are numous [fm1,-] examples shows that terminal patients could not stand the pain and bring an end to their lives by themselves. [sn8,s] But, how about those patients who are even so ill that not able to help themselves end their lives? [sn8,s] Endless [wd3, 1-] patients here pleaded their doctor to carry out euthanasia so as to end their pain. But most of them were refused. Because the doctors did not know whether it was legal to practise euthanasia in China. The doctors could do nothing but witness their patients suffering from unbearable agony. Thus, euthanasia should be legalized so that the doctors have rights to end their patients pain at the patient's request.   Secondly, euthanasia can ease the heavy burden for hospital and the patient's family. As we all know that China is still a developing country and people's income are relativly [fm1,-] low. In some inland area, the average annual income is several hundred yuans [fm2,2-] But statistics indicate that medical treatment for comatose patient [vp3, -1] cost 26,000 yuan a year, which is a big number [wd3, 1-] for many families. Some families run into debt in order to afford the medical treatment for their family member who has an incurable disease. Some families even abandon the patients seeing that the patients haas [fm1,-] no chance of recovery. Then, the hospital has to afford the medical treatment for these abandoned patients. Is it better to practise euthanasia on these patients at their own request and the hospital would have more medical pesonnels [fm1,-] and medicines to help those poor but curable patients?   Finally, with the continuing [wd2, 1-] rising education level, more and more people come to realize that death is a natural process just as birth. They no longer fear death. According to a survey, of the 200 people, 92 per cent said that they not afraid of death. [sn8,s] "They do not want a long waithing [fm2, 1-] period. They want to die with dignity and peace instead of agony and degradation." It shows that more and more people have been aware that death is not a punishment for their wrong doings during their lives but a natural process part [wd7, 1-] like [fm1, -1] dirth. Therefore, most people will accept the law, if the law is going to decide that euthanasia is legal in China.   From above, we could see thaht [fm1,-] euthanasia is a progressive way to die. Euthanasia not only ease [vp3, 1-] the patients' pain but also ease [vp3, 1-] the burden for patients' families and hospitals. Consequently, the hospital could provide more effective treatment for poor curable patients. It could help improving China's medical care. Therefore, euthanasia should be legalised [fm1,-] in China provided that euthanasia is only practised at the request of patients themselves.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> ??  Euthanasia Should Be Legalised [fm1,-] In China   Euthanasia, or mercy killing, is a process which helps to hasten the death of terminally ill patient by an injection of sedatives. Euthanasia has aroused a heat debate all [wd5, 1-] through the whole society in China. Although people have various notions on it, most of them agree thta [fm1,-] euthanasia should be legalized in China.   Some people who hold an opposite view on euthanasia, argue that it is inhumane to perform mercy killing for a patient, because in China there is a traditional saying that debt is better than a good death, and everyone has the right to live on. In addition, it is the patient's family members' attempt to avoid their responsibilities by allowing to use euthanasia to hasten the patient's death.   In response to these opposite arguements [fm1,-] two reasons which are in favour of euthanasia should be stated.   Firstly, the view on death has been changing in China, and it is considered as a natural and normal process of human beings. Death, as natural as birth [sn9,-] should not be viewed as a failure. It is a normal process that everyone has to experience. With the improvement of medical and living conditions, it is good to help the patients recover and enjoy a perfect health. But let us imagine a senile man who has lost all his faculties. He has to stay in a hospital in a unconscious state and bears great pain with no hope to recover from illness. Is it humane to prolong his life artificially without enjoying any pleasure in life but pain and sorrow? To him, death is better than living. A survey in Beijing of 200 old people shows that 92 per cent do not fear death, but they do not want a long waiting period and went [wd3, 1-] to die with dignity and peace, instead of agony and degradation. Euthanasia is a progressive way to die. Any artificial measures to prolong a dying patient who can not relieve from unbearable pain in fact add more pain on [vp2,3-] the patient. So, it is unnecessary to artificially maintain life when people can never regain consciousness. When facing death, we should be frank and calm. If euthanasia can release the patient's suffering, why not choose it?   Secondly, euthanasia can not only release the patients agony, but also can be a great relief to their family members, both mentally and physically. Seeing the patient struggling on the edge of death miserably with a bundle of great pain, the family members also suffer great emotional anxiety on their minek [fm1,-] and struggle together with the patient. Besides suffering the emotional agony of losing their dear friend or parent or family member, family members still have to spare their energy and wealth to take care of the patient. The expense on medical treatment is very expensive. It is also a great burden on the family members because it is not easy for them to afford it. The direct consequence is that after the patient's death the family members have to pay off numerious [fm1,-] debts in quite a long period. Despite of all these emotional and physical sufferings, suppose if graet [fm1,-3] expense and energe [fm1,-] can save the patient's life and make him regain a good health, then that would be a wonderful thing and all the cost is valuable. But how about when you have paid a high price, the patient still lies in hospital, suffering graet [fm1,-] pain and waiting for death? All your effords [fm1,-] are useless. So using euthanasia is not to avoid responsibilities, it is the better alternative to release the mentally and physically suffering both on the patient and on the family members.   People's view on death are changing. With the developing of people's understanding on euthanasia, they gradually accept it. Still, laws on euthanasia to protect the practice need sustained improvements. But I think when euthanasia is legalized in China, death will not be painful and horrible. When you have finished your tour on earth, there is a peaceful end waiting for you.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> ??a  Euthanasia Should Be Legalized In China   Whether euthanasia should be legalized or not has become a controversial topic all over the world, including China. Before argumentation, it's better to solve a question first: what is euthanasia?   Euthanasia, or mercy killing, means the painless killing under the request of people who are incurably ill or very old. I think euthanasia should be legalized, as far as the folloeing [fm1,-] reasons are concerned:   People have their rights to choose death. Those who oppose euthanasia argue that it's inhumane to voluntarily end one's life. I admit that it is on condition that one still wants to live. But think about those people whose lives are no more than bitterness and hopelessness out of the incurable disease. Is it more inhumane to refuse their request of death? Everybody cherishes his life. If one would rather choose to end his life, we can imagine (maybe still can not) how unbearable the pain it is from which he is suffering.   Also, there is no point of prolonging the life of an incurable patient, either to the patient himself or to others. We cling dearly to life while we have it and enjoy it. But to those incurable patients, to prolong their lives only means to extend their suffering, to continue their pain and sorrow. It can be more brutal to the friends and relatives of the patient, to see their beloved struggling in endless pain.   What's more, there should be laws to protect those "mercy killer". If euthanasia is illegal, those who are forced to kill the patients under their repeated request will be indicted for murder. Will it be a more tragical [fm1,-] thing? We all know that how difficult [wd3, 1-] the motive of mercy killer it is from that of the usual murder. Mercy killer kills out of love and compassion! Is it fair to punish them merrely [fm1,-6] because they hope to release othetr's pain? It has already been too much for them to kill, there is no reason to punish them again.   Finally, so far euthanasia has become a tendency that can not be avoided or stopped. Even if it remains illegal, it will be practised secretly by people. Therefore it is wise to give legal guidance and reference [wd7, 1-] to this controversial conduct rather than to prohibit it arbitrarily. Otherwise, more unhappy things that we do not want to see are likely to happen.   Euthanasia should also be legalized in China out of both the reasons mentioned above and the ones as follows:   China is a country with the largest population in the world. This fact in many aspects lags [wd3,s-] the economic development and the improvement of living standard. To maintain the lives of incurable patients [wd5, -1] unavoidably will become a burden to the country. As a developing country, China still has a long way to go to fulfill the goal of modernization. The government still needs to try vewry [fm1,-] hard to ensure and improve over a billion people's conditions of living. Consider from a general and long term aspect, to legalize euthanasia will be conductive bothe [fm1,-] to the indivisuals [fm1,-] and the whole nation.   China is lacking in advanced medical techniques and personnels [np5, 1-] and also capitals. Owing to the facts that China has the largest population and si [fm1,-] a developing country, medical materials, facilities and personnels [np5, 1-] are in need. To legalize euthanasia can save a certain amount of cost and personnels [np5, 1-] to benefit a lot other patients. Doctors can also take more time to develope [fm1,-] the medical techniques.   Furthermore, to legalize euthanasia helps to renew people's concept. China is a country with its thousand year long history and culture. Traditions and conventions contribute to the unity of Chinese people. However, these are some outdated and superstitious ideas and concepts remaining in some people's mind, which become inappropriate with the economic development of China. Chinese people put high value upon responsibility and filial piety. There are virtues that we should [fm1, -1] maitain. However it doesn't mean that we should adhere to these principles under any circumstances while ignoring the consequences. To legalize euthanasia help us to treat death with a more objective attitude and to respect one's indivisual [fm1,-] choice.   As a conclusion, to legalize euthanasia in China will be a wise decision so long as it is done in a serious and cantious [fm1,-] way. 

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> ??  Euthanasia Should Be Legalized In China   Euthanasia is painless killing of incurably ill or old people. Whether euthanasia is legal or not has long been the topic of a heated discussion throughout the whole world. Those who are against it hold that euthanasia is a kind of murder because the victims are deprived of their lives by others, which is against our [fm1, -1] marals. On the other side, more and more people in [fm1, -1] Chian turn to support euthanasia on the basis of the following reasons.   First [sn9, s] our purpose of committing euthanasia is to stop the victims' great pain according to their will. When one with incurable disease is suffering great mental or physical pain and nobody can help him [sn2, s] Why don't we give him a mercy killing if he himself wants it? There is no point of letting him to live so [fm1, -1] meserably. [sn8,s] In response to those who still [fm1, -1] consder it immoral, I'll ask, "Does our morals encourage us to let a person suffer great pain continually on and on when we can do nothing to help him?" Everybody has the right to decide his own personal matters including the matter of death. If the victim is asking for our help to end his life, then why don't we respect his decision?   The great cost of maintaining a patient with incurable disease is a great burden to a Chinese family. According to our statistics, the medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year. It is obvious that most Chinese people can not afford the amount of money unless they borrow it from others when nowadays most Chinese people's income is not high. Apart from his physical pain, the victim will also suffer from mental pain if he know [vp3, 1-] that his family are [vp3,2-] borrowing money for his incurable disease. It's also a great mental pain for the family to see the patient's suffering. What's more, why don't we use the money, which is spent on the victim so meaninglessly, to save other people's lives?   In addition to the above, I don't think euthanasia is against our ethic. On the country, I think it is in accordance with the substance of our ethics of helping people out of their suffering. Those who are against it can only see the surface of our morals, but not the core of it. They even regard euthanasia as murder unreasonably. Murder is the crime of killing a human being intentionally. However, to commit euthanasia is to put an end to someone's life according to his own will in order to stop the great pain he suffers. These are two totally different concepts. The fact that the majority of persons brought to trail for mercy killing are usually found innocent suggests that most people do not look on euthanasia as a murder or an illegal killing. A survey (in China) of 200 old people shows that 92 per cent do not fear death and they hope to die with dignity and peace rather than with agony and degradation.   From the above, we can see that mercy killing is good to both the victim and his family and it's in accordance with our moral codes. Nowadays more and more Chinese people accept the idea of euthanasia. Although there are [vp3,-5] still a lot of work to do before the legalization of euthanasia in China, we are sure that it'll be legalized one day as in Uruguay, Switzerland, Norway and Canada, because its legalization is good to us all.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> ?  Euthanasia Should Be Legalized In China   Euthanadsia [fm1,-] or mercy killing, is quietly being practised in some urban areas of China, which gives rise to a debate on death: is it human or inhumane? According to a traditional Chinese saying, "debt is better than death." Those who are against euthanasia think everything possible should be done to save dying [fm1, -1] patiewnts, in my opinion, helping to hasten the death of terminally ill pateints [fm1,-] is humane. [sn1,s] First of all, death should not be regarded as a failure, but as a normal and natural stage of life. People have the right to die. Death, is as natural as birth and, [sn2,s] like birth, is sometimes a hard process requiring assistance. Since death is unavoidable, it is unnecessary to artificially maintain life beyond the point when people can never regain consciousness. As a human being, dying patients have the right to choose death, and hospitals and family members should respect the dying person's rights.   Secondly, euthanasia can end the pain of hopelessly ill patients. A survey of 200 old people shows thhat [fm1,-] 92 per cent do not fear death. They do not want a long waiting period. They want to die with dignity and peace, instead of agony and degradation. Extending an incurably ill patients [np4, 1-] life means the same as aggravating his pain. Mercy killing can hasten the death of terminally ill [fm1, -1] indivisuals by withholding life sustaining procedures so that death will occur naturally and quickly, which put an end to patients' suffering. Euthanasia is a progressive way to die, said a report in Beijing Daily.   Thirdly, mercy killing can also be a great relief to patients' family members, mentally, physically and [fm1, -1] finacially. Statistics indicate that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year, a heavy [fm1, -1] brden for the hospital and the patients' family. Apart from money spent, the patient's family members have to take good care of the patient day and night and [fm1, -1] siffer from worries and nervousness. Moreover, to witness a dying people suffering is [fm1,-1] realy painful and cruel. Mercy killing solves these problems.   I suggest working out laws on euthanasia to protect the practice. Mercy killing, should be performed only at the patient's request, with the consent of his family members and the [fm1, -1] signiture of a lawyer. At the same time, we should prevent the abuse of legalized euthanasia as the excuse for some [fm1, -1] uncrupulous persons. An evaluation body ought to be established to justify the validity of a mercy killing before the act is committed. However, there is still a long way to go for euthanasia to be widely accepted in China. At present, education on death is necessary to change people's traditional views.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> ?o  Euthanasia Should Be Legalized In China   Since people have the right to live, they have the right to die. Euthanasia should be legalized in China.   People's attitude towards euthanasia lies in their attitude towards death. Nowadays, an increasing member [fm1,-] of people in China begin to take a positive attitude towards death. A survey of 200 old people shows that 92 per cent do not fear death. People begin to realize that death, as natural as birth, is only a normal stage of life. There is no need to fear death as long as you have lived a meaningful life. Longevity may not necessarily mean a good thing when one loses the ability to make contribution to the society and becomes a burden. How to die painlessly and peacefully seems more important than whether to die or not. Most of my friends profess that they only want to live until 70 years and die without agony. All these show that the need for euthanasia does exist in China. People have the right to choose life style, including death, if they feel happy indeed. Euthanasia is a progressive way to die.   There are many cases of patients who proved to be incurable asking for death. However, since euthanasia has not yet been legalized in China, these patients' need finds no answer. Should we respect those people's will if the extension of their lives by medical means only leads to [fm1, -1] nothign but agony? Are we humane seeing with our own eyes the patient suffering from [fm1, -1] graet pain but still keep doing that? In these special cases, we should first take into consideration that what's the real meaning of life and who is the owner of the patient's life. An [fm1, -1] artificail life is not a real life but another form of death which is more miserable than a real death. It is the patient himself the owner of his life. How can others decide his living or death? Such extension of life has no positive effect. Statistics indicate that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year which is a heavy burden for the hospital as well as the patient's family. We are always seeking the best solution to solve problems. If euthanasia does work, why not take it? Of course, it must be performed only at the patient's request, with the consent of his relatives and the [fm1, -1] signiture of a lawyer.   The legalization of euthanasia is for those who accept it. We must make sure that different voices are heard. Euthsnasia [fm1,-] does have its value.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> ?3/4"?  Euthanasia Should Be Legalized In China   In recent years, with China's closer and closer [fm1, -1] liks to the outside world, mercy killing or euthanasia has become a heated topic in this country. As a matter of fact, there has [vp6,s-1] been a first case on it in Wuhan two years ago. A woman pleaded a doctor to end the life of her husband whose liver cancer had reached an advanced stage. According to the woman, she loved her husband dearly; she just couldn't bear to see him suffer and, she emphasized, it was actually on her husband's own accord that he was hastened his death. But unfortunately, the woman and the doctor were pushed to defendants' seats under an accusation of [fm1, -1] mueder [fm1,-] Due to a lack of legal protection for the death option, the case is still in [wd7, -1] trail. Although euthanasia is something new in China, it is a common occurrence in western countries and are [vp3,15-] legalized by many [wd4, s] such as Switzerland, Norway, Germany, etc. Early in the 1950s, a doctor in the United States practised euthanasia on one of his patients, and he was announced innocent later. In order to end the pain of some terminally ill patients and prevent some malicious people from committing murder in the guise of mercy killing, it is necessary for China to legalize euthanasia.   China is a relatively poor country with limited medical budget. It is a heavy burden to the country to prolong the lives of incurable patients, especially when many of them are under the coverage of public expense. The state has to spend millions of yuan on this single issue when the money could be invested elsewhere for some more meaningful purposes like in education on scietific [fm1,-] research. [sn8,s] Although medical science has been developing rapidly through the ages, there are still many diseases which can not be cured such as aids, terminal cancers and comatose status, etc. If those people are suffering great agonies and have lost the will to live, why should we still aggravate their pain by extending their lives?   Views on death are also changing in China. A survey of 200 old people shows thta [fm1,-] 92% do not fear death. They do not want a long waiting period. They want to die with dignity and peace, instead of agony and degradation. To those people when they are dying with appalling pain, the hastening of death would no doubt be the best choice. Actually, China has an ancient root in mercy killing. In many knight novels, those badly wounded warriers [fm1,-] would always ask their opponents or companions to kill them and their opponents or companions usually would like to do so. That was the rudimantary [fm1,-] form of euthanasia.   Time is ripe for legalizing euthanasia. A law clearly stipulating every detail of it would bring release to both the patients and their family members and protection to doctors who apply euthanasia. In a session of the People's Congress not long ago; many representatives have jointly presented a bill asking for the legislation on euthanasia. In the near future, mercy killing might turn into a nice reality in China.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1>D?  Euthanasia Should Be Legalized In China   Euthanasia, or mercy killing refers to hastening the death of hopelessly ill individuals by withholding life sustaining procedures so that death will occur naturally and quickly.   Euhtanasia [fm1,-] cases are numerous in western world. There are lots of cases of a doctor mercifully kills his badly ill patient who is beyond any medical remedy, [sn8,s] or a man kills his paralized [fm1,-] brother to end his suffering, or a mother kills her seriously deformed baby because she loves her. Although most euthanasia cases are against the local law, the indivisuals [fm1,-] brought to trail [wd3, 1-] for actual mercy killing are rarely convicted, and they are usually [fm1, -1] realeased. Of course there are cases that people who have performed mercy killing are put into prison and fired.   However, there is a trend that more and more countries, especially western countries [vp6, -1] became tolerant with euthanasia and have legalized it in Uruguay, Switzerland, Norway, and Germany Mercy killing is legalized. [sn8,s] In China, there are euthanasia cases taking place in some urban areas. Unlike some western countries, there is no legal protection of mercy killing in China, so it si [fm1,-] still not practised in large scale and inviting much controversy. [sn8,s] It is necessary for China to legalized euthanasia. Firstly [sn9, s] death is, just like birth, a normal and natural stage of life, so people have the right to die. Euthanasia can be viewed as a kind of suicide with the permission of the dead. No one should be guilty.   Secondly, we are born to enjoy life and health in the world, if we have to live in a state of extreme agony and despair which will accompany our whole life, then what is the significance of surviving? [sn1,s] This may arouse contradiction with the traditional Chinese thought that unscrupulous survival is better than heroie [fm1,-] death. But in nowadays when people attach more and more importance to the "quality" of life, the traditional idea is doomed.   Thirdly, attending a patient in hospital very time and money consuming, [sn8,s] especially when the patient is suffering from a serious and hardly curable disease. The patient may bring about financial trouble to the family or the unit where he or she work [vp3, 1-] In addition, the relatives and friends are tortured psychologically at the same time. So, according to a Chinese saying "short pain is better than long pain". We need to humanely accelerate the patient's death. This is not only a relief [pp1, -1] of the patient but also [sn6, s] the relatives and friends.   So we should make laws on euthanasia to protect the justifiable mercy killing. Mercy killing should be performed only at the patient's request, with the consent of his or her relatives and the signiture [fm1,-3] of a lawer [fm1,-] The legalisation [fm1,-] of euthanasia will also be a progress of the human society and the embodiment of human rights.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1>"?D?  Euthanasia means [fm3, 1-1] mercy   China is deeply influenced by Confucius, who stated that everyone should cherish his life and body because it was given by his parents. Thus when some patients have no chance for recovery and are suffering from severe pain, doctors and his family do not dare to grant mercy-killing on them, because euthanasia is considered as murder. However, the younger generation of China, including me, are [vp3,5-] more open-minded on this subject. We believe Euthanasia [fm3, 1-] should be legalized in China.   Euthanasia is not murder. Murder is usually an act to kill people voluntarily and maliciously to gain something. Euthanasia is also voluntary killing, but instead of the executors, it is the patients who gain something-mercy and the peace of death. Euthanasia is used upon patients who have no hope of life and even they themselves would ask the doctors to put an end to their lives because of the extreme pain, which makes them lose their dignity and peace of human life. Life is made up jollity and pain, tears and [np5, -1] laughters [fm1,-] However, these patients can not enjoy jollity or [np5, -1] laughters [fm1,-] any more. They have lost the essence of life and are living on in degradation. So why should we maintain their miserable and humiliating life? Euthanasia will be mercy on them.   To maintain these patients lives costs the country a lot of money, [sn6, s] researchers and efforts of people. Because of emotion, the families of these patients would not give up their beloved ones, and spend a large amount of money on them, who may have been unable to hear them or see them. This is like putting paper money into fire. Additionally, they have to look after the patients, which would be hindrance of their own normal life. These efforts will have no results. Euthanasia can help them to escape from this endless trap. Why shouldn't we end their pain, both mental and physical? Euthanasia will also be mercy on them.   Deng Yingchao had expressed her will of using euthanasia in her last days of life when she was still very healthy. She said that saving a patient who has no hope of life is a kind of waste. However, when she was really suffering from the pain of death, no one dares to grant euthanasia on her. We all know that in order to legalize euthanasia in China, we still have a long way to go.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> ?1/4??  Euthanasia should [fm3, 1-1] be legalized [fm3, 1-1] in China   Euthanasia, or mercy killing, which means one person stops life of another person for ending his misery with the permission and request of that person, becomes now a controversial topic in China. Some say it is inhuman and some [sn6, s] think it is reasonable. With the changing of people's concept [sn9, s] I believe that euthanasia should be legalized in China.   Euthanasia, in fact, is a basic right of people's which should be protected by law, like birth, death is also a natural event and people have the right to die. [sn1,s] Also like birth needs other's help, sometimes death is a hard process requiring assistance. [sn8,s] Some people often pay attention to the patient's living right and criticise [fm1,-] the doctor stop other's life. But doctors are not the heroes in the case. The victim [np3, 1-1] are. The victim [np3, 1-1] ask doctors to help them enjoy their rights. Futhermore [fm1,-] if abortion is legal, so is euthanasia because abortion also means to stop living. Abortion aroused wide argument in America but was accepted as a legal behvior [fm1,-] finally. Since it is easier for Chinese to look [wd4, s] abortion as legal, it should be easier for them to accept euthanasia as a right of people's.   Kight [wd7, 1-] may be an abstract thing and good effect of euthanasia is more practical and visible, for it releases the heavy burdens not only of hospitals, of the patient's families but also [sn6, s] the patient [np3, 1-1] themselves. The hospitals have to pay a lot of money and offer a lot of manpower to extend hopeless lives. The patient's families must suffer graetly [fm1,-] materially and emotionally. The most important thing is the patient [np3, 1-1] themselves. Life not only means time but also quality which is more important than time. Without quality life is meanlessing [fm2, 1-] but only endless suffering for the patient. That is why most patients choose euthanasia willingly. At that time life is just a heavy burden for them.   Most people know the practical good effect but they just hold the traditional concept, where a traditional Chinese saying is that debt is better than death. Legalization of euthanasia will be helpful to change the traditional view and make people face death scientificly [fm1,-] and naturally. Legalizaton [fm1,-] itself is a kind of death education to make people reconsider the meaning of life and death. Everyone will die some day [sn9, s] so when living is more suffering than dying why we do not face the death unflinchingly. [sn8,s] In comparison with American who accept abortion gradually after it was legalized, we believe Chinese will accept euthanasia gradually after it is legalized.   Every new concept including euthanasia always arouses heated argument among people because it is a chanllenge [fm1,-] to people's traditional [pr1, -1] one. People will discuss it and finally accept the good one. Although there will be a long way to go for euthanasia to be accepted widely [sn9, s] I believe euthanasia is good for all sides and should be legalized in China.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1>"??3?   Euthanasia, or mercy killing, is to help to hasten the death of terminally ill patients. Some countries have legalized euthanasia. In case of China, there's yet no legal basis for mercy killing. But in my opinion, it should be legalized in China.   First, to end the suffering of termminally [fm1,-] ill patients is humane. It's no use talking about euthanasia when you are enjoying a good meal or gathering with some old friends and saying "life is so wonderful." You should go to the hospital and se [fm1,-] by yourself how the patients suffer because they are being alive. To them, life is more than meanless [fm2, 1-] but suffering and death is the only thing and the last thing they want from the world. Only death can relieve them. They can't we do something good for the patients who are on the verge of death? [sn8,s] Second, to die is also a human right. People can not choose to be born, but I thing they should be able to choose to die. One has the right to determine his life, to live or to die. Those suffering from great pain and knowing no hope for recovery, I think, would commit suicide rather than toementedly [fm1,-] continue to live. Only they cannot do it themself [fm1,-] Prventing [fm1,-] somebody whose death does him good is equivalent to preventing some patients from recovery.   Euthanasia can help relieve the burden of the family and the nation. I learned that the husband of a colleague of my father, was found in the late period of brain cancer. The doctor said he only had one month to live with the support of medicine and some devices. But he was suffering from graet [fm1,-] agony. He wanted to end his life as well as his pain, but the doctor had no right to do so. One month later, he died and his family was in debt because they had to pay more than seventy thousand yuan for his cost in hospital. I think most families are not rich in China. Euthanasia is not only good for the patient but for the family. What's more, in china, there are still not enough hospitals for the patients, euthanasia would leave more chance [np3, 1-] for those patients who have the hope of recovery.   Some people say taht [fm1,-] mercy killing would be utilized by unscrupulous persons if it is legalized. The fact is that euthanasia is quietly being practised in some areas. Only we make it legalized can we map out details [wd2, 1-] laws concerning this issue and establish special department to perform it and thus preventing it from being abused. Some people oppose euthanasia because they fear that there are no specific standards to rfer [fm1,-] to and a lot of hospitals in China and theri [fm1,-] devices are not good enough to judge whether a patient has the chance of recovery. If euthanasia is legalized, such problems would be solved. The state should assign certain good hospitals in an area to perform euthanasia. Each case should be carefully examined by a special committee make up by representatives of some large hospitals and can only be performed with the approval of each members of the committee. [sn8,s] Of course, all the reasons mentioned above have one pretext. It's out of the patient's own will to do so and the members of the patients family approve it. Some approaches should be taken to avoid misunderstanding. For example, if possible [sn9, s] the approval should be signed by the patient, the family, the doctors and the lawyer. a tape or video should be taken with the presence of the patient, family members, the doctors and the lawyer to show that it's approved by all parties concerned.   As a conclusion, euthanasia is good for the patient [sn9, s] for the patient's family and the states and it is legally feasible. Euthanasia should be legalized in China. 

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 2>D"1/2?o  Enthanasia [fm1,-] Should Be legalized in China   Enthanasia [fm1,-] is the mercifully easy and painless death for persons suffering from ncurable [fm1,-] and painful disease. Though people all over the world have disagreement on whether it is humane or not, enthanasia [fm1,-] in my opinion, should be legalized in China. It should be execised [fm1,-] under the guidance of legal system and thus do good to those who are suffering.   Some people are concerned about the abuses of enthanasia [fm1,-]But, legalization of mercy killing does not simply mean everyone can do it at will, but the act is strictly confined. After serious consideration and discussions, the negative effects will be reduced to the least level. Evey [fm1,-] law has the possibility of being abused and nothing in the world is perfect. We should not overlook the positive side of it, especially in the Chinese context.   With the gurantee [fm1,-] and guidance from laws, euthanasia seems to be feasible since it is a human [wd3, 1-] and practical act.   Euthanasia fits in the Chinese view on death and life. In this sense, it is human [wd3, 1-] Humanism is to cherish the indivisuals' [fm1,-] rights and give them help in need. The Chinese people give emphasis on dying with dignity and peace, [sn9, s] instead of agony and degradation. They believe that a good ending of life adds to a perfect life. For a person who has no chance to recovery [wd2, 1-] and suffers from extreme pain, euthanasia is absolutely a good remedy. Meanwhile, the Chinese have the strong sense of family responsibility. If a patient passes away without laying a burden on his family members, he will get peace in mind as well. So to speak, euthanasia can release a hopeless ill individual both physically and mentally.   Meanwhile, euthanasia is mercy killing, not murder. Mercy killing is adopted to release one's pain while murder is to produce pain; Mercy [fm3, 1-] killing is in the purpose of helping others to fulfil [fm1,-] his own wish, but murder is designed to take away one's right of living. They are totally different. Since mercy killing caters to the Chinese value, it is considered humane.   What's more, mercy killing is not only mercy to the suffering patients, but also helpful to their family members. It is human [wd3, 1-] and practical. Firstly, it prevents the family members from witnessing the painful process of their dear's death. It releases them mentally as well as the patients themselves. Secondly, it releases them from the economic burden. In such a country as China where the social security system is not so developed, the expense of expensive medical treatment is sure to put most Chinese family in difficulties. If euthanasia can be carried out legally, both the family and the country can get benefit from it.   Above all, euthanasia is not necessarily a bad evil. The legalization of it can be benefitial [fm1,-] to the patients, their family and the whole country. What we concern about should be how to establish a precise legal system to prevent the possible abuses. Euthanasia should be legalized in China anyway.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> ?Y1/4a  Euthanasia Should Be Legalized In China   Birth and death, though belonging to two extremes, are both normal and natural stages of life. Traditionally, birth is usually anticipated with excitement and joy, while the reality of death is viewed as sorrowful thing often avoided as best one can. [sn8,s] However, these traditional concepts are now challenged by a new one-euthanasia. In China, where people put a high value uppon [fm1,-] prolonging life, this new idea of ending one's life causes much contraversy [fm1,-] It is regarded illegal and inhuman by some according to the tradition. Neverthrless [fm1,-] if considered on more practical and proformed [wd7, 1-] level, it should be promoted and gradually legalized in China. dd [wd7, 1-] Euthanasia, or mercy killing, means a person commits a homicide motivated by compassion induced by repeated requests by the victim. In the Chinese context, if the means is legalized, the person should be a professional doctor, or an authorized person and the victim who is hopless [fm1,-] in living after thorough examination, require euthanasia voluntarily. [sn8,s] Helping to hasten the death of terminally ill patient is above all, human [wd3, 1-] for the patient himself. Though prolong [wd2, 1-] life is perherpes [fm1,-] the most previous [wd7, 1-] thing for people in China, extending life, under certain circumstances such as severe pain and unconsciousness, is a harsh process. It is unnecessary to artificially maitain [fm1,-] an incurably ill patient's life, which means the same as aggravating his pain. In the United States, a mother shot her beloved daughter to death who was a badly deformed infant. She said she killed her because she loved her. Finally, she was found noy [fm1,-] guilty in the trial since the fact that the child would be expected to spend much of her life in hospitals and her normal intelligence would only make her more cruelly aware of her fate was obviously true. The humanity, which is universal [wd2, 1-] adapted, should be applied in China in the legalization of euthanasia. What's more, it human to respect the dying person's rights in regard to choices about lifestyle, including death. Since the patient want [vp3, 1-] to end the pain and the law is laid down on the basis of humanity, [sn8,s] why can't we change the traditional bias and accept euthanasia?   Since euthanasia is a means to release the patient's family members and friends both mentally and physically, more and more people began to change their views on death in China. This is a favourable proof in promoting the legalization on euthanasia in the country. Statistic indicate [vp3,1-] that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year, which is a heavy burden for the hospital and the patient's family. In addition, the pain mentally suffered by the family members is probrably [fm1,-] no less than the patient himself for the blood related affection. The reason why the mother mentioned above killed her daughter was that she could not imagine witnessing the great pain suffered by her daughter during the process of her growth. Surely, the hearts of mothers all over the world would be the same. Though there is a traditional saying that debt is better than death, and doctors and nurses do everything they can to save dying patients, including the use of medication and life support systems, a survey of 200 old people shows that 92 per cent do not fear death. [sn1,s] They want to die with dignity and peace, instead of agony and degradation and a long waiting period. Despite many people still insist the inhumanity of euthanasia no matter how painless it is, it is a progressive way to die and of course requires a long time in the people's moral transition.   However, some feel that legalized euthanasia would cause abuse. It is, in my opinion, groundless. The legalization of euthanasia, no doubt, should include a complete law system which judge [vp3, 1-] the validity of the requests for a mercy killing before the act is committed and thus garantee [fm1,-] the patients' rights. According to Cai Wenmei, an associate professor at the Institute of Population at Beijing University, mercy killing generally induced by injection of sedatives, should be performed only at the patient's request, with the consent of his relatives and the signiture [fm1, -] of a lawyer. Certain laws should be made to protect the practice and avoid abuse.   In general, euthanasia should be legalized in China when the medical science is making all the efforts to extend human life and living conditions are getting better and better in China, the nation, after all, should enjoy their life on the basis of good health instead of enduring pain and sorrow.

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> ???  Euthanasia Should be [fm3, 1-1] legalized in China   Euthanasia, or mercy killing, is quietly practiced in many countries. By withholding life-sustaining procedures, euthanasia can make death occur naturally and quickly so as to hasten the death of hopelessly ill indivisuals [fm1, -] However, its existence arises many people's objection in China. Many people consider it inhuman [wd3, 1-] to perform mercy killing for a patient, no matter how painlessly. Actually, things are not the same as what these people think.   Euthanasia is practiced on those people who suffer extreme pain and have no chance of recovery. It can help to release people's pain. The pain of those people who suffer from cancer and other uncurable [fm2, 1-] diseases is out of one's imagination. Having experienced all kinds of painful medical treatments, most of them still cream out in anguish. If a patient is beyond hope after a though examination is made of his physical conditions and of the further treatments, euthanasia which helps to end their pain is obviously not a bad thing.   Many people consider it inhumane because it is an artificial way of death. The traditional concept is that people should die without any outside force. And taking other's lives voluntarily, knowingly or premeditately [fm1,-] even one minutes [np3, 1-] prior to death, that is killing. [sn8,s] So people can not accept it emotionally. Actually, death is as natural as birth and like birth, is sometimes a hard process requiring assistance. And views on death are changing in China. A survey of 200 old people shows that 92 per cent do not fear death. They consider death as a normal and natural stage of life. People have the right to die. And they want to die with diginity [fm1,-] and peace., instead of agony and degradation. So if euthanasia is practised at the request of a hopeless patient, it is a kind help to he [pr4, 1-] / her instead of an inhumane action.   Apart from the above moral problems, there are some other realistic problems.   China is still a rather poor and backward country with an over-weight population. Statistics indicate that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year, a heavy burden for the hospital, the patient's family and the whole society. If euthanasia is accepted and adopted in China, it will be a reaspect [fm1,-] to the dying person's rights as well as a great favor to the whole society by reducing the unnecessary medical costs.   In addition, laws should be worked out to protect euthanasia. Laws should dearly [wd7, 1-] state under what circumstances can euthanasia be used and how it should be used so as to make a distinction between euthanasia and [sn6, 2-1] murdering. And hospitals can avoid legal problems by requiring the patient's family members to request the induced death in writing and by having joint approval of all medical personnels [np5, 1-] attending the case.   In all, it is a good thing to make euthanasia a practical concept. First of all, it is not murdering and can be a great relief to those dying people as well as their family members. Besides, it is meaningless to waste so much money artificially maintaining life beyond the point when people can never recovery. In this sense, euthanasia helps to reduce China's economic burden. So euthanasia should be legalized in China.

So when we are in a bad health condition and can enjoy life no more, euthanasia should be legalized [sn9, s] thus we can choose this death style at our will. To live is not to suffer, euthanasia can help us to enter another dispainful [fm2, 1-] station- death. We die peacefully and happily. So long as euthanasia is legalized can we make this will become a real act. [sn8,s] To legalized [vp5, 1-] euthanasia is good for the person himself and the people around him. It is the legalization's function to guarantee our harmonious life. Have a look at those who struggle at the verge of life: they suffer extreme pain; [sn9, s] screaming out in anguish; they act madly, throwing things everywhere; or they may lie on their backs unconsciously, simply waiting for death. Indeed, they have no chance for recovery, not to mention having a harmonious life with his relatives and friends. If not for euthanasia, others can do nothing but watch him striving painfully, and in vain. [sn8,s] Euthanasia can shorten his pain as well as his relatives' pain. The law of life consists of birth and death. We try our best to bring a new life into the world happily so we should not forget to [vp5, -1] entitled the dying a legal relief of anguish as for his relatives, euthanasia means no more sream [fm1, -] sigh, care, worry, anguish. [sn1,s] They can return to their normal life rather than suffer together with the dying. Death is as natural as birth, these two should be treated equally, that is to create a harmonious environment for them, and for the living and dying. [sn1,s] Of course, to legalize authanasia [fm1,-] needs a preparation. We should educate people, making them have a rational view of death. Forthermore [fm1, -] a thorough examination of the sick is needed. We should not use authanasia [fm1, -] untill [fm1, -] the person have [vp3, 1-] no chance for living. We should be given [np6, -1] chance for enjoying life and not to suffer from anguish.

Euthanasia Should be [fm3, 1-] Legalized In China   The question of euthanasia raises serious moral issues, since it implies that active measures will be taken to terminate human life. Is it humane or inhumane? Should euthanasia be legalized in China or not?   Some people consider euthanasia inhumane and think that euthnasia [fm1,-] should not be legalized in China, or it would invite abuse.   In terms of people's right to die, the end of the angony [fm1,-] of terminally ill patients and the relief of their family members, both mentally and physically, I hold my opinion that euthanasia should be legalized in China.   Death, as natural as birth, is the inevitable process of life. Since people have the right to exist, why they [wd1, -1] can't have the right to choose how and when they die? In order to shake off their own great pain as well as their families', they choose euthanasia, an artificially [ad2,-] assistance, a progressive way to die. Euthanasia, or mercy killing can hasten the death of hopelessly ill individuals by withholding life-sustaining procedures so that death will ocurr [fm1,-] naturally and quickly. Hospitals and family members and society as well should respect the dying person's rights in regard to choices about lifestyle, including death. So euthanasia should be legalized in China to protect the dying patient's right to die and the doctor's right to exercise it.   Moreover, euthanasia puts an end to the agony of terminally ill patients. Some people said that medical science should prolong the dying person's life as long as possible. But is it a good thing to prolong life under the condition of extending human suffering, not in order to give joy and happines [fm1,-] but to give pain and sorrow? It is inhumane to let a hopeless patient suffer extreme pain and scream out in anguish from his bed before he goes to die. A survey of 200 old people shows that 92 per cent do not fear death. They do not want a long waiting period. They want to die with dignity and peace, instead of agony and degradation. Why should euthanasia not be legalized in China to give those who request it a chance to end their agony?   What's more, legalize [vp4, 2-3] euthanasia means a great relief to the patient's family members, both mentally and physically, as well as to the heavy burden for the hospital and society. Witnessing the great pain of the patient and having to visit or look after the patient frequently, his family members are tortured as painfully as the patient. And the high medical expenditure is a heavy burden for the family, the hospital and society. In such a large population [wd2, 1-] country as China, the money spent on hopeless patient is an enormous figure.   For the sake of termially [fm1,-] ill patient who [vp7, 1-1] tortured by agony and for the relief of patients' family and society, euthanasia should be legalized in China. Of course, stricts [fm1,-] laws should be worked out about euthanasia under the condition that there are no ways to save the patients. Generally induced by an injection of sedative, mercy killing should be performed only at the patient's request, which is of importance, with the consent of his relatives and the signiture [fm1, -] of a lawyer. At the same time, our legal system should establish an evaluation body to judge which requests for a mercy killing are valid before the act is committed so as to prevent abuse.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> ?D?  Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China   In the early 1980's, a doctor gave his patient four lethal injections of air, which caused him to die painlessly in under [wd3,-] ten minutes. The patient, a middle-school teacher in Wuhan, had been in hospital for several years, suffering unbearable pains from bone cancer and the doctor performed the act after the teacher's sincere and repeated requests. This is probably the first euthanasia case in China, and it caused a large debate through out the nation. Some people say [vp6,s-2] it is a great relief to terminally ill patient, while some accused that it is [vp6, s-] a murder.   Is the case a relief or a murder [sn9, s] First, we should define the concepts of euthanasia and murder. The word euthanasia came from the Greek. "eu" [fm3, 1-] means "good" and "thanos" means "death"; thus euthanasia means "a good death". Euthanasia, also called mercy killing, hastens the death of hopelessly ill indivisuals [fm1,-] by withholding life-sustaining procedures so that death will occur naturally and quickly. So, we can see euthanasia is an artificial means to lead terminally ill patients to death in the favor of the patient. However, murder is a bad thing. Murder is an act of killing a human being in order to get money or other interests. Therefore, the former is for the man's comfort and willing, while the latter is a seriously horrible thing to a man. After the comparison, we can see euthanasia is not a murder, and it should be legalized.   First, euthanasia is a relief of both the hopelessly ill individuals and their families. The lasting life of a terminally ill patient causes mental and physical problems to his family. For example, a small family is suffering a lot is such a case in Shanhai [fm1,-] [sn8,s] There are four members in the family, a couple, grandmother and a daughter. The grandmother suffers from lung cancer, remaining her life by taking an expensive medicine. The couples are both workers, and the daughter is studying in a primary school. In order to take care of their mother and to pay the medicine, the wife has to spend a lot of time with her mother after work, and the husband is busy doing part-time jobs during the night. So their daughter is always left at home alone without any care. The life of the family become [vp3, 1-] totally disordered, and they all suffer both mentally and physically. However, if euthanasia becomes legal, the problems will [vp7, -1] solve. The grandmother will leave the world quietly without any pains, and the couple, with their daughter, will live a normal life.   Secondly [sn6, 1-] euthanasia fits the situation in China. There is a big conflict between the large ppopulation [fm1,-] of patients and the not well developed medical services in China. The hopelessly ill patients possess a large number of hospital beds and a lot of scarce medicine, which is very unfair to those patients who have chance [np6, 1-] to recover. In addition, the incurably ill patients has [vp3, 1-] become a heavy burden for the hospitals and the state. According to some statistics, the medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year. If euthanasia is applied in China, the burden for hospitals and the state will surely [vp7, -1] reduce, and more other patients will have more chances to share the medical services. Therefore, the legalization of euthanasia is very suitable to China, even urgent.   On the other hand, laws should be set up to protect and monitor euthanasia when it becomes legal. Government should lead the way for euthanasia and help it develop healthily, and hospitals and family members should follow some principles when performing euthanasia, such as "euthanasia should be performed only at the patient's request, with the consent of his relatives and the signiture [fm1,-] of a lawyer".  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> 3??(c)  Euthanasia should [fm3, 1-1] be [fm3, -1] legalized in China   Euthanasia, or mercy killing, has long been a controversial issue all over the world. Nowadays, some practices of mercy killing are being performed in urban areas of China. Some people are strongly against it because they believe it as inhumane. However, I'd like to propose it be legalized in China. [sn8,s] First of all, legality of euthanasia means legal protection for indivisual's [fm1,-] death option. Birth and death are two things that all human beings share. Everybody has his or her right to choose life as well as death. Is it humane to see those incurably ill patients are tortured by the disease? I'd probably say "no". To help, [sn9, s] those patients to go quietly and peacefully towards death may be more humane. In China, owing to its comparatively less-advanced medical technology, people still fell [wd3, 1-] helpless before [wd3, 1-] some diseases. It's cure [wd7, 1-] to see them suffering. Under these circumstances, it is acceptable to respect the dying person's rights in regard to choices about lifestyle, including death.   In addition, legality of euthanasia provides rules or regulations for medical personnel to go by. It may be a dilemma for them before the pleas from the helplessly ill patients. On the one hand, they feel uneasy or even tortured too when facing with painful sufferings of the patients. On the other hand, they are afraid of being condemned by those people who are against mercy killing or they are afraid of being brought to the court. To legalize euthanasia is also to relieve medical personnel from the dilemma. They have laws to abide by so they can bear [wd7, 1-] the practise of mercy killing with eqanimity [wd7, 1-] Espacially [fm1,-] in China, people are rather conservative. They put a high value upon conforming to convention. Radical ideas are not so easily accepted. So if the medical personnel boldly want to help to end the life of patients, they should take many factors into consideration. It's considered to be inhonourable [fm2, 1-] to be plunged into the criticisms of the mass. Therefore, the legality of euthanasia can serve as a guide for medical personnel.   We should admit that law is not perfect. But everything in this world is not perfect. Inperfection [fm2, 1-] can not be the reason to hold back the legality of euthanasia. The development of things will experience a period from less [aj3, 1-1] perfect to more [aj3, 1-1] perfect. That depends on people, we [pr4, 1-] human beings. We should not fail to notice that some evils may take the advantage of the loopholes in the law system. They may give excuse to their murder as "mercy killing". To avoid this, complete legal system should be established.   The development of society needs laws and regulations. Otherwise, the world will be in a mess. The practice of euthanasia should also be brought into line with the law. Only by this can best help those who are both physically and mentally tortured to relieve. [sn8,s] 

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> 2*1/2?  Euthnasia [fm1,-] Should be [fm3, 1-] Legalized in China   Euthanasia is a controversial matter in the world. It is reported that in America a doctor named Sanders was arrested because he implemented euthanasia on a terminally ill patient. Though later he was declared not guilty, some people thought that he was a killer. Nowadays, euthanasia is regarded illegal in some countries. In China, though laws or regulations concerning it have not been found [wd3, 1-] yet, euthanasia has become a hot topic which draws more and more people's attention. Whether euthanasia should be legalized in China, my answer is "yes".   Above all, it is inhumane to prolong the pains of an incurable patient, as well as that of his relatives and family. The definition for euthanasia in the dictionary is "a mercifully easy and painless death for persons suffering from an incurable and painful disease". The word "euthanasia" originates from Greek: "eu" means good, "thanos" means death, thus "a good death'. No one wants to die painfully when his life ends. Chinese think that the best way of death is to "die in bed of old age", or "die a natural death". When the patient is terminally ill and doomed to die, why do you still use the artificial way to maintain his life? Why not let him die naturally? To maintain a terminally ill patient's life is equal to prolong his pains. When he suffers an incurable desease [fm1,-] like cancer, the patient will feel great pains, both physically and pyschologically [fm1,-] He suffers a llot [fm1,-] from the undescribled [fm2, 1-] pains, he will scream out and feel it unbearable, he wants to end his life, but he is too weak to do it. Seeing the patient so painful, the relative and family also feel great emotional pains. So under this circumstances, can you still maintain his life, which could only prollong [fm1,-] his suffering, as well as that of his family?   In addition, it costs a lot to pay the medical treatment for the patient. Statistics indicate that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year. It is a heavy burden for the hospital and the patient's family, especially if it is not a wealthy family. To afford the fee, the family may be heavily in debts. The family pay a lot, but the result is just to prolong the patient's agony, and later to face his unavoidable death.   In China, many people approve of euthanasia. For instance, a survey of 200 old people shows that 92 per cent do not fear death. They want to die with dignity and peace, instead of agony and degradation. Deng Yingchao, widow of former Premier Zhou Enlai, said that she is [vp6,s-] very much in favour of mercy killing as a practical concept.   Everyone have [vp3, 1-] the right to live and to die, and they also have the right to choose the way of death. This right of a dying person should be respected by hospitals and family members. Now what we have to do is to make euthanasia legalized in China, working out laws about it which people can follow, so as to advoid [fm1,-] unnecessary disputes.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2 > <TYP 1> *?3/4"a  Euthanasia: A Taboon [fm1,-] in China   Euthanasia [sn9, s] also named mercy killing, which eases the pain and sorrow a person suffers by hastening his or her death process, is now in a period of hot debating over whether or not it should be legalized. For China, a nation which inteprets [fm1,-] birth and death with its own culture, which hails the former and moralises [wd7, 1-] the latter, mercy killing should not be legalized.   A success in legalising [fm1,-] mercy killing in China to a very great extent depends on the degree to which such a new concept is accepted. Obviously, the acceptance of mercy killing in relation to death, a taboon [fm1,-] in China, is incompatible with the Chinese culture and people's philosophy which highly cherish longevity. The idea that the longer you live in the world, [sn9, s] the better has been handed from generation to generation and become part of our life. It is extremely difficult to turn mercy killing into a people culturally deep rooted with the notion of longevity. [sn8,s] On the other hand, Chinese people in weighing existance [fm1,-] against death usually add to ethics, particularly for those who have relatives or friends pladged [fm1,-] by terminally -ill [wd3, 1-] dease [fm1,-] They see existence of the patients not just necessary and unquestionable but predominently [fm1,-1] consciencious [fm1,-] Although the curing of the dease [fm1,-] is at the expense of a large number of money which is a heavy burden to the majority of the Chinese people in poverty, they take it as a must to do that, as an affection the the [wd6, 1-] patient and as a kind of support for them but not as criticised [fm1,-] a waste of time and money and efforts as that in foreign countries. [sn8,s] In addition, there is a prevailing conception in China that life is to cherish, so a terminally-ill patient should run counter to the impeading [fm1,-] death by holding a positive attitude towards treatments like demanded endeavour to struggle against pain and sorrow and coordination [wd2, 1-] with the doctor instead of resorting to mercy killing. It is very ridiculous to ask a cancer patient that; " Do you want to die soon?" There is no denial that such a concept is so mighty that the prospect of mercy killing acceptance has no optimism. [sn8,s] Mercy killing is cultural [wd7, 1-1] found. Cultural factor deserves to be contemplated when the decision to legalize mercy killing is to make as a nation which closely links death to its culture, [sn8,s] China should pose opposition to the legalization of mercy killing.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> ?a  Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China   Euthanasia is mercifully [wd7, 1-] easy and painlessly [wd2, 1-] death for persons suffering from an incurable and painful disease. Many countries such as Norway, Germany have legalized mercy killing. But also there're many countries not in favour of it. Should China also adopted [fm1,-] similar approaches?   Some humanitarians will say that that's inhuman [wd3, 1-] Have you ever herad [fm1,-] a saying in Buddhist Scripture:" Better save one life than build up a sevestory pagoda"? People have the right to die. The saying is refering [fm1,-] to the savable. If a person can never regain consciousness and even he himself or her herself gives up, what's the point to maitain [fm1,-] his or her life artificially? That only means maitain [fm1,-] his or her pain and make he [pr4, 1-] or her suffer more! [sn8,s] Could it be said that it's human [wd3, 1-] ?   In China, a devrloping [fm1,-] country, there're a lot of other more important things waiting for money and labour force. According to statistics, a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year on medical treatment. That's really a very heavy burden for the hospital and the patient's family. And a great deal of time and energy is involved and wasted. If we use this sum of money on the modernizational [fm2, 1-] construction, if we spend the time and energy working, wouldn't it be more beneficial for our country? Today's China still can not afford such a heavy burden. Only when we're rich and strong enough that we have the ability to practise the so-called humanitarianism. [sn2,s]  Moreover, views on death are changing in China. People don't avoid death as taboo as before. A report in Beijing Daily show [vp3, 1-] a survey of 200 old people. 92 per cent of them want to die peacefully. Euthanasia is a way for the hopeless ones to die naturally, quickly and painlessly. The change of the view on death make [vp3,7-] euthanasia more practical in China.   Of course, to those who have a strong will to live on and make a great effort to survive, we should give encouragement and help. These people are respectable. Depending on their great effort of will, they will make the reast [fm1,-] of their life no [wd7, 1-1] wast. And even they'll overcome the illness. These people are different from the hopeless ones.   Euthanasia can help the hopeless people die quickly and peacefully. It help [vp3, 1-] to relieve people's burden and our country's burden. From a long- term point of view, it will do good for China. It should be legalized in China. 

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> ?aD??   Euthanasia is a new concept, a painless killing of incurably ill or old people, which arouses intensive debate throughout the world, especially in those countries which take humanity the first place. China is one of them. Some people say euthanasia is inhumane, but some argue that it is humane. If we focus on one major purpose: to hasten the death of terminally ill patients, to relieve the terminally ill patients' pain and relieve a heavy burden for the hospital and the patients' families, we may approve of the practice of euthanasia. But the first premise is that euthanasia should be legalized.   Why it should be legalized in China? Life is holy and sacret [fm1,-] for us, we should encourage each other to live a happy life. But when the patient has got an incurable disease, he/ she has the right to choose the way of death. However, sometimes, the cases are very complicated, we don't know what are valid and what are invalid. If it is the patient's will, euthanasia is good to them [pr3, 1-] but if it is abused by some bad men, some bad consequences would be followed. In order to make euthanasia being [vp5, 1-] practiced properly, laws should be worked out on euthanasia to protect the practice. Mercy killing, generally induced by an injection of sedatives, should be performed only at the patient's request, with the consent of his relaitves [fm1,-] and the signiture [fm1,-] of a lawyer.   Undoubtedly, as far as euthanasia is concerned, it is a relief to the patients' pain, a painless killing of incurably ill. [sn8,s] But once the right is controlled by some gansters [fm1,-] they can use it as a tool to commit crime. For example, a ganster [fm1,-] wants to get rid of his rival, he kills him in the name of the victim's wish. Under such circumstance, it is hard to tell the justice. Therefore, to leave no loopholes for the bad men to take advantage of euthanasia, a certain law should be passed and worked out.   It might be not [ad1, 1-] easy for a Chinese humanist to accept the progressive way to die. For we Chinese are deep- rootedly [fm2, 1-] influenced by Chinese culture. There is a famous Chinese saying: even a good death is not [wd7, -1] like a wretched existence. Euthanasia, in some way is inhuman [wd3, 1-] for we hasten the death of a patient. But in [pp2, 1-1] other hand, suppose one of your relatives are suffering from a stroke, he can not look after himself and even can not express himself clearly. Actually, he has already lain in bed for years. Your money is almost exhausted. At this time, he doesn't want to continue his life and asks for euthanasia, can't you promise him? For the sake of him and your family and even the society, you will abide by his wish.   Since euthanasia is a new concept for most of Chinese people, and it is a painless way for the terminally ill patients, we should encourage it to be [wd7, 1-1] practice. But first of all, it should be legalized. Nevertheless, there is still a long way to go for euthanasia, [sn9, s] to be widely accepted because many people still consider it inhumane to perform mercy killing for a patient, no matter how painlessly. However, euthanasia will become a tendency one day. As time goes by, Chinese people will accept such civilized death in the hope that euthanasia will perform its real function for the patients.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> ??D???  Euthanasia should [fm3, 1-] be legalized [fm3, 1-1] in China   Euthanasia, mercy killing is always a heated issue in the world. The dicussion [fm1,-] on whether mercy killing should be legalized or not has been arose [wd3, 1-] increasing interest among people today. Some people insist that mercy killing be inhumane, therefore it should be prohibited. But my answer is exactly opposit [fm1,-] to them. I do hope Euthanasia should be legalized in China, that means people have the right to die.   People who are against mercy killing might run counter to my opinion by saying that terminally ill patients also have the right to survive in the world. Of course they own the right. But the chance is rather minor, most of time there is no chance at all, [sn8,s] meanwhile, they also have to feel torturously painful. [sn1,s] Usually, mercy killing is at the patients' request. A famous case happened in Hongkong months ago, the hopelessly ill patient could not stand the pain any longer so she asked the doctor to do medically to ease her suffering. [sn1,s] She died peacefully without any pain. It was the patient herself who gave up the right to survive knowing clearly that there was no chance for her any more. Patients will never regret their decisions.   Someone said that mercy killing will bring grief to the family members of the patients because they still hope that the patients will recover by treatment. But deeper grief will come to them when seeing their dear brothers or sisters or else suffer great pain. In this case they will prefer the patients die with peace rather than agony. [sn8,s] It's a great relief to the family members, both mentally and physically. Furthermore, statistics indicate that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year, a heavy burden for the hospital and the patient's family. Since the patients are doomed to die, what's the difference between natural death and mercy killing. The latter is better for it can end the pain of the terminally ill patients and can also save money for their families.   Another opinion hold by people who are against mercy killing is that this act will lead to the degeneration of doctors and crime. They think the major duty of doctors is to do everything they can to save dying patients, including the use of medication and life- support system. In fact most doctors who agree to use mercy killing to end the pain of the patients are [sn9, s] to all intents and purposes, of exellent [fm1,-] moral character. They are so kind hearted that they can't bear to see others suffering. Come back to the case in Hongkong, that doctor was proved to be innocent finally because of his good reputation and his good and honest character. We should believe our Chinese doctors because they are taught to do good to the people all the time.   Since mercy killing can end the great pain of the dying patients, ease the burden of the families and the country, it should be legalized in China. We believe, more and more people including those who are now against Euthanasia [fm3, 1-] will accept it in favor of the patients, the families and the country.

Some are strongly for it while some [sn6, s] are against it. Nevertheless, many countries have legalized mercy killing. And even in countries where euthanasia is illegal, the majority of persons brought to trail [wd7, 1-] for mercy killing are usually found innocent. In China, should euthanasia be legalized or not? We have every reason to believe that it should be legalized in [wd5, 1-1] China.   First, let us take a look at China's situation. China is a developing country and still [fm1, -1] backword. Medical science in China is not so advanced as that in western countries. Even in western countries with advanced medical science, mercy killing is used to ease the pain of an incurably ill patient. In China, many patients are identified as incurable, but they have to wait for death with great pain. Doctors can keep some incurably ill patients alive, but can not cure them. And the treatment costs will be a heavy burden for the patients' families. We all know that in China, people are not rich, and not [wd1, 1-] many families can pay for the medical treatment. Statistics indicate that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year, a heavy burden for the hospital and the patient's family. Euthanasia will be a relief both for the patient and his or her family.   People have the right to die and euthanasia is humane. "Helping to hasten the death of terminally ill patients is humane, said Cai Wenmei, an associate professor at the Institute of Population at Beijing University. [sn9, s] " Can you imagine how miserable a terminally ill patient is? Lying in hospital, tormented by cute pains, [sn6, s] even no strength to end his or her own life. Mercy killing is by no means murder. It is like that terminally ill patients commit suicide with the help of others, for almost all of them are so sick that they have no strength to end their own lives. A survey of 200 old people shows that most of them want to die with dignity and peace, instead of agony and degradation. Mercy killing is a progreesive [fm1,-] way to die, said a report in Beijing Daily. Deng Yingchao, widow of former Premier Zhou Enlai, said that she is [vp6,s-] very much in favour of mercy killing as a practical concept.   Some people worry about the abuse of euthanasia. The abuse will not be caused by legalization of euthanasia. On the contory [fm1, -] laws on euthanasia will protect the practice and prevent it from being abused. "Mercy killing, generally induced by an injection of sedatives, should be performed only at the patient's request, with the consent of his relatives and the signiture [fm1, -] of a lawyer." Under strict control of laws, I do believe mercy killing will be a humane act, instead of murder.   To live is one of human rights, so is to die. I believe, in China, as in some other countries, euthanasia will be legalized in the near future.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> ?1o  Euthanasia should [fm3, 1-1] be legalized [fm3, 1-1] in China   Euthanasia, or mercy killing, which in Greek means a good death, is to take the life of the person who suffers great pain from illness and can not be cured by medical means or other ways. As euthanasia has been quietly practised in some urban areas of China, we must now make a decision: legalizes it or not. Most people would accept euthanasia rationally. It is necessary for Chinese government to legalize euthanasia and publish detail laws or legulations [fm1,-] about it.   China has a large population. Relatively, she has a [fm1, -1] numorous amount [wd5, 1-1] of patients among which there are quite a lot of suffering from incurable diseases. Statistics indicate that medical treatment for these patients costs a large sum of money, a heavy burden for hospitals, patients' families and the country. Besides this, the more important point is that to maintain those patients life by medical or artificial ways means to prolong their pain, to make them suffer more before death. Death is unavoidable. For those hopeless patients, it comes as sooner as good. [sn8,s] A peaceful and quiet death may be better than a death after extreme pain and suffering. Someone may suggest that euthanasia is inhuman. But what is inhuman? To watch a person suffering from pain [sn9, s] dying and do nothing to make him a bit comfortable is also inhuman in some respect. People have their right to live, thus, have the right to die. For those suffering, death is a hard process, requiring asistance [fm1,-] If we can put an end to someone's suffering and make him as well as us comfortable, [sn8,s] why not to do so? It is against nothing of our culture and tradition and should be legalized.   Some feel that legalized euthanasia would invite abuse. But if it was legalized, the legal system can establish detail law [np6, s-] to ensure the appropriate usage of euthanasia, or even establish an evaluation body to judge whether the request for a mercy killing is valid before it is committed. And a mercy killing should be comtted [fm1,-] under the patient's request, approving [aj4, 1-] by his / her family and the doctors. Euthanasia has emerged in China and has been accepted by some people. To wall up the danger of abusing mercy killing, the government should legalize it and establish specific regulations about it.   Many countries such as Uruguay, Switzerland, Norway and Germany have legalized euthanasia and established laws to deal with it. Why can't we follow suit? Different countries with different cultures accept mercy killing. Chinese culture, one of the most creative and absorbent cultures, would accept "the good death" as well. The legalization of euthanasia is a problem [wd3, 1-] of time.

Somebody thinks anyone who voluntarily, knowing of premeditately [fm1,-] takes the life of another, even one minute prior to death, is a killer. [sn8,s] Euthanasia would say no to this, and China should say yes to euthanasia.   Euthanasia, means a good death or mercy killing, should be legalized in China, because helping to hasten the death of termminally [fm1,-] ill patients is humane, since China looks humane as one of her good traditions. [sn8,s] First of all, euthanasia does fassous [fm2, 1-] to the person concerned who in fact needs it. Today, living condition seems much better than before. Many people, especially Chinese people, hope they could have long lifes [fm1,-] to enjoy the beautiful life. However, what does prolonging life means to a person who is suffering greatly from certain diseas [fm1,-] [sn9, s] and these is no chance for recovery? The person concerned has to be keeping on suffering extreme pain as long as he or she dies naturely [fm1,-] This is all against the willing of the person concerned. A recent survey of 200 old people shows that 92 per cent do not fear death. They do not want a long waiting, especially painful period. They want to die with dignity and peace, instead of agony and degradation. So if they could choose at that time, euthanasia is their best choice. Death is as natural as birth, like birth, is sometimes a hard process requiring assistance, [sn8,s] knowing the person concerned has no chance to recovery, you are inhumane if you do everything to prolong his or her painful life. [sn1,s] In a word, euthanasia is humane.   Secondly, euthanasia can do great help to the person concerned's [fm2, 1-] family and society. Statistics indicate that medical treatment for a comatose patient costs 26,000 yuan a year or much more than this figure, a heavy burden for the hospital and the patient's family. Heal the wounded, rescue the dying is a traditional Chinese virtue. Doctors and nurses should do their best beyond any doubt to save dying patients. But once they know no one can save the patient except God, they know anything done to the patient is in vain. Besides that, the patient waste [vp3, 1-] too much to keep meningless [fm1,-] life. What's more, it's a [np5, 1-2] double sadness to the patient's family. They lose not only their member but also a great sum of money. So, according to Cai Wenmei, an associate professor at the Institute of Population at Beijing University, euthanasia can end the pain of termminally [fm1, -] ill patients and can also be a great relief to their family members, both mentally and physically. And the patients still would not have a happy life in Heaven if they know they have left a burden to their family.   It would be a complicated process and a long way to go for euthanasia to be acceptable. However, from both sides, ethanasia [fm1,-] is a good thing. So its legalization in China is only a problem [wd3, 1-] of time.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 1> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> 3???  Euthanasia Should Be Legalized in China   Euthanasia is a mercy killing which is used by the doctors to help the patients die peacefully and unpainfully [fm2, 1-] Although it is an act to reduce the pain of a patient, it has caused great [fm1, -1] arguemnt about morality. And mercy killing cases are aroused. The most famous one in American history involves Dr. Herman N. Sernder, a well-reputated [fm1,-4] doctor before he mercily killed a sixty-year-old woman patient according to her will. After acting the euthanasia, he suffered a warrent [fm1,-] which charged him of killing his patient. The doctor couldn't get rid of disturbing by the warrent [fm1,-] until finally his license was reinstated. [sn8,s] After many cases like this one, the American are going to make euthanasia legalized. While in China, euthanasia is quietly being practised in some urban areas despite a lack of legal protection. In my opinion, euthanasia should be legalized in China, otherwise many social and moral troubles may be aroused.   First, before the euthanasia is legalized, not everyone in the society can understand euthanasia. Therefore after an act of euthanasia, the doctors and the realtives [fm1,-] of the patients may be attacked by public opinion. After all, euthanasia is an act to shorten a person's life by another person. The act can be considered as murder. In China, a country with an influence of 2000 years of confusianism [fm1,-] which teaches people to live in harmony but not in competition, taking away an innocent person's life is unforgivable. In order to protect the doctors and the realtive [fm1,-] people's reputation and their normal life, legalizing euthanasia is necessary.   Second, legalizing euthanasia can help to devide [fm1,-] mercy killing from murder clearly, which can prevent some bad people from murdering the patient. Murder is an act of taking away one's life unreasonably, which violates morality. While mercy killing is an act of helping a person to shorten the painful process of death, which is admitted by morality. However, the act [np3, 1-2] are similar. In this case, the bad people who want to murder the patient will seize the opptunity [fm1,-] to shorten the patient's life. So, it should be stated clearly in the law that euthanasia should be done according to the patient's will. Today, in China, there are many people who want to shorten the patient's life for their own sake. For example, it is reported in newspaper that some daughter-in-law [np3, 1-] want to shorten their parent's life in order to get rif [fm1,-] of the caring work. In this case, the law should protect the patients from this danger.   In conclusion, euthanasia is different from natural death and murder. No matter [cj1, 1-] on the aspects of social influence or morality, it should be legalized. And in China, a country with brilliant culture in morality and with many social problems, legalizing euthanasia is necessary.

On the table, a glass of beer, a pair of chopstick [np3, 3-] and a small bowl are placed in front of each desk. In [pp1, 1-] the north of the table, it is the seat of the host. So a soup bowl and a bottle of beer are arranged there, and the host can add beer or soup for the guests. Clockwise, a round plate was [vp6,s-] next to the soup bowl and the vegetable in it.

It is made of vegetable, shrimp and others. it looks so like a dragon, and the eyes of the dragon is smarkling [fm1, -]  The West Virginia Coal Miner's House This is a cover of a coal miner's house. the [fm3, 1-] photograph was taken in July, 1935. The wall is made of pieces of plank. It is old and worn- out. We can see the crevices in the wall. There are two advertisement pictures on the wall. On the left side, it is the advertisement of a gift shop and two scholars are standing on the earth. On the right side, it is the advertisement of coca- cola. The fat Santa is holding a bottle and smiling. The two pictures are [vp7, 3-2] cutting carefully and crossing on the wall. Under the two pictures, there is a piece of white wall paper on the wall. Maybe the miner wanted to make the worn- out wall flat but couldn't get enough paper. The flower is also made of plank. it [fm3, 1-] is clean. There is a broom which is [vp7, s-] putting up and down against the wall, on the foot of the broom, there are some pieces of board which are used to prepared [vp5, 1-] the wall.

Gary Cooper in High Noon He was walking proundly [fm1,-] in the quiet street remaining sharping [fm2, 1-] vigilance. He put on a black hat. And he was in white shirt and a black coat outside on which there was a star mask. He wore geans [fm1,-] [sn8,s] A pistol was tying on his wrist. His dress made him look like a cowboy, so capable and so efficient. As he came near, you can [vp9, 1-] see more about him. His expression was very serious, his eyes glaring at the front and his mouth closing tightly. It was so aggressive. His sight was put on the pistol. It seemed he would be ready to deal with any sudden events in a moment.  This is a picture of a young man and two little girls standing in front of a gate. The young girls standing in front of a gate. [sn2,s] The young man seemed to be the elder brother of the two sisters. The elder sister was standing there alone while the younger was sitting on the should [wd7, 1-] of her brother. Maybe their older brother took them wandering in the street, and they were all attracted by something in a gate. They looked into the gate with rapt attention. The elder sister was turning against us. She had got golden called [wd7, 1-] hair. She wore a coat with star points on it and a short skirt- the skirt seemed hathen [wd7, 1-] short for her, but the leather shoes she put up was too big. She put her hard [fm1,-] on [pp1, 1-] the pocket and her face was closed [vp7, 1-] to the gate. The younger sister was sitting on the shoulder of her brother quietly with her hand putting on her leg, and her eyes almost closed. Perhaps some children of the rich were playing or eating in the gate. She lagezed [wd7, 1-] for their life and food. Her appearance made her look like that she was in a kind of dream- dreamed for happiness and food was almost paradise for her. [sn8,s] Their elder brother was also looking into the gate eagerly. He wore glasses and stared at something in the gate. He was so sad and hopeless maybe because he knew the luxurious life wasn't belong to them [sn8,s]  My day in the morning. In our institute, the broadcast begins at 6:20 in the morning and we have to do calisthenuis [fm1,-] three times through a week: Monday [sn9, s] Wednesday and Friday. I don't form the habit to get up early in the morning, however, it is so comfortable to lie in the bed, especial [wd2, 1-] in the winter morning. So often in the morning when I open my eyes and realize that I'm the only one in the dormitory. I put on my clothes and run to the playground in a hurry and the calisthenuis [fm1,-] almost is beginning. We do kneebends, butterflies and toughing the toes. I just follow others, poor me, I'm still in a kind of dream and so hateful to move any more,so for the other [wd5, -1] these days, I get up almost at 7:00 am...... [sn1,s] After coming back the dormitory, I'm doing my bed, washing up and putting the books [wd4, s] order in my desk. Then, I go to get hot water and have breakfast. Our institute isn't a large one, but it is cloudy at this time, so many people everywhere. [sn8,s] As I hurry to the dining room, there have been so many students in it and long line before every window- the line moves so slowly and the workers do their work in a lazy way- I'll wait in line in [pp2, 1-1] patient or I don't have breakfast in the morning sometimes. [sn8,s] Having a cup of tea in the morning is my habit. Although I have known it isn't a good habit to have tea in the morning. Then I'll put my book in my desk and begin to read English loudly, but always I find it is time for class. I comb my hair before the mirror and go to my classroom hurrily [fm2, 1-]  It was 1:00 pm. I ran to the bus station hurriedly. I had just finished teach. [sn8,s] But the bus would start soon. And it was the only bus to the downtown in our institute at the weekend. As I reached the bus station, the assistant just tried to close the bus door. Oh, my God. The bus was so cloudy [wd3, 1-] - I just could see the sea of black hair in that small box. The assistant saw me and turned to the people and said loudly: " one more student. Give him a place. and then pushed [wd6, -1] pushed my back so that I could got on the bus. "Yash [fm2, 1-] You have stepped on my titoe [fm1, -] ". I heard a voice of a girl at its top when I get [vp6,s-] on the bus. "Oh sorry." my face turned red. But as I look up, the same voice again: "It is you." when [fm3, 1-] she saw that I was confused then asked: [sn8,s] "Do you recognize me." [sn9,-] I looked at her. She was short but fat, her face was so [vp7, -1] rounded. Her eyes formed a line when she smiled. she [fm3, 1-] looked so like the hudelhist [fm1, -] in the temple. I thought I had seem [fm1,-] her before. My friend; [wd5, -1] friend? My homemate [fm2, 1-] ? I just couldn't remember. But I noded [fm1,-] to her. Although, when the bus started, it seemed it had more room and the air was more fresh. [sn9, s] it was still very cloudy [wd3, 1-] and noisy. Around me was all the wall of people. People continued complaining the bad transportation condition in our institute. It was like the boiling water. But I had a habit of sleeping at soon. Now I found myself as if in a kind of dream. As the bus went on, maybe tired of talking, people became more and more quiet. But that girl continued her topic. And sometime burst out loud laugh. [sn2,s] " Terrible girl " I thought. I wanted quiet to refresh myself so much. [sn8,s] I stared at her several times. But she paid no attention to me. " Buy ticket " suddently [fm1,-] I was interrutpted [fm1,-] But when I searched all my pockets and realized that I had forgotten to carry money when I went out in a hurry. " You have no money with you? I can buy the ticket for you." again, it was that girl. " Oh, thank you. And I can pay you the money later." " It doesn't matter. Cobra. you are welcome." She made faces at me. As the bus stopped. [sn2,s] She looked so cheerful and said, " We are free. We are free now!" When I get off the bus and breathed the fresh air and looked her back. Oh, that cheerful fat girl.  Guang zhou, the capital of Guang Dong province, is one of the businese [fm1,-] centres in southern China. Many businesemen [fm1,-] from the [wd5, 1-] other provinces and foreign countries meet together here. Some make success in besinese [fm1,-] but some fail. Being a busineseman [fm1,-] you can enjoy the feeling of success, but at the same time suffer from worry and failure. It is so [cc4, 1-1] challenge! Luo is one of my friends in Guangzhou. He is a broker of a company. Recently, he told me one of his experiences of being a busineseman [fm1,-] Once, Luo imported about one hundred sets of computers on behalf of his company. But after receiving it [pr3, 1-] the workers in his company told him that there was something wrong with the computers. Luo was so worried,if it was tome [wd7, 1-] the loss would be unimaginable. [sn1,s] Moreover, eh [fm1,-] had connected [wd3, 1-] with a company and was ready to sell the computers to it. If he couldn't handed them in at the certain time, he also had to pay the loss of that company. [sn8,s] Luo went for help everywhere. At last, an expert of computer was introduced to him. After checking the computer [np3, 3-] carefully, the expert said that the computers were all right. It was just because the workers were unfamiliar with these new products. But Luo had been so worried and couldn't eat and sleep well for several days. " I have lost two kilogram [np3, 1-] during [pp1, 1-1] that." he said " But the feeling of success is out of me [pr4, 1-] description."  Poor Sir: I'm regret [vp4,-] to tell you that I hear a great [wd4,s-] of noise at all house of the day and night from your house these days. [sn8,s] As you know, the walls and floors of our apartment are badly insulted. And I suffer so mush [fm1,-] ! I think you are the music-lover, you turn on the radio on the recorder all the day time. As I come from the office, I'm always so tired and want to relax.. But it is impossible because of the loud music. Even more, you dance with rhythm sometimes. At night, there are always many people visit you. you [fm3, 1-] chat loudly. [sn8,s] As I watch TV program, I couldn't [vp9, s-] know [cc3, 1-2] the voice of the actors, but your cheerful voice. As it is falling into midnight, you are still in high spirits. You are playing cards. I have been so tired and hide myself in the quilt, but your shout still go around my ears. As your friends leave, I think, oh my God, it is time for sleeping. But I'm waken again by two sharp hit [wd3, 1-] you [fm3, 1-] are careless and kick you [pr4, 1-] shoes before you go to bed. I can't fall asleep and my night is almost finished. [sn8,s] Then I hear the noise of plates and bowls.-You [pr4, 1-] wife has got up and prepares the breakfast. These days, I'm always in low spirits at work and couldn't [vp9, s-] hear more. As we are neighbours in good relationship. [sn9, s] I hope this letter would bring [wd3, 1-] your attention. Yours faithfully,  Three ambitions, becoming stronger and stronger as the day post [wd7, 1-] have governed her thought: going to university, finding a good job and earning a lot of money. She want [vp3, 1-] to go to university because she wants to gain more knowledge. She liked reading when she was very young. And she studied very hard all the time when she was at school. But she had to drop out from the school because of the poor family, and find a job in a small factory. Now she raised money and hopes she can continues her study. Being a college student is always her dream. With equal ambition, she wants to find a good job. The factory she works in is small with poor work condition. She has to work over ten hours every day. So she wants to change this situation. She wants to find a good job, And she can use the knowledge she had learned in the new job. Graduating from the university and find a good job, as far as they are possible. [sn8,s] She wants to earn a lot of money. Her parents have been working very hand all their life. Out [wd7, 1-] the family is still very poor. She wants to earn a lot of money, buy houses for parents and let them have happy lifes [fm1,-] moreover [fm3, 1-] she wants money to buy books, clothes and even car [np6, s-] This [pr3, 1-] are all her ambition [np3, 1-] She has worked very hard to realize them.  I have been studying in Guang Zhou Institute of Foreign Language for about three years. I also have many old classmates studying in Guang Zhou. I often visit them at the weekend. Wherever I go, I always like to compare these schools with mine. And I find there are so many differences between my institute and Guang Dong Comercial College- as the location of the two schools, one is in the northern suburbs of Guang Zhou, while the other is in the southern suburbs. The first difference impress me is the difference of the buildings of the two schools. [sn8,s] Guang Dong Commercial College was set up just several years ago. So the buildings are newer and higher than that in my institute. The college also ornaments with coloured flags and lights. It is more like a company than a school. Our institute has a hostory [fm1,-] of about sixty years with the old- fation [fm1,-] building. But there are more trees and flowers. It is more like park. The night life in Guang Dong Commercial College is more colourful than that in our institute. The students there can go to dance or sing Kala OK. And sometimes they will go to the cinama [fm1,-] or go to play billiars [fm1,-] near the school. It seems they have alway [fm1,-] many things to do. But here the night life is very dull. Just at the weekend we can go to see the film and dance. The Satuaday [fm1,-] nights are always long and dull. The students study more [ad3, 1-1] hard here than students in Guang Dong Commercial College. The students will get up early in the morning. You can see many students read English on the compus [fm1,-] At night, the seats in the library are alway [fm1,-] full before 6:30. And there are many students studying in the classroom. But it is so different in Guang Dong Commercial College. It is so strange for students to study in the library at night. In the midnight, there are so many students wondering out of the school. They get up so late and there are always many students missing the class. There are still many differences between two schools. In [pp2, 1-2] the all, I think, our institute is the good place for study, while the Guang Dong Commercial College is the good place for entertainment.  Comparing [vp5, 1-] with the English course in other universities, the CECL course in GIFL is different. As the language is the vehicle of communication, the CECL course pay [vp3, 1-] more attention to [pp1, 1-1] improve the ability of the communication of the students, not just ask the students to recide [fm1, -] some news [fm1,-] words and remember some grammar rules. [sn8,s] The traditional teaching in China is that the teacher talks all the classes [wd7, 1-] and the students just sit quietly and listen. And the English course in some universities just offer [vp3, 1-] the students some grammar rules and examples [cc1, 1-1] sentences. The teacher even asks the students make no mistakes when they speak in English. [sn8,s] I think, as the course for learning a foreign language, this method is ineffctive [fm1, -] But the students alway [fm1, -] dare not to speak out in English. How could they communicate with others and make less [aj3, 1-] mistakes? The CECL course is different from traditional course. The most important things [np3, s-] for the students is to take part in and speak out in English. For example, When [fm3, 1-] the students are studying the Unit of how to greeting other people. [sn2, s] ( The CECL Book is divided into different units for different aspects.) The students will recide [fm1,-] the new words before the class. I [wd7, 1-] the class, the teacher will explain the examples in the boo [wd7, 1-1] first. Then the students will [vp7, 3-2] devide [fm1, -] into different groups, usually four or two students in one group. Some students will suppose to be the hosts. They can speak to each other in English as they are in the case of one greeting the other. And the teacher will point out the mistakes after that. This kind of teaching method can help the students to remember the new things they have learned. As [pp1, 1-] the same time, it can improve the ability of communication. If the students just sit and listen to the teacher's talk and they don't have the oppotunity [fm1, -] to speak out. [sn9, s] They [fm3, 1-] can't speak English fluently. And they still make a lots [np3, 1-] of mistakes although they have recide [fm1,-] many grammar rules. We must keep clean in the mind that the most important things [np3, s-] for language learning is communication. And the CECL course can offer many oppotunities [fm1,-] for communication. CECL course has many characteristic [np3, 1-] but I think the most obvious one is this: it offer [vp3, 1-] many oppotunities [fm1,-] for the students I take past in during the class. [sn8,s] Friend What is friendship and who can be your friend? Different people view it differently. To me, friend is a person who share [vp3, 3-] the same feeling of natural liking and understanding and the same interests with me. The most important thing between friends is the sincerity. A friend is a person who I can share my happiness and sadness [wd4, s] When I fail, he will encourage me. When I success [wd2, 1-] he will congratuate [fm1,-] withought [fm1,-1] cousing any jealous [wd2, 1-] A friend is one soul abiding in two bodies. [sn8,s] A friend is not the person who you always stay [wd4, s] together. There are some people who always stay together, drinking together. It seems that they are so intimate! But this kind of friendship wouldn't last long. Maybe they are just take use of each other. [sn8,s] After that, everything is missing. A true friend is the person who will alway [fm1, -] bless [wd3, 1-] for you, give you encouragement. What ever you do and whenever you go. [sn2,s] One true friend in a lifetime is enough. A friend is not the person who do [vp3, 3-] everything for me. He can refuse me for his certain reason without causing offence [fm1,-] I'm I and he is he. And he will not decide everything for me, but just give me some advise [wd2, 1-] I have right to keep my friend as my company for life time. We can depart and struggle for each course. But we will always remember this motto: "A friend in need is a friend indeed."  I always remember the experience two years when I went to visit my old classmate in Guangzhou Foreign Trade Institute. [sn8,s] At that time, two of my old classmate [np3, 4-] visited me. We know that one of our best friends was entrolled [fm1,-] by Guangzhou Foreign Trade Institute and decided to visit him. We had never been there before, so we were directed by the map. When we reach [vp6, s-] there, we were so tired. As we saw the name of the Institute, we were so glad. We cheered up and ran into the institute. Suddently [fm1, -] "Stop. All of you!" We were given a start. As we turned back, we saw some one hurried out of the waiting room and shouted at us. he [fm3, -] was a short old man. He wore a black coat and shorts. His bare head was shining in the sun. he [fm3, 1-] looked so ugly and laughable. Maybe he was the guard there. We came up, "Are you from other schools?" He stared at us and cried, "Then you have to show your credentials and write down your name here before you come in." We went a little angry because he was so rude. But he was in the position of the guard and we had to be polite to him. We looked at each other. God sewed [wd7, 1-] me! We hurried out today and forgot to bring the credentials with us. It was lo [wd5, 1-] impossible to come [wd3, 1-] back and fretch [fm1,-] the credentials. We are students. In fact we looked like students. But he stood there like a stone. He was so unhuman [fm2, 1-] and nothing meant to him. We were near [wd7, 1-] disappointed and so angry. We hated him and wanted to make laugh of this old bare head man and then ran away. Out of our surprised [wd2, 1-] suddently [fm1,-] he turned back. "What is your friend's room number. [sn9, s] " he asked," I will bring him here and let him bring you in." Our friend lived in the five- stoery [fm1, -] As he [vp6, -1] come back with our friend, he was out of breath and the sweat was shining on his bare head. We were so moved and embarrassed that we forgot to thank him. As he went back to the waiting- room, he murmured, as to himself: "I must responsible for the students here. [sn8,s] No one can be [wd7, -1] different." Certainly, we had a good day with our friend. And I always remember that bare- headed man.

Though I leaped to the next rock, it was still coming straight for one [pr1, 1-] Glacing [fm1,-] hastily around, I noticed a narrow opening nearby and reached it in time, wedged in and shut my eyes. With a tremendous thud the rock struck the ground and rested a few feet away from me.  Hearing this, the man drove quickly to escape. Arriving in London an hour later, he went in hotel [np6, 1-] for a drink, his car outside. [sn8,s] Informed soon of his car's being covered with bees, the motorist telephoned the police, who called a bee- keeper. On his arrival, the bee-keeper found out the bees near the back wheels and took them home. The motorist drove away in peace, free from the "black cloud" which had hung over his car.

My friend Pony, tall and slim, has liquid eyes and a straight nose. With a fine figure, she impresses others as fit and healthy. Her thin pointed face always bears a sweet smile which conveys her cheerful spirit. A born optimist, she is never easily upset or, if ever, she would not get her friends involved in her own grief. Having failed in the college entrance examination, she shut herself in her room. Two days later, she showed up, presenting the constant joy and excitement. I felt her depression all too consciously, though. Easy- going though she is, she never gives in whenever her own rule is offended. Once she went shopping. She gave the shop assistant a 5 yuan note and waited for the two fen change, but met no response. The shop assistant didn't give her the change on the pretext of having no 0.02 fen note. Angry, my friend argued with the shop assistant. Finally, her insistence was rewarded with the tiny change, somehow.  It was a sizzling hot day. A fisherman was waiting for his catch in a lonely small boat on a quiet bay under the cloudless sky. The still water of the sea mirrored his anxious wrinkly face. He had been out there for a whole morning but his patience got no reward and hope was slipping away. Suddenly, the fishing- rod shook slightly in his hand. Out of joy, he made a hasty pull at it. It felt weighty that he had a good struggle pulling the hooked large fish out into the boat. [sn8,s] The fish defended desperately that the boat was rocked to the verge of capsizing. After great effort, the fisherman, nearly exhauted [fm1,-] held it down. Only after the fish was finally on board was he aware of the approaching storm. Wind blustering, the sea being so rough, he fought to the shore accompanied by imaginable difficulties. Getting home late, he found that his wife was irritable, awaiting the fish for supper! But nothing would matter any longer for, while cleaning the fish, he found to his great surprise his wife's ring- the one she lost in a bath two years ago!  Now I have before me a full range of dishes of food ready to serve on a small round table. Right under my nose these is a set of serving bowl and plate on the left and a pair of red ivory chopsticks on my sight hand side. The three dishes are further up away, arranged in a circle with a tiny pottery pot of tomato soup at the centre. Below the pot there is the first dish- stir-fried eggs which is piled up like a small hill with a bundle of strawberries on top. To the left of the pot there is the triple shred beef-rolls-- beef-rolls decorated with shreds of cucumber, carrot and potato. The dish on the right is deep- fried chicken made wholly settle on the plate with stretching wings and a lifting head all-looking true to life.  It's a corner of an old and shabby house. In front of the wooden wall, there is a cane armchair with a worn-out chair cushion. At the foot of the chair on the wooden floor these [fm1,-] spreads a moth-eaten rug. Part of the wall behind the chair is covered with virgin paper, and above the chair on the wall there is a poster advertising Coca-Cola: a stout old man with a protruding belly raises his right thumb, saying "The pause that keeps you going." And a shockingly giant bottle of Coca-Cola stands at his right hand side. To the right of the poster there is another picture pasted [wd3, 1-] up on the striped and blocked wooden wall. In the picture, one can see two smiling graduates- a boy waving his left hand and a girl- in their bachelors' gowns standing hand in hand on top of a globe, below which there is a line reading "You can always shop to advantage". Clearly enough it is an advertisement for a drug store. Right next to the picture against the wall there leans a lonely broom with its handle down to the floor, which is too slim to hide the patch on the foot of the wall.  Topic sentences: 1. Today, violence, like a rat crossing a road, is wildly chased by most people in the liberal and democratic society though it still is a precious pet of some others. 2. It seems that most students are leading a double-tracked life, being slaves of books at school but kings and queens in their amusement paradises. 3. Society is pratically [fm1,-] a wheel being pushed everlastingly forward by innumerable human hands. 4.Educated people are apt to be recognized at first sight since they usually are cranes among crowds of chickens in most occasions.  Description of Gary Cooper in Picture On a bright sunny afternoon, a strong-built man was pounding down the street in an old western American township. He was neatly and sprucely [wd7, 1-] dressed, wearing a black cowboy hat; [sn9, s] a pair of black trousers with a white waistband. His white bowtied [wd7, 1-] shirt was covered by a black waistcoat on the left of which there was a white star mark shining in the sunlight. The white chain of his pocket watch hung out of his waistcoat, swinging briskly to the rhythm of his strides. He bore a weather-beaten face with rough outline. His staring eyes along with his tightly shut mouth enhanced the air of solemnity upon him. With a shotgun held firmly in one hand and the other clenched, the man strode steadily ahead, back upright, chest thrown out, mercilessly leaving the noisy crowds further and further behind.  A family [fm3,-] Picture In a chilly weekend evening, three persons were rooted outside the barred iron gate of a house numbered 27 in a deserted street in the old city of London. Among them there was a man wearing a black overcoat and a pair of old flared trousers which was so long that it almost covered up his worn leather shoes. He was leaning against the door and looking inside, his nose restled [wd7, 1-] to it [pr1, 1-] his eyes staring with anger, and his mouth opened widely. He seemed at the verge of exclaiming. His two- year- old daughter was sitting on his shoulder, locking [fm1,-] indifferently inside through the bars on the door. She kept sitting motionlessly except when her father's hand pulled her right leg unconsciously with rage aroused by the scene inside the door. His five-year-old daughter was standing beside him. She looked up at his father from time to time in the hope of being noticed and lifted up to share the view. She was a little scared by the assaulting sound of the heavy beating mingled with a man's roaring voice and the heartbreaking scream of a woman in the house. She kept waiting for the equal opportunity with her little sister but the father was too wallowed to spare her: [sn9, s] a lift- up. The girl, frightened and restless put one hand on the door and the other in her pocket realeased [fm1,-] her body and stood with her feet parted leisurely, still awaiting with pounding heart.  Every other day in a week we will be spaded up from our beds early in the morning and then flock to the sports field to do morning exercises [sn9, s] calisthenics to be exact. I am a regular mess [wd7, 1-] on these unpleasant mornings especially in winter when we have to expose ourselves to the harshness of cold in early air. [sn8,s] Being wakened by the torturing music from the hoarse loudspeaker right outside the dormitary [fm1,-] building, I sit up, open my sleepy eyes, peep out of the window the moon and stars still remains gracefully in the sky (on some particular mornings). [sn8,s] I half stand and half squat on the bed to change my pajamas into day dresses. I have to feel the collar, the sleeves, the button and the zip when I clumsily get dressed. Then I climb down the crunching bunk, leaving the tangle of quilts unfolded. I spend a few chilly minutes in searching for my shoes and forcing my still- warm feet into them. The music comes to a stop at this moment- a signal of the start for exercises. I jump to my feet, rush out and go downstairs, taking two steps at one time. (On this occasion I seldom bother with washing my face and blushing [wd3, 1-] my teeth.) Running out of breath, I get on the spot just in time to begin the puppet- like movement of calisthenics in the chilly wind.  I was so excited at the thought of going home for the winter vocation that I kept waiting joyously at the bus stop for a chilly hour. Before my patience drained away, the bus finally crawled into my sight. With a squeal of tyres [fm1,-] it came to a stop. People flocked onto it, pushing me toward the door. A few seconds later, I found myself on the jerking bus, leaning again [pp1, 1-] someone's broad back, my luggage bag tightly hugged in my arms. The dreadful strain in my left side of body grew by every minute. Good God! With only my left foot on the ground I had been twisted for seemingly a decade! I stirred slightly only to feel packed like a sardine. Whatever direction my right leg fought to stretch, it was blocked by numerous legs, and a storm of curses almost scared it [pr1, 1-] to death. Sighing in despair I held it back to the unearned position and forcefully nestled my face to the furry coat of a lady who was stuck among two big men. Suddenly the bus halted arubptly [fm1,-] People flowed forwards, carrying me off my feet. Those behind me pressed upon my back as though they intended to ground me into a mound of flesh and bones. I stumbled this way and that, struggling to keep balance. Then I was made stand again, but this time on both feet, which was a mercy comfort after all. But soon I was swept by a sea of heat, hardly able to breathe. Sweat emerged on my forehead. I craned my neck over those shouders [fm1,-] and heads around me in the vague hope of catching fresh air. The bus was still lumbering along the road, while my suffering was going on and on, knowing no end.  Guang zhou is noted both for its rapid development in economy and ever rising standard of living. It has more and more become a city of final destination, especially to people in quest [wd3, 1-] of enjoyment and pleasure- those who dream of getting rich at a fastest possible pace. Are things that easy as expected? Suspense [wd7, 1-2] is extreme. "Life is hard; life in such a big city as Guangzhou is even more so," comments one of my friends graduated from GUFL last year. She was an English major and enjoyed an excellent school record. After graduation she was "snapped up" by a foreign-trade firm and hs [fm1,-] been working as manager assistant. Her monthly salary is up to 800 RMB. It seems secure and reassuring, but the environment has persistently put her in a stew. Fluent English though she can speak, she can't manage a complete sentence in Cantonese although she had once tried so hard in practicing. Communications with people around become the biggest problem in her daily life. "People just keep me at arm's length, say, when I come across troubles in the street and badly need help. Perhaps they can't understand what I said [vp6,s-] but surely they know what I need. Still they are so reluctant to offer help, or, simply steer away. Sometimes I feel desperate and frustrated. It seems to me that now I have a much easier time with foreigners than among Chinese. Isn't it ridiculous?" she sighed, forcing a helpless smile. I feel sorry for her and at the same time all but make up my mind that Guang zhou will be the last choice of working place when I graduate, for I will never get into the same trouble as my friend's.  My dearest and great bore: Since my last last [wd6, 1-] mild [wd7, 1-] letter of request recieved [fm1,-] no kind attention from you, I'm writing again to strongly protest against your round- the- clock service of noises which keeps imposing on me unmeasurable [fm2, 1-] cost. A big, fat fellow as you are, the pounding of your footsteps naturally falls within my understanding and thus saves you from too much of my blames on you. But for Goodness's sake, can't you lower your voice a bit when you are drunk with self-enjoyment of singing or even mercifully make it buffed, for it is as hoarse as a crow. I've got stuffed with such kind of tuneless solo. I'm no longer thankful for your charge- free concerts which run on from sunrise to sunset and onto the dead hours of the night. I can't remember how many times I have thought of packing my poor things and kiss my room goodbye when your gang of friends march in your flat and shake the root of the whole building by endless body- twisting dances. The banging of the door, the crashing of wine bottles, the screaming of your hysterical guys and the wave after wave of horse laughter mingle, pervade, then storm my ears, make me like a coiling worm under the quilts, spending numerous sleepless night [np3, 3-] merely staring at the shaking ceiling. I guess you simply never bother to consider what a hell of life I'm living just because you are hanging around upstairs right above me! I have a full ready stock of facts to show how your cheap noises disturb me. But I won't go any further now 'cos [fm1,-] I must make up for my sleeping time at your timely absence. Your sleeping pill-proof neighbour  Mar 28 Assignment 2Friends I Have Had Friends play an essential role in my life. Now I have been at school for nearly 15 years, during which time I have successfully made a lot of friends various [ad1, 1-1] kinds. All in all, my friends can be divided into two categories on the basis of their varied temperament: some are frank and enthusiastic, while the others are quiet and reserved. In my experience, it is much easier for me to make friends with enthusiastic persons. They are apt to smile, ready to talk, and forward to help. When together, we have handful of interpersonal communications. We talk about the watchman at the school gate whose glasses have only one piece of glass. We discuss the president election in the United States and predict who on earth, Clinton or Bush, would be good looking enough to be the new president. We break into howling laughter after having gossips about Mr. so-and-so and [wd6, -1] and Miss such- and such. It doesn't matter that we sometimes quarrel about such trivial matters as whether to move the right foot first when starting to walk, because that is for sure the colouring of our friendship and our life. There are also some cooler fellows in my circle. They ice their faces, veil their points of view, shuut [fm1,-] their mouths as often as possible, and they are not forthcoming to give others a hand. I usually have to inspire them to voice their thoughts, just like squeezing at a toothpaste. On some lucky days I may be overjoyed to be greeted by their smiling faces, which disappear like a flash in the dark sky before being located and admired. Our friendship is just kept at the surface of the profound ocean and only let a flash sunlight poke in a little deeper occasionally. But strangly [fm1,-] enough, I've learned and gained a lot from all my friends, outgoing or reserved, and always have a pleasant time in my life soaked with the warm feeling of friendship.  Assignment 3 Two Restaurants Now that people's living standard has been steadily improved, restaurants mushroom almost everywhere. With the introduction of foreign food, there have been considerable changes in people's diet. Consequently restaurants vary in types. My focus is on western food restaurants and Chinese food restaurants. In view of [wd4, s] food they serve and their environment decorations, distinctions can be clearly made between them. Just as their names imply, while a western food restaurant serves western food such as pork chops, steaks, fish and chips, cheese, sandwiches and Luosong soup, a Chinese food restaurant serves traditional menus of food like rice, steamed fish, sweet and sour spareribs, roast suckling pig and fried fresh shrimps. In accordance with the difference of the food served, tablewares [np5, -] used also have great differences, the most typical of which is that knive [fm1, -] and fork is [vp3, 1-] used in a western food restaurant, while chopsticks are used in a Chinese food restaurant. A western food restaurant is usually decorated in the western style with thick carpets on the floor, but a Chinese restaurant rarely covers its floor with carpets. In a western food restaurant there are rectangular tables arranged in boxes one next to another so as to provide privacy for the customers. A Chinese food restaurant, on the contrary, is usually furnished with sound [wd7, 1-] tables, big or small, facing each other. So the customers may feel free to have a good look at each other's table manners. The lighting in a western food restaurant is always dimly controlled, creating a fanciful scene inside. However, a Chinese food restaurant is always brightly lightened, exposing almost everything inside. A western food restaurant is quiet and orderly while a Chinese food restaurant is noisy and chaotic rather than not. Maybe it is for this reason that a western food restaurant is a constant special favorate [fm1,-] among young people (especially lovers ) while a Chinese food restaurant is usually visited by the common mass in most occasions.  Assignment 4 What Are Usually Done in CECL Class? CECL, representing "Communitive [fm1,-] English for Chinese Learners ", is one of the basic and most predominant courses taken by students of English in GUFL. This course runs for two years, covering eight huge textbooks, and it is both of great use and great fun. In a CECL class, student's activity is usually involved. First of all, morning reports are given by students. One by one they go up the platform, stand facing the whole class and give an account of whatever he or she has come up with, or they may talk about world events. Then follows a class discussion centering on the issue raised by the reporter. Participation is expected from every student on the basis of equal opportunity. Then the focus will be shifted onto the textbook in which there are excercises [fm1,-] of histening [fm1,-] reading and writing under such topics as food, environment, employment, education, and so on. There are a considerable amount of reading materials in the book. Students both scan and skim a whole passage, then answer corresponding questions either orally or in written form. Listening exercise usually takes up nearly half of the scheduled two periods of class. Before it begins, a set of auditory earphones and connecting wires are joined, and the main controlling line is plugged in with the recorder. Then the teacher plays the tape so that students can listan [fm1,-] to the recorded materials through their indivisual [fm1,-] earphones. While listening, or, sometimes after listening, students are required to finish certain tasks related to the recording. Later, answers will be checked altogehter [fm1,-] Writing activity is relatively fewer in CECL class. But assignment on a given topic, [sn9, s] as homework, are frequent.  Assignment 5 On Boredom Boredom is a restless feeling of tiredness mixed with painful agitation and uncontrollable dislike. Once it intrudes and occupies your heart and mind, you'd be at once put in an disadvantageous position to fight against it- it is borned [wd7, 1-] stubborn and delights in tug- of-war, which is the speciality [fm1,-] of boredom. [sn8,s] As one of the most unshatterable [fm2, 1-] human feelings, boredom is not patent [wd7, 1-] It alights on you when you begin to hate your hairstyle together with your always lovely smile which has gained good reputation for you. It clutches at Mr. Gay almost at the same time as he loses every bit of his interests in the scheduled eight classes everyday jet fails to find a better substitute and resorts to idleness. [sn8,s] It runs all the way to give Miss. Happy a muederous [fm1,-] hug at the right moment when she gets tired of her boyfriend's flowers, sweets, Teddy bears and eventually his face, which stunned [vp6,s-] her at the first sight. So does boredom come along, unnoticeably and tactically, in numerous times and occasions. Once boredom has you, it is not about to leave, like a caring mother lingering beside the bed of her little child. You might be unconscious of it at the start, surely not after it begins biting your heart. You gradually feel the burning anger springing from no where, taste the unbearable bitterness creeping in from all directions, and you are lost. Consequently, you begin to hate: you hate the foods you take everyday, you hate the lessons given by teachers, you hate the fellow friends around with their beaming faces and the list goes on endlessly. You are walled in by things you don't like, and you kick, you punch, you fight but there seems to be no way out, for it is a thing called boredom that binds you in the fight.  Assignment 6 It happened on a rainy Thursday afternoon when we were required to have the annual medical examination at the school clinic. After the checkup, I walked out of the out [wd6, 1-1] of the clinic building into the continual rain. Slightly trembling under my umbrella in the chilly breeze, I hurried back to dormitary [fm1,-] Suddenly, an [sn9, s] Excuse me. Can you help me?" wandered into my ears from behind me. I stopped abruptly and turned around. A girl was coming [wd6, 1-] running towards me, a big bag loaded on her back. Hastening a few more clumy [fm1,-] steps she finally approached me, out of breath. She was about my age, short, slim and weakly quivering. Her tired face was met with water dripping from her haiz [fm1,-] down her cheeks and neck. My heart was flooded with immediate sympathy. Leading her in under the umbrella I asked. "Is there anything I can help you?" "Yes." She said, her right hand busily groping in her pocket. "I came all they way here for my friend. I'm from HuiZhou. Could you help me find him?" She handed me a crinkled paper and looked up at me expectantly. I took a quick look at the paper. The name was unfamiliar, but my decision to help had been made. So I asked her for more details. She told me all that she knew eagerly, in a joyous thankful voice which sounded queer to me though only for a flash of moment. I ignored that instantly and chewed at the only information that she managed so obviously hard to provide. "Do you think you can get him for me?" She questioned, a little impatient with my soundless response. Mumbling the room number 305 of the wanted" [sn9, s] person in my mind, I said regretfully that I was unable to figure out the exact dorm-building. Her face turned dask [wd7, 1-] with disappointment and a slight touch of despair. Meeting [sn3, s] her pleading eyes, my heart twisted with pity. I wet my lips and asked her what department her friend was in. "English department." She answered, then added uncertainly, "Does that matter?" "That's it!" I cried in relief. "OK, I'll show you the way. "Come with me." She smiled. I walked with her back to my dormitary [fm1,-] building. At the gate, I stopped and showed her the road leading directly to the NO. 8 boy- student's building. "You've got it?" I asked. She kept nodding, longingly looking away. It was then raining hard, I gave my umbrella to her and told her my room number. Taking over the umbrella from my hand, she looked straight at me and muttered. "Thank you so much!" Her voice was tight. Then she started out. Just before I entered the dorm building, I heard her call and turned my head. She was waving the umbrella at me. "I'll send it back to you soon. Tonight at seven. See you then and thanks again!" she yelled. I should have noticed at that moment that her eyes as flickering with mischief that an expression of pround [fm1,-] victory was hovering over her face. But I just smiled and saw her striding away. That was the first time I saw her and the last time I had my eyes on my umbrella. 

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC ?> <TYP 2>  A round heavy wooden dinner table stands in the middle of the dining room. There are four chairs around it. They are all made of heavy sandalwood. A couple of bowls and chopsticks are laid along the edge of the table. Each pair of chopsticks is put on the right side of the bowl, pointing to the centre of the table. There is rice in the bowls. Vapour can be seen rising up from the rice. In the middle of the table there is a big porcelain bowl containing hot chicken soup. The soup bowl is circled by four oval-shaped plates of dishes. They are vegetable with mushroom, lemond [fm1,-] pork, hot beancurt [fm1,-] and cucumber with beef. They all have just been cooked. The aroma is circling in the air. A cat is fidgetting [fm1,-] at the foot of the table. The aroma obviously arouses his [pr1, 1-] great appetite.  The first thing in the house that trikes [fm1,-] you most is an old easy chair made of cane. I don't think there would [vp6,s-] be anything older than that. There is an old red rug lying on the chain. The chair is almost broken. It looks as if it were an old man who had set one leg into the grave. Behind the chair is the wall on which there are two posters. The wall is made of bricks and is quite worn out. There are [vp3,-2] wooden padding on the wall in the left corner. The wall is so broken that I suspect there are two big holes behind the posters. The poster on the left is an advertisement of a drug store, with two college graduates students in robe standing there arm in arm. The one on the right is a coca- cola ad. In the picture, the stout Santa Claus is holding a bottle of coke, smiling. The two posters are put up on the wall casually. It seems that they are coming off. To the left of the poster in the left corner of the house, there is a broom, with it's [pr4, 1-] head leaning on the wall. Standing in this house, you can smell a tinge of oldness [fm2, 1-] and the past.  Under his cow boy hat is a darkened stern face with vigilant eyes. He has grim lips that close tightly. The distinguished scar on his cheek speaks of his severe combatting [fm1,-] somewhere in the past. On his glistening blue waist- coat there is a start [fm1,-] - shaped police badge. It sparkles under the sunlight as well as the watch chain hanged on his waist- coat. He has a wild leather belt with a bright buckle around his waist. There hangs a revolves [fm1,-] on it. His right hand is always close to the weapon even when he is walking. He is wearing a pair of well- fitted cloth trousers. His well polished leather shoes is also quite eye-catching under the sunlight. With steady paces, he is patrolling along the street.  The man in his thirties is standing in front of the gate with his two daughters. They are all looking hopefully throught [fm1,-] the bars and netting of the gate, as if they were waiting somebody to open the gate and greet them heartedly. They are all tidily dressed. The man is wearing a brownish coat and a pair of flared trousers. The little girl beside the man is about four years old. She is wearing a small jumper with red spots on it and a mini- skirt. Her small leather shoes is [vp3, 1-] glistening. The girl, with her little hands catching onto the bars, is looking eagerly throught [fm1, -] the gate. The man's mouth is slightly open, looks as if his mind was possessed by something. [sn8,s] He is looking wisefully [fm2, 1-] into the house. The little girl who is on top of his shoulder looks about one year old. She is also gazing expectantly throught [fm1, -] the gate. Her little arms are put around her father's neck. The father is holding her legs in his hands. They all seem to be expecting something hopefully.  In the morning, when we are not required to do morning exercise, I usually get up at 7:00 every day. Then I dress and wash myself. After that I go to the dining hall to buy my breakfast, usually two baozi, sometimes steamed buns. I don't have many choices and I am getting tired of it [pr1, 1-] When I finish my breakfast, it is about 7:30 or 7:40. Then I pick up my books and keys. Before I go out, I comb my hair once more in front of the mirror, then I leave. On Monday, Wesday [fm1,-] and Friday, we have to get up before 6:30 because we have to do morning exercise. At 6:15 we will be woken [fm1,-] up by the radio broadcasting from the loud speaker. I get up and wash myself. Then hurry downstair [fm1,-] to get my bicycle to ride to the playground. If I get up a little later, I will have to go immediately after I get out of bed. In that case, when I get to the playground, I am still not totally wake [wd2, 1-] yet. I just stand there, slouching around. But I am not alone. Everybody is slouching about. Actually, most people hate getting up so early to do morning exercise. Every body is hurrying to the playground- people stumping down the stairs, running towards their bicycles, [sn6, s] bells singing, and so forth. It looks like a panic. The only advantage is that I can have extra half [wd7, 1-3] how to spare. I can either stay in the domitory [fm1,-] to listen to the VOA or go to the classroom to read aloud my lessons before classes begin.  On Saturday afternoon, I got on a large coach and sat down. My seat was right behind the drivers [np4, s-] He was trying to get more passengers to fill up the bus so that we can [vp9, s-] depart early. He was a man of medium height in his thirties, with dark skin, short and up- right hair. When people got on the bus to see whether there was an empty seat and hesitated, he grated [wd7, 1-] their hands, and poointed [fm1, -] to the near part of the bus "look! There are a lot of empty seats over there, you can't see them right here. Go in and I promise you can find me." I guessed he was a peasant who bought or contract [vp1, 1-1] this bus. When he turned back his head, detected the shrewdness in his eyes. [sn8,s] Soon the bus was full and we were on the motorway. There was a traffic conjunction at the exit of the motorway. Thousands of vehicles pulled up in front of us. Our bus had to stop and queue up. The traffic got to a standstill without any least [wd5, 1-] movement. In the meantime, a police car sprong [fm1,-] up behind us and jumped [wd7, 1-] the queue. The driver was quite annoyed by it "Damn the cops, bandits!" Very very slowly, the traffic was crawling forward. But the traffic valley which we were in was stuck. The mini bus in front of us collided with another coach. Both driver sticked [wd7, 1-] out his head from the window and called out: "Hei! Get moving, damn it!" But it did not work. He got off the bus and trudged to them. After while, he came back. The bus in front of us moved aside and we were out.  I think working in Guangzhou is good if you are hard-working. Guangzhou is becoming a kind of melting pot where everyone come [vp3, 1-] to try their luck. It provides you with oppotunities [fm1, -] It is an ideal place to fulfil [vp1, 1-3] your potential abilities. I have a cusin [fm1,-] who is a businessman on tailoring. He has worked in Guangzhou for 8 years and has been sucessful [fm1, -] He owns several large tailors shops in Shahe district, Guangzhou. When he first came here, he began his way by opening a boutique. It's really hard work. He had to wake up early in the morning and work late into the night, in order to seplenish [fm1,-] his stook [fm1,-] he had to ride a motorcycle for almost 2,00 killometres [fm1,-] to get to the factory. Gradually., his wealth was growing. He has made a lot of achievement. But because of his over-work, he had problems in his health. His hair coming off. [sn8,s] Now he has to wear a wig. When I asked him about that, he laughed satisfiedly [fm2, 1-] and pulled off the wig, revealing his "naked" head, and said:" I've made it and I won't regret".  Dear Gentleman,        Tue [sn9, s] 15 I am sincerely [wd5, 1-] writing to you to make a complain [wd2, 1-] on the noise that disturbs me. I am living in the flat right under yours. I do think that you are a great musician and I like music too. But I feel abliged [fm1,-] to tell you that I don't very much get used to your pratising [fm1,-] the instrument so early. Every morning at half past five when I am still having a sound sleep, the blerring [wd7, 1-] of a trumpet will squeeze into my ears and drive me out of my bed. And I can't get back to sleep anymore. The whole day that follows I will remain drowsy and tired. I think I can make it up by going to bed early in the evening. But I couldn't because of the noise from upstairs. It seems that you have been inviting some energetic friends to your party these days. Perhaps we should blame on the dadly [fm1,-] insulted [wd3, 1-] floor, but I just can't get into sleep with all these noise [np3, 1-] I wonder if you can do me a favour. Could you not blew your trumpet so early in the morning? And I will be so thankful if you can have your parties early in the day or have it somewhere else. I will really appreciate it. Yours Sincerely Ruan Harris  Friends I Have Had I have had three types of friends: First [fm3, 1-] close friend [np6, 1-] or intimate friend; second, cooperative friends; third, acquaintances. It is quite lucky to have just one or two close or intimate friends in your whole life. They are friends whom you can trust. You can share your secree [fm1,-] and passion with them. No matter what happen to you, whether [cj1, 1-] you become rich, poor, strong, weak, they will never desere [fm1,-] you. The friendship between [pp1, 1-] you is priceless and eternal. The second type [wd4, s] friends are those whose friendship with you is based on common ground. For example, you are working with your colleagues on a certain project. The friendship develops during the cooperation. These friends are also important to you, because you can share the feeling of failure and sucess [fm1,-] with them. And they might become your close friend [np3, s-] too. The third type of friends are the ones who you know throught [fm1,-] others or by other means, like the person you often meet on the bus, your neighbour, the one you play tennis with. The friendship in between is not deep. Sometimes they can offer you help and information, and you won't feel lonely. There is no clear distiction [fm1,-] between these three types of friends. Your acquaintance might turn out to be your close friend one day, nobody knows. All depends.  The restaurent [fm1,-] outside our campus and the restaurent [fm1,-] near my home are quite different, but they both offer a lot of convenience to their customers. Many drivers go to these two restaurents [fm1,-] because they are located near the road. Drivers can stop by and have their meal. You may see a lot of students in the restaurent [fm1,-] outside our campus, but you will never see this phenomenon in the restaurent [fm1,-] near my home. Instead, you may see a lot of families going there for morning tea. The facilities in the restaurent [fm1,-] near campus is a little crude, but the price is cheap. In compassion [wd3, 1-] the restaurent [fm1,-] near my home is expensive, but it has an [np7, 1-3] more comfortable environment. Students enjoy cheap price while the people in my city enjoy comfortness [fm2, 1-] Both restaurents [fm1,-] meet their purpose. The retaurent [fm1,-] outside our campus is self-imployed [fm1,-] business while the one near my home is state-runed [fm1,-] Dispite [fm1,-] the difference in ownership, they both offer good service. In the restaurent [fm1,-] outside campus, a waitress will come to serve you as soon as you sit down. She offers you menus, lay [vp3, 1-] out the bowls and chopsticks for you. It differs slightly in the restaurent [fm1, -] near my home. A waiter in red jacket will bow you in. Then a smiling waitress will show you to your table. Another waitress will come at your service afterwards. Of course, you pay more for this. But you will have the feeling of being an honoured guest.  The core course for the English major in GUFL is CECL- Communicative English for Chinese Learners. This is a two- year course, including eight book [np3, 1-] This course is different from courses like extensive reading, grammar, writing, listening, oral class, etc. Actually, CECL covers all the aspects from oral English, writing, listening, reading and translating. It aims to train a students [np3, 1-] who can speak English properly, who is able to read and write some practical articles, who can behave properly in certain occassions [fm1,-] CECL is an active class involving all kinds of activities. Sometimes we have to listen to a conversation, sometimes we have to write an artical [fm1,-] sometimes we have a debate. The purpose of this course is to give the students a basic education of the western culture. And to teach the students how to deal with the foreigners. [sn2,s] Because CECL covers a wild range of knowledge, some students complained that there too many new words. [sn8,s] But I would say once we really make effort and try to do a good jot of it, we are the people who benefit most.  When you feel that you have nothing to do and nothing can arouse your interest [sn9, s] that feeling can be described as boredom. When you get bored, you will always try to create something to kill the time. Because you don't have a clear object in mind, what you will do is usaully [fm1,-] purposeless and even harmful to others. So boredom is often connected with immorality, lifelessness [fm2, 1-] or even crime. Boredom is human being's enemy. It spoils and destroys a person. A person with this feeling can not think, does not know that he can not think. He has no aim, no purpose, no stimulation, in an other word- lifeless [wd2, 1-] It is impossible for human being [np6, 1-] to avoid boredom because it [pr1, 1-] live [vp3, 1-] with this society. Where there is mankind, there is boredom. But it is possible to forget it. If you are too sensitive to boredom, you will be trapped in the situation. This will bring disaster. Do not try to run away from ie [wd7, 1-] stay where you are and leave it as it is. Do not try to do something but rather consider what you should not do.  I remember when I was in primary school, I was a delinquent student. Whe [fm1, -] the [pr1,-] rule was broken by me, I was requested by the teacher to write a self-criticized report with my parent's signiture [fm1,-] on it. My father got annoyed signing my self-criticized reports so frequently. "Why can't you stop doing it?" he said. One day, I picked up a piece of fruit growing on campus and was caught. I was one of the gang. The teacher had us standing in front of him in a line. We were all like defeated soldiers with our heads down and eyes focusing on our shoes. Then the teacher began to address us, "Now, listen! Every one of you go back and write a self-criticized report. Have your parent signed [vp5, 1-] it and bring it to me tomorrow. " "But I have only picked up one piece," I protested tentatively, "Do I also have to write a report?" The teacher turned to me with surprise and then asked me to step forward. He said, "If every one of the student in our school pick up just one as you did, there will be nothing left on the tree." I dared not say anything. But I thought he was being ridiculous. He often told us that if every student in the classroom just talked for one minute, 45 students will take 45 minutes and we had no time to have class. I often retorted, "If we talk at the same time, then we will have 44 minutes left to have class." Now he is using that "If" again. But this time I could not think out a smart answer to retore [fm1,-] him. Besides, I did not want to write another report. So I did say anything but I thought, "If the students do not pick up the fruits, the teache [fm1,-] will do it anyway. Suppose every teacher pick [vp3, 1-] up one or two pieces, what will happen?" I helped myself from laughing till we were dismissed. Anyone [wd7, 1-] I brought my self-criticized report to my father to sign. This time he signed it and said laughingly [sn9, s] " You gluttonous kid. Didn't I feed you enough food at home?" 

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GIFL> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC ?> <TYP 2>  The other day I met Rosa, my former roommate. Both of us were very glad and exclaimed with excitement, for we hadn't seen each other since her graduation. She was roughly the same as before, but I noticed some small changes: She wore expensive jacket and the most fashionable high-heel boots; she had put on makeup on her face; and when I asked her to go around for a walk, she even took out a lip-stick and applied it to her mouth. I said rather jokingly: " Well, you are very modern." She answered: " I have to. But if you had met my colleagues, you wouldn't have said so. My makeup was nothing compared with theirs." I was shocked, for Rosa was a primary school teacher in Guang zhou "Her colleagues" of course refer to the teachers in her school. It was quite different from my impression of what primary school teachers should be like. I invited her to a canteen and ordered some fried cookies and the like- that was her favourite. But she didn't take any- "I have to protect my voice, these things will cause me sore throat." She said. Her voice was a bit husky now, but she used to have a voice as sweet as a nightingale. What changes! Then she began to tell me about her job, her life. "I am now teaching the 3rd, 4th and 5th grades English. I have 18 classes a week and my total income is 600 yuan- barely enough to live on. The school doesn't provide lodging, so I have to live in my uncle's house, sharing a 9 m^2 room with my cousin. They are good to me, but after all, it isn't my own home. At noon, I sleep in my office, at first on the desks, but now the school gives me a folding bed." "The students are very naughty. The headmaster is afraid of their parents- they threaten to lodge complaints to the city's Education Bureau if their children are punished. Once I lost temper and twisted a student's ear- I got a kind of satisfaction from it. One has to give vent to his anger which is long suppressed, luckily, the student did not report to the headmaster. [sn1,s] Neither did the other teachers. In the office, I'd better keep my mouth closed. They told me some teachers are the heamasters's [fm1,-] eyes and ears who will report to him if there is any thing slightly improper. When young teachers are together, they have nothing to talk about except gossip and senseless jokes." There was some kind of contempt in her expression when saying this. She continued with a sigh: " But most of the students are lovely. During the break they always ask me lots of questions. When going out for picnic, they always put the best food in my plate and every one wants to take a photo with me. That's the sweet side of being a teacher. Teaching is really hard work if one wants to teach well. Everyday I correct the homework and prepare for the new lessons. It leaves me no time to watch TV or to write a letter. Every night when I go to bed, I feel dog tired. I've almost forgotten what I had learnt at school- every day I deal with A. B. C and other simplest words. Isn't it a kind of tragedy? Sometimes I dread that I have to teach all my life. I've always thought that when one is young, he should experience more and enjoy more exciting life than just be confined to a narrow space. Then, when new acquainces [fm1,-] ask me about my job, I can never say proudly that I am a primary school teacher- It [fm3, 1-] is not something to be proud of, but rather something to be ashamed of in other people's eyes. The teachers' status is still very low despite the government effort to improve it," "When I was a student, I longed to work; [sn9, s] Now I work, I long to be a student. How ridiculous! But at least being a student means that I don't have so much responsibility, so much pressure and that I don't have to deal with the complicated relationship between people. How I wish I could be a student again! Cathie, keep an eye for me if there is any such opportunities." Rosa grasped my hand and said seriously. I, of course, promised her to help whenever I could. In fact, I myself hate teaching- it requires so much patience, endurance, hard work, knowledge and skill that except those who are born with teaching talents, probably few can do well. Besides, considering the amount of work, the salary, the status and other treatment of teachers are too low. "Rosa, I wish you good luck in finding a new, satisfactory job." I said at parting. " The same to you when you graduate." She answered, leaving me a brilliant smile.  March 15, 1994 Dear sir, I rented Flat 101 in your apartment building six months ago. Everything is satisfactory except the terrible noise at all time. It is driving me crazy. At 5 am. every morning, I am woken up by a sharp noise as if something is scratching the floor. My upstair [fm1,-] neighbors are early birds. They do morning exercise [np6, 1-] at home by pushing the furniture from this end to that end for about 1/2 hour. It is the chairs that are making the noise. Then there comes the noise of cooking: the "ping" and "pang"s of the cooking utensils, the "bob"s [fm2, 1-] of the oil boiling and so on. When they are having breakfast, they make a lot of noises too, as if they were devouring their food. As soon as they finish, TV is on. Football games, soap operas like "The Dynasty", UN's peace-keeping force in Somalia, advertisement for the new film "The bodyguard", etc. Someone's watching TV all day. Then in the evening, there will be quarrels. The housewife would say " I must be blind to have married you". The husband would curse: " You silly pig." Their one-year-old baby join the choir by crying. Then there will be screaming or shouting, sometimes the breaking of a glass. Evening parties are as often as daily meals. There will be jazz music. Young guys keep coming in and going out, always slamming the door and making a "bang". If there happens to be someone knocking the door, he's knocking loudly. Someone will be dancing, whether on purpose or not, their feet strike the floor heavily. There will be "Cheers" [fm3, 1-] and "bottoms up". When the party ends, there will be dispute over who's going to clear up the mess. Sometimes a shoe will be thrown to the floor before water splashes out and the washing begins. Don't say I haven't done anything to prevent it. I've written two letters to complain. In the second one, I even threatened to tell the police. Those letters recieved [fm1,-] no answer. Everything remains the same. I have to turn to you. I hate to break the lease, but the walls and floors are too badly insulated and the noise is more than I van [fm1,-] bear. If you were in my shoe, you would act likewise. Would you arrange an appointment so that we can settle the matter as soon as possible? Looking forward to your prompt action. Yours truly,.....  Friends I Have Had Sincerity, understanding and helpfulness are what I'm looking for in a friend. In truth, three kinds of friends have surrounded me all along: The [fm3, 1-] true ones, the false ones and the casual ones. I've tried to find true friends all my life- those that love me, understand me and help me whenever possible. To me, they are like beacon light on the misty sea, guiding my way through. They can be trusted and be relied on. So far, I've found several. Annie is one. Although she's in Hainan Island, yet we write to each other quite often. She would tell me she gets an "A" in essay writing. She and Mary go to the school to pick roses and are caught on the spot; She meets an interesting fellow on the bus the other day. I would say I get a part-time job as a tutor, computer lessons so far proves a headache for me; I lose my temper easily these few weeks. She would immediately write back saying: " Don't worry. You'll catch up in no time.... Every time you are angry, count 100 times before you say or do anything. Be good to yourself and others...." She's the one that I can trust everything with. When I do something wrong. [sn9, s] I tell her, for she won't ridicule me; to her, I succeed in something. [sn8,s] T [wd7, 1-] tell her, for she will share my happiness; when I'm upset, I tell her, for she will cheer me up. Bosom friends are not easy to find, but once I find one, I no longer feel life is a dull game. I no longer feel I'm walking alone in this busy world. No one's perfect. Knowing the real "me" and still cherish me, they are the most-valued friends. Besides true friends, I also have false friends. I don't seek them, they come themselves, usually with a disguise. They say [sn9, s] You're great. You're wonderful "to my face, but behind me they tell another story: " She has no taste. She's not practical..." When I achieved something, they would be jealous and adopted a kind of the unattainable- grape- is- sour attitude. They claim be helpful friends but when I really to them, they turn away. [sn8,s] It hurts when I find out the truth that they are no friends at all and I've so naively put so much faith in them. I still remember how disappointed I was when I overheard my seemingly closest friend reporting to the teacher that I red novels in class, and later I discovered that my lost pencil- box found its way in her house. That was something happening in primary school. Yet it keeps coming back to my mind and it hurts- not because of the report or the pencil- box itself, but because the friendship I sincerely believe in had been shaken, I've been warned not to make false friends. Yet I'm not that wise as can avoid them all. [sn8,s] The above two kinds are relatively fewer. Most of my friends are casual acquaintances. Some of them I meet on the train. Conversations range from childhood experience of hitting 3 birds with one stone to ambitions to be a millionaire. Very often we exchange addresses and seriously promise to write letters. Yet they are out of sight, out of mind. Some of them when I meet I'll say hello to. Maybe I know their names and something about them, maybe I know nothing at all. The point is it's good to exchange greetings and smiles. Some of them are old classmates or colleagues. They are familiar to me. I know whether they prefer fishing or dancing, I know when they've moved to a new house and how much their new round lat [wd7, 1-] cost them. I may go with them to barbecue on Baiyun Mountain. Yet there are no heart- to-heart talks between us. They won't care whether I'm in good mood or not and I won't trouble myself to find out what they really think or feel. We keep a distance in between, not too close, not too far away. There are the friends I've had. I can not demand every one of them to be sincere and helpful always. Anyway, no one has that obligation. But they've made my life colorful and on the whole, I should have nothing to complain.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH ZD> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (t1-1)  	Crime appeared with the evolvement of the human society. No matter in what kind of society, the reasons why people commit crimes are nearly the same. Those people take the risk either for material and spiritual benefits, or for the sense of excitement. But even they have got what they want from a crime, crime does not pay.  	Criminals are destined to be punished by law. Nowadays, the police force has increased, the detecting techniques have been improved, people's awarness [fm1,-] of the seriousness of crimes has been aroused, So most criminals cannot escape their deserved punishment. Furthermore, as a deterrent to future criminals, law has become more and more severe. Criminals are now taking the risk of spending years behind bars or even being executed. It is really too long and too much for them to bear.  	Even if some intelligent and lucky criminals escape the punishment by law, they cannot avoid the torture by their guilty conscience. On the one hand, they live in the constant fear of being catched [fm2,-] ; on the other hand, they condemn themselves for such a foolish act. These two combined makes them feel uneasy. They try to appear calm in public, but they know that there is no easy calmness in their minds. It's really an ordeal for them.  	Not only the criminals are punished [wd1,s-] their family [np3,s-] are also harmed. It breaks their hearts to see their beloved arrested. They are looked down upon and live in the shadow of the crime. They meet a lot of difficulties in daily life just because they are the relatives of a criminal.  	So, crime brings more harm than achievement, more sadness than joy, more loss than benefit. Crime really does not pay.  (t1-2)  	With the development of our society and economy. [sn2,s] More and more crimes are committed in our daily life. Crimes seem to be one of the direct results of civilization. The U.S, a highly developed country, has the highest criming [wd2,2-] rate in the world. The number of crimes in developing countries are [vp3,s-] also increasing. Most governments [np5,s-] try to diminish crimes either [wd5,s-] by punishing criminals. Some people think that criminals should be rehabilitated, not be punished. However, the effective way to reduce crimes turns out to be to combine the two ways together.  	Crime does great harm to our society. It theatens [fm1,-] the safety of our property [sn9,s-] our lives and prevents the development of the economy. But there are two kinds of criminals, real and unreal [wd4,s-] Real criminals are hostile to the society and they live on [wd3,2-4] stealing, robbing or smuggling. They hate laboring by themselves. When captured, they refuse to confess their crimes and even reaccomplish [fm1,-] crimes [cc3,1-] after they are set free. Therefore, to this kind of criminals, We [fm3,-] should punish them because they deserve it.  	However, unreal criminals usually commit crimes without knowing them. They are always kind, warm-hearted and responsible, but they kill others, rape others or steal something because they cannot control themselves. Although the results are almost the same as those caused by real criminals, they regret and acknowledge their crimes. Therefore, they should be rehabilitated.  	We should treat different criminals differently. Some criminals are well-educated. Some are still very young. If rehabilitated, the well-educated and the young can make contribution to the society. Since there are more and more juvenile delinquencies nowadays, the juvenile should be reeducated because they are the hope of the nation.  	To draw a conclusion, we should combine the two ways, punishing and rehabilitating in order to reduce crimes.  (t1-3)  	Crime has existed in human society for thousands of years. People are even startled at the rocketing rate of crimes in recent years. Some knowledgable [fm1,-] gentlemen begin to be doubtful about that [wd5,s-] whether our society is in the process of degeneration. So this issue is quite a complicated one. It would be an oversimplified statement to say that crime does not pay or vice versa before we trace the reasons of crimes.  	Crime shall have a new definition. Legally speaking, it refers [vp1,s-] that one inflicts [vp1,s-] physically, finacially [fm1,-] and psychologically on others. In my opinion, there are two kinds of crimes. The first is the result of the criminal's possessive instinct. The other kind is because [wd5,s-] that commiting [fm2,-] crimes has become the criminal's mannerism. Some criminals commit crimes because of their mental sickness. Sadism and kleptomania shall be catergorized [fm1,-] into the second kind. In the first respect, the victims would suffer from the crimes and the criminals would probably be caught and sentenced to imprisonment, otherwise the criminals would suffer from their guilt in the rest of their life. In the second respect, the victims also can't avoid their disasters. While the crimes would aggravate the criminal's mental sickness, which would lead to the break-down of the criminals [sn2,s-] So in these two respects, both victims and criminals can't benefit from crimes.  	As we are holding a negative point of view on the individual crimes, does the principle apply to the group crimes. [sn9,s-] In ancient China, rulers of different kingdoms launched countless wars to plunder neighboring kingdoms. People of that time lived in an [np7,-1] constant fear of wars. Every dynasty established [vp7,s-] at the expense of many innocente's [fm1,-] lives. To strenghten [fm1,-] their positions every ruler suppressed people's intelligence and creation. What they committed are great crimes [vp6,s-] On the other hand, autocracy led to the assimilation of many nationalities. In this sense, those inhuman rulers really contribute a lot to the unification of one country [vp6,d]  	So everything is two sided. Crime does not pay, but sometime crime does pay.  (t1-4)  	Sometimes if members of a society are dissatisfied with their social or financial condition or frustrated by certain emotional crisis, they will tend to seek solutions or let-out of their problems. When the pressure of the desire goes beyond their bearance [fm2,-] crimes are likely to be committed. They transgress the social agreement --- laws of a society, which serve to protect the interest of the majority [sn9,s-] to satisfy their unquenchable desires. Although some lucky or phemonenally [fm1,-] tricky ones can escape the punishment, geneally [fm1,-] the majority still have to pay for their outrageous behavoir [fm1,-] painfully, for prison or even penalty is waiting for them.  	Crime does not pay. Besides the danger of legal punishment, the accusation of his consience [fm1,-] and tortment [fm1,-] of his restless fear of punishment will suffer [cc3,-3] him and accompany him until the end of his life. He would lose the sense of pride of being a law-obeseving [fm1,-] citizen and could no longer enjoy the good feeling of standing in the light [wd7,s-] for life seems to him [vp5,s-] have turned into hiding darkness. He would avoid the public and any unsual [fm1,-] movement of the people around would always alter his deep-hidden uneasiness. Suspection [fm2,-] would forever replace the trust of friendship. He would even find no security at home, for he is not sure whether the door would be knocked opend [fm1,-] at any time, day or night, by several full-armed [fm2,-] policemen with loaded guns pointing towards him.  	The fear of the ruin of his future and fame and family would definately [fm1,-] exceed the permanent pleasure he got from the crime. He would find that the hope of improving his life by taking the risk has turned out to be a total failure. He would long for the peaceful life and the comfort of his conscience so much, that he can [vp8,s-] only have two choices, [sn9,s-] to go to the police station or to commit suicide, which actually have been practiced very often by a lot of emotionally-collapsed criminals. Otherwise he would let his hatred and uncontrollable desires flood out to break the law again and again [wd7,s-] more and more seriously, until he ends up his life by a bullet.  	If not controlled well, desires can totally destroy a person. Please think it over. What can be compared with a happy family, friendship, love from others and for others, the pride of being a [np7,-1] upright man? Although life is for the most part plain and lack of [wd3,2-] excitement, crimes really does not pay.  (t1-5)  	One of the most serious problems of our society is the speeding rate of crimes. Why is that? In order to prevent more and more people from commiting [fm2,-] a crime, I think it neccessary [fm1,-] to convince them that crime does not pay. Hereby I will take robbery as an example to illustrate this.  	Generally speaking, despite the different forms of crimes, the reason for a person to commit a crime is to meet his anxiety. Thus the only advantage of robbery for a robber is to some degree to accumulate fortures [fm1,-] in a short time without putting [vp1,-4] into too much labor, time, energy and money. But compared with the disadvantages commiting [fm2,-] a crime brings about, the advantage is not worthy [aaj1,2-1] mentioning. We can see the disadvantages in the following.  	The first disadvantage of commiting [fm2,-] a crime is that the robber himself has to burden [vp1,2-3] [cc3,1-3] great mental pressure because he has broken the law. He will always worry about being caught and the following penalties. He will become more suspicious and feels guilty and can't lead a normal life. Sooner or later, he will collapse.  	The second one is concered [fm1,-] with the penalties when he was [vp6,s-] exposed. According to Chinese Criminal Law, a robber will be heavily fined or be sentenced to 2-3 years imprisonment. And if the victime [fm1,-] is injured or dead when fighting against the robber, the robber will be more severely punished or even be deprived of life. Speaking from this point, Crime really does not pay.  	The last one is the most effective to illustrate the point, which is very pratical [fm1,-] and well conveyed in our China. When a person is found guilty, all his relatives will be looked down upon by the society. But the situation will be more miserable for the criminal himself after he is set free. He will find it difficult to make a living or in other words to begin a new, normal life. In fact, he will be totally be [wddd6,s-] discarded by the society. Actually other forms of crime is like-wise.  	Basing [vp1,-3] on the information [wd1,2-2] above mentioned, we can easily understand that Crime does not pay.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH SJD> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (t1-1)  	Life is a long run, a moment [wd2,1-1] spark between two externals: before birth and after death. One will meet with both dilemma and smooth [wd2,4-] One should enjoy both laughter and tears. Time and tide wait for no man. It is wise to fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds worth of distance run, using your mind, strength...... [sn9,s] But never Crime. [sn2,s] Crime does not pay.  	Firstly, crime is within social jurisdiction. In a democratic socity [fm1,-] equipped with legal system, it is not crime that pay [vp3,5-] you, but you pay for the crime by years in prison or even your life. Few people dare to take this big risk, for there is no never-lose-general in this world. One slip you will run into the canyon and the moment [wd2,1-1] slip is for ever [sn8,s]  	Sencondly [fm1,-] even if the crime is kept as a secret, and you've escaped from punishment crime will not pay you, either. The time you do crime [cc3,1-] and go through the shortcut [wd7,s-] you have set up blocks [cc3,2-] on your way in future unconsciously. In the coming days, you must pay for what you have done, twice as much as what you have gained. A good turn deserves another. If superstitions happen to be true, criminals will be thrown into hell. If you don't believe in god [fm3,-] you'll also find that god [fm3,-] is at work everytime [fm2,-] everywhere. For example, a student [wd4,s-] got [wd4,s-] scholarship by cheating may be get [vp9,2-] fired by his future boss for being uncapable [fm2,-] of his job. For another example, he or she makes boy friends or girl friends at the same time, he or she will be likely to lose all when they know that they have been cheated. For still another example, how many crimals [fm1,-] could survive in human history? They punished [vp7,s-] by people after one night's glory. Though, [sn9,s-] I don't believe in God, I feel there is [wd5,3-3] must be something that conquers all.   Finally, I want to end with a lovely story, which is known to children. One day, a lovely pig called Pa Jie was eatting [fm2,-] watermelon with great pleasure, but he threw away the waste everywhere with no regards to the public hygiene, then he stepped on the watermelon and fell down on the road. The watermelon stuck to his feet magically until the pig realized that: crime doesn't pay. So, I think that sometime we can quit doing foolish things such as crime, anyway human beings should be more clever [aj3,1-1] than that pig.  (t1-2)  	"Crime does not pay." I don't think these words are worth saying to those criminals without conscience, because they don't belong to this civilized world. How can we call a creature without soul a human being? Only to those who have the hope of going back to the track and those would be [fm2,-] criminals can we say. Don't commit crime, [sn9,s] crime does not pay.   None of the criminals lives a happy life, I believe, though some of them try to use seemingly luxurious life [cc3,4-] to conceal this fact. Didn't they know that their behaviour is [vp6,s-] surely followed by this result?   First, let us look at the most common situation. Most of the criminals are avoidably [wd3,s-] arrested and sentenced to years of imprisonment. They are forced to live in jail where high wall [np6,2-] and intricate wire are rounded. Many guards keep a close watch on them all the time. They lose freedom, which is the most treasurous [fm2,-] right each ordinary person shall possess. And hard labour becomes their daily life. When they are allowed to step out of the prison, they will find in surprise that the world has totally changed while they dedicate nothing. Human being's [np6,1-] life span is faily [fm1,-] short, how can they waste intelligence, energy and the most cherished time to moralize their follies when they would have many important things to do?   Not all the criminals are put into prison to live a miserable life. The second category is those tricky and lucky ones who even live more comfortably and luxuriously than the ordinary. They did various disgraceful things and a large amount of money flow [vp6,s-] into their account. They can afford several summer houses. [wd4,s-] Private helicopter is just a piece of cake. Apparently, their decent life is worth envying. But what about their mind, their spirit? Is their spirit as free and relax [wd2,5-3] as their body?   Crime does not pay. Pain in flesh is not the point. It is the spiritual burden that plays the key role. All the crimes are against law or ethics. Since they are not permitted by the society, every criminal who has conscience will feel guilty and shameful about his fit of madness. Accordingly, they know blood for blood is a natural law. They blackmailed [vp1,1-1] smuggled, robbed, assassinated [vp1,1-1] What they had done leads [vp6,s-] to tasteless meal [np6,1-1] and white night. They dare not face their relatives and friends, even the walkers in the streets. They are sensitive to each slight sound. They dare not go out alone, especially in the dark, fearing that the victims would take revenge. At last, some of them lose health [cc3,1-] and die early, some commit suicide. I remember watching a movie. It is something like a young man got a habit of washing hands every few minutes. When the psycological [wf1,-] doctor told him that it was a victim's blood in his hand that he wanted to clean, he killed himself.   Spiritual punishment is much more cruel [aj3,1-] and efficient than that of body. So, behave yourself, for the [wd5,1-2] Heaven's vengeance is slow but sure.  (t1-3)   Do you know why criminals are much less [wd3,3-] [cc4,3-] than people who haven't committed crimes. This seems like a very easy question, each person can give a different answer. But few can give the key reason. In fact, people control themselves not to commit [vp1,5-] crimes just because of a belief --- "Crime does not pay" deeply [wd2,4-3] in their minds that impell [fm1,-] them far away from crimes.   Crime does not pay. These four ordinary words act [cc2,-4] a very important role in preventing crimes from being rampant. It works so naturally that no one had noticed [vp6,s-] why he stops himself when he wants to commit a crime. Everyone must have such an experience: You found one's very precious watch or ring on his desk and you had the chance to get it easily [sn9,s-] then you had an impose [wd3,s-] to steal it. But you didn't do it because before you did you would compare what you could get from the crime with the result that your crime was found and you would find that crime does not pay.   There are two main facts that cause people [vp1,1-1] think that crime does not pay. One is man's law and punishment structure. They can prevent people from committing crimes, [sn9,s-] he must think of the cruel punishment he will suffer from. The other is people's intuitive knowledge. People got [vp6,d] it in two ways. Part of it is acquired when born, part of it acquired through social instruction.   Nowadays crime tends to be more and more rampant, so it's more and more necessary to make more people realize that crime does not pay. Today's world is a highly civilized world, so we can't use many cruel penalties to punish criminals and attempt to put crimes down by punishment. Whereas God created [vp1,-3] the mind free [sn2,s-] ; that [wd5,s-] all attempts to influence [vp1,3-2] by punishments or burthens, or by civil [cc4,-1] incapacitations [np5,-] tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness. Since we are civilized people we should be able to instruct everybody not to commit crimes deeply [cc6,-3] in his mind [wd7,s-]   Punishment and instruction are two different ways of making people not commit crimes. The former makes people be afraid of committing crimes, but the latter is for the purpose of arousing people's intuitive knowledge. Only when one thinks that it does not pay to commit a crime at the cost of losing his intuitive knowledge, crimes [wd1,s-] can be eliminated effectively.   It is just like treating a patient who has a fever. A quack will put his attention to the fever itself and give the patients [np3,s-] some antipyretic, but a qualified doctor will manage to find the reason [cc3,-1] causing the fever and suit the medicine to the illness. If a government only use [vp3,2-1] punishment to deal with crime, it's just like the quack, it will never deal well with crime.   So today we speak of "Crime does not pay", this does not only mean the sentence itself. Our purpose is to give everybody a belief that only making people realise that crime is terrible, not divine and crime does not pay is the right way to deal with crime.  (t1-4)   To a person who lives in a metropolis, crime is no longer a chance occurrance [fm2,-] but perhaps a frequent disturbance to his daily life. Actually, we are often scared by some savage and cruel crimes. However, are crimes a [np3,2-1] nightmare to those who commit them as well as to the innocent?   My answer is "yes". A culprit may have many motives to violate the law, such as money, power, social position etc [wd5,6-] which every human being craves for and has a right to attain. When we strive to achieve these, we should never harm others to benefit ourselves. There is a maxim that says "Live and let live." The criminals break the golden rule, so they are doomed to receive their retribution both physical [wd2,s-] and spiritual [wd2,s-]   One of their punishment [np6,3-] is loss of freedom [sn9,s-] To be confined in a room, a convict leads a kind of life which is totally decided by others. He is to be told what to do and when to do something. In prison, his body is imprisoned and his mind is restricted. He has no delight of life, no time for hobbies, little affection from friends and relatives. His freedom is deprived [vp1,3-] which is a just punishment to what he has done. Loss of bodily enjoyment may be tolerable, but loss of freedom is intolerable. What a criminal got from his crime can never compensate the mental agony he suffers in Jail [fm3,1-] Imagine a convict in a prison, what encircle him are bars and walls and the atmosphere is depressing, but there are [vp3,1-2] [wd4,1-2] blue sky, green trees and red roses outside. All these beautiful things and happy life are right before [wd4,1-1] eyes but unaccessible [fm2,-] This is the most bitter experience in the world and this is a criminal's punishment to his crime.   Even when a convict is realeased [fm1,-] his mental agony would not disappear since his inferiority is decided. He could never change the fact that he has once been a criminal and was banished from society. Perhaps, he has transformed himself, but it is really difficult for a person set free from jail to be accepted by society again. People would adopt an attitude of sceptism [fm1,-] and coldness towards him. Years of life without freedom and delight and years of life surrounded by distrust and frigid manner. What a criminal gets from his crime is temporary, but he should use a very long time to make up his crime [cc3,3-] if he wants [vp1,-5] be a respectable person again. Sometimes, the effort need [vp3,2-2] the whole rest of his life.   There is no denying the fact that some criminals are at large. They may escape from the net of justice, but they could not escape mental agony. Everyday [fm2,-s-] they dread that they maybe [fm2,-s-] arrested or punished the next minute. We all know Macbeth and his wife's panic-stricken minds. They were driven [vp1,2-3] to mad and had no peace after they killed the king. Lady Macbeth even died of the terror of the crime she had committed.   There is a Chinese saying "Evil will be recompensed with evil". If a criminal didn't be [vp9,1-1] imprisoned, he would still have his judgement. He would be tormented by his conscience, dreaded [vp7,s-] with the enormity of his crime. No matter what kind of life he would lead later, the criminal lives in terror. He must pay for his crime.  (t1-5)   In modern society it [wd7,-s-] is more violent and more lawless than in the past years. Such as [pp1,s-] burglar [wd3,2-3] kidnapping, murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault happen everyday [fm2,s-] everywhere. For crime's widespread, you may think that crime does pay. Otherwise, why so many people are on this boat?   Through crime, one will have other's properties. Does the crime pay? Since then, the police, the courts, the trial, the sentence and the jail are waiting for him. He cannot live open and above board with the others' properties. Some day, the place [wd3,d] will knock at his door. Then he lost [vp6,s-] what he has owned [sn9,s-] both the property and the freedom. Seldom can he get off. But in his mind he is still afraid to be tried. The bitter sense perception [wd7,s-] will be with him for ever. He is waiting his arrest in his imagination or in his dream. Crime does not pay. [wd4,s-] One committed [vp6,d] crime [np6,2-] as [fm1,-] the same time he lost something. The murder [wd3,s-] is afraid of his victim to haunt [vp1,s1] One may kill a person indirectly, [sn9,s-] in this way, he is also afraid of reprimand. Have you read "The lovely lady" written by D.H.Lawrence? The lovely lady loved her sons deeply, she didn't want [vp1,-4] share her sons with her [wd7,s-] When her old [wd3,d] son, Harry, fell in love, she was afraid that her son's girlfriend will leave no room to her in her son's heart. She forced Harry to be away with his lover. Harry desperated [wd2,-] and then died. She is response [wd2,s-] to her son's death. It is a consequential crime [cc4,1-] The girl didn't win. Neither did she. Her indirect murder [cc4,1-3] to her son and the lost of son formed the shadow in her mind. Her niece's imitation of Harry's voice is the base of her madness and death. This consequential crime doesn't pay her anything. One of the crime movitation [fm1,-] is to be a hero. It is laughable that the person who "discovers" a fire is the person who start [vp3,s-] it. A private guard organization demoted a sergant [fm1,-] for reducing the force. Shortly after that, a fire was discoverd [fm2,-] by the sergean [fm1,-] And his quick action was praised. But investigator [np6,s-] had found [vp6,s-] out that the sergean [fm1,-] is the person who set the fire. Then he lost his vanity, his heroism, went into a mental insitution [fm1,-] and then in [wd3,s-] prison.   People commited [fm2,-] crime for something they don't own or something they don't want to own such as the old parents and young babies on [wd3,s-] something which is lost. They go against the objective law, so they fail. The crime does not pay.   There is also a kind of queer crime, environment pollotion [fm1,-] What we [wd1,s-] have done to the environment which our ancients lived on[pp1,-]? Rivers are found to be black and smelly. Valuable lands are discreasing [fm1,-] every year. More foggy mornings are with us. In [pp2,-1] present, pollution is a very serious problem. It spoils our lives. It makes water unsuitable to drink, make [vp3,s-] air hard to breathe and even result [vp3,s-] in serious human illness and death. It is a crime. Human beings require resources [cc3,1-]from the environment to survive. When everything is polluted, what will [vp9,1-1] left to our [wd4,s-] generations? We suffer from the pollution. The water pollutant, the air pollutant and the soil pollutant are our enemy. Man makes his enemy. Does this crime pay?   Everything has his [wd3,2-2] own order, don't go against them. You will get no pay. So [wd3,d] does crime.  (t1-6)   Robbing a bank with masks on faces and gun [np6,-2] in hands, picking someone else's pockets on the bus, murdering someone with very carefully arranged plans, selling illegal drugs for the attractive amount of money, nowday [fm1,-] [sn2,s-] This kind of crimes exist every where [fm2,1-] It has become a particularly troublesome problem to the local residents. The criminals dare to do that under the pressure of law because they think if they can escape from the punishment [sn9,s-] of the law, they will fulfill their goals [cc3,2-] which they will never success [wd2,2-] in legal ways. Obviously they think crime does pay! But my opinion on this problem is that crime will never pay in spite of whether it is successful or not.  Human being [np6,1-1] is a kind of thinking animal. They do everything for some certain purposes. So does crime. The animals [wd3,s-] do everything against law in order to satisfy their desires [cc3,2-] on something such as money, power and so on. But at the same time, they are losing something more important than [wd4,s-] they have got by illegal ways. That is the joy of their future life. So I think crime does not pay.   Commonly the aftermaths of crime can be divided into 3 groups, [sn9,s-] The first one is that after the crime is done [cc3,3-] it is found out by the governments [np5,s-] So the criminals will soon be arrested, and sentenced. These unlucky guys have to face their hard time. They are forced to be in jail for quite a long time, suffering from the loneliness inside the high wall and the loss of freedom, which is the basic right for a person. Some more unlucky guys even will end their life. Their freedom even life leaves them, let alone the joy of their future life.   The second condition is that although the crime is found out, the criminal avoid [vp3,s-] being arrested and hide [vp3,s-] in somewhere else. Because of what he has done, he has to abandon his job, his family, the land he has lived [wd4,s-] for a quite [wd1,2-2] long time. It also means that he has abandoned his life as a normal person. Maybe he will go to a place which he never knew before, worrying [vp1,-s-] about some day the worst thing will occur. So he has to do everything very carefully, trying his best not to expose himself in public. Maybe this kind of life is even worse than that in prison because after all, the person in jail still has the hope to go out of the prison and become a new person and start the common life again on condition that he does not continue doing his old job as a criminal.   Thirdly, the condition is that some expert or professional criminals who has [vp3,s-] the ability to escape from the punishment by very wickied [fm1,-] ways also suffer from what they have done. This kind of persons never have [vp3,4-] the hope of tomorrow. They live just because their bodys [fm2,-] and organs are alive. They never think of tomorrow because they can't predict what is going to happen. They are suffering so much mentally. Maybe they will wake [vp7,s-] up by the nightmare. Their nerves are always tense. Their life also have [vp3,s-] no joy. Their conscience also will be blamed. So maybe they looks [vp3,1-] very successful, they also lose the joy of life.  There's a famous Chinese saying which says, "In the end a wicked person will suffer from his crime, a kind person will get reward from his kind deed." It is so obvious that crime does not pay.  (t1-7)   H. Johnson was lying on the field, with blood flowing down across the face. A bullet had gone through his head from one side to the other. Johnson's left hand was grasping a bag firmly, which was partly opened, with some bundles of dollars fallen out. Beside his right hand, there was a gun, which was also smeared with blood. "It doesn't pay!" An old man signed in the crowd, which was around the circle set by the policemen. Yes [wd3,s-] it doesn't pay! Johnson was dead, as [pp2,-] the age of 21. He lost his life, getting nothing except having killed two men in the bank. Crime was dangerous and evil. People will hate it for ever, and it will do [vp9,1-2] not pay whenever.   Most of the criminals had received punishment which they should be given. They lost their lives [np5,s-] or the freedom, but getting [vp4,s-] nothing they wanted. They died young or were set free when they were old. They lost a lot, besides the life, the freedom and youth. Most people became poor when they got out from prison. They had lost their fame and the status, which they ever had some years ago. Most of [wd5,1-1] people hated them. No one world believe in them. They became alone. Some of them even couldn't be accepted by their own family. A few of them committed suicide. They couldn't be understood by the people around him [pr3,s-] They felt that they had been abandoned by the society. All of [wd4,1-1] above were resulted in by the crime itself. So if having been caught, the criminal will get nothing, but to [vp4,s-] lose a lot.   Of course, there were a few criminals who hadn't been discovered or had escaped being punished. How about them? I said what they had lost was much more than what they had got. Every one of them were [vp3,4-] frightened day and night, worrying about being discoved [fm1,-] and being punished. They were afraid of losing what they had got, losing their personal right, and losing their fame and status. They tried to hide the crime, but they couldn't abate it in their mind. They blamed themselves whenever they remembered it. Some murderers felt the victim's shadow were [vp3,2-] following them whenever. They couldn't stand it. Finally most of them became ill or crazy. No one could escape being punished, indeed. Even if you had not been punished by the law, you would be punished by the conscience. After the crime, you would become a different person. You would feel guilty and you would lose happiness at most times [pp2,2-] in life. You lost a lot, but got little, including the evil.   There was no reason for you to do [cc3,-1] crime, even if you were anxiously [wd2,s-] to get something or to do something. Because when you got it you lost more [sn2,s-] whether the crime was discovered or not. So the person who was [vp6,s-] innocent, please not be fool [wd2,s-] to do [cc3,-2] any crime. It dose not pay!  (t1-8)   What is the commonest phenomenon in the human societies? The answer is ridiculous and also deplorable --- crime. No matter in the history, nowadays or in the future; no matter in the West or the East, in the capitalist society or the socialist society, crime always keeps its vigorous life. Is this on earth [wd1,1-] a sign of human civilisation or the decay of humanity? Maybe nobody can give a perfect answer. But for the question --- "Does crime pay since so many crimes happen?" the answer is clear --- "No".  Jurisdiction system's establishment gives the best proof --- Law is impartial and eventually criminals being caught would be punished severely. They are brought to trial and declared guilty in accordiance [fm1,-] with Law [pp1,s-] What is waiting for them is the very long prison [wd3,s-] --- the loss of freedom, the limit of rights and the separation from the outside world [sn9,s-] including their families. The feeling of loneliness and desperation haunts them and torments them. And the abominable murders [wd2,-] also get what they deserve --- sentenced to death. Is it worthwhile to exchange a life's [cc1,1-1] freedom and happiness with the momentary's [fm1,-] freedom or stimulus? It is certain to be not [wd7,2-] Each person should take the responsibility for himself or herself. Since he takes the risk to break the law, then he has to accept the unpaying result and has no other choice.  Beyond the Law's penalty, there is another powerful and effective force to punish the criminals. That is people's moral concept --- which is right and just, which is wrong and evil. Undoubtedly, crimes pertain to the last category. So what confront the criminals must be criticism, indifference and alienation. Their families are humiliate [vp9,3-1] and their wives and children are censured. This loneliness and uneasiness is a kind of torment to the spirit. It can be more afflicting [wd7,s-] than the torment to the flesh.   Even the jurisdiction system always declares --- "No criminal can escape the punishment of Law", in fact, so many suits are still unsolved and so many criminals go scot-free. Then are they really be [wd5,2-3] free and easy? My answer is "No. They just escape the penalty of the Law, but they could never escape the punishment of their conscience." Everday [fm1,-] they have to be on tenterhooks, afraid something is on the point of happening to them. The uneasiness torments their tense [cc32-] and makes it [wd7,s-] strained very tightly. They suspect everything and trust in nobody except themselves. In their dreams, the nightmares always haunt them. The [wd3,-s-] murder [wd3,s-] may dream that the murdered haul [vp3,2-4] him to the hell and the devil cut [vp3,s-] him into pieces. At last they [pr3,s-] always wake [vp3,s-] up frightenedly [fm2,-] with [wd4,1-2] whole-body's sweat. This torment would accompany them to the day of being arrested or to the end of the life. An inevitable unpaying [fm1,-] result!   Crime does really [ad1,s-] not pay --- this is already very clear. What should we do to prevent or reduce the happening of crimes? The perfection of legal system? The fairness of the Law [fm3,-]? Maybe they are [wd7,d] But I think the most important is education of legal [wd2,1-] The ultimate aim of punishment should not just punish [cc2,s-] the criminals, but help them awaken and turn over a new leaf, [sn9,s-] this is [wd4,-3] real meaning of "Crime does not pay".  (t1-9)  Crime, as a representative of evil, is abhored [fm1,-] by every person who has a sense of justice. Nowadays, in our civilized societies, most people regard crime as stupid behavior since criminals never get more than what they suffer.   People who commit crimes have various reasons. Some of them are eager to get rich, so they embezzle public money; some minor offenders just want to show their braveries [np5,-] so they fight and hurt each other. Misunderstanding between people also leads to crime easily. Usually, we give [cc3,-2] great sympathy to those criminals who have every reason to support their behaviors [np5,-] but laws never, so none of their reasons can cancel out their guilts [np5,-]   In the late Qing Dynasty, there was a very poor scholar whose name is [vp6,s-] Kong Yi Ji. He once stole some books from a country gentleman's house, because he had no money to buy books himself. His behavior caused a sound beating, but he still said, " [wd4,s-] We scholar [np3,1-] steals [vp3,2-1] books is not real theft." Kong was worthy of being sympathetic [wd3,d] but he could not escape from punishment [cc3,2-]   Several hundred years ago, the punishments to the riminals were very severe. But now, in most countries, the purpose of criminal penalty is to transform offenders into new people. Even so, most prisoners feel depressed during their prison terms. Long imprisonments [np5,-] make them hopeless and annoyed, and monotonous prison lives make them crazy. Only after this procedure, they realize that lives they did [wd3,s-] not satisfied with before are actually the most valuable treasures. There is another factor which leads to prisoners' depression, that is the deprivation of freedom. Unlike other factors, losing freedom just means losing [wd4,1-3] basic right of human-beings, so most people cannot bear such pressures. Today, more and more people agree that crime harms society as well as [wd4,-2] criminal himself.   On the other hand, every person, including [wd4,s-] criminal, has conscience in his inner soul [cc4,1-] Many criminals suffer reprimands from their hearts, but it is too late for them to repent. [wd4,s-] More terribe [fm1,-] experience for a criminal is loneliness. Even after a prisoner is released, he has to prepare to face the fact that he will probably become lonely, since no one wants to make friends with a criminal, people even refuse to help him.   There is a widely spreaded [fm2,-] common saying in China, that is "Evil will be recompensed with evil!" Hitler's tragic ending is just a good example. He fell into the dark hell from the pinnacle of his boundless power. Finally, he commited [fm2,-] suicide after his empire's failure became [vp1,-2] into certainty. It is impossible for this criminal to escape from the punishment of justice. In fact, no matter [wd4,2-4] Hitler or a poor tramp, person [np6,s-] who commit crimes must get a bitter back [wd7,s-] he must be dealt with according to laws and public opinions, since his immoral offense is aggression upon others' rights. So what he gets from crime is always much less than what he suffers, he will finally reap what he has sown. Crime does not pay. This is a truth.  (t1-10)   Today's China is advancing in economy and technology at a surprising speed, but some problems occure [fm1,-] at the same time. Among them are inflation and competitive system [np6,2-1] which lead to some people's loss of job [np6,1-] For those out of job [np6,1-] life is poor [cc4,2-] and hard in comparision [fm1,-] with those becoming rich in reforms. Gradually there comes out a saying, "Crime is better than starvation." I am strongly against this view, because crime does not pay.   If a person fails in committing crime, surely he will be brought to trial. The prison life, which is bitter and strict for everyone, will be the only payment for the crime. He will have to suffer pain which he has never experienced before. He will have to take hard labour not for benefit but for [wd3,s-] punishment. He will receive instruction which will make him regret for what he has done. He will be restricted in communication with his family and friends. Even when he steps out of the prison, he will suffer the pain of crime, because the files will accompany him wherever he goes. He still cannot live freely. His family will also live in pain, because they may be looked down [vp2,1-2] or suspected. Those are what one will face if he chooses crime and fails it. Crime will not pay him what he has expected, except endless pain and loneliness.   If one does succeed in crime and escape the punishment, what will happen? Maybe he will live in luxury which he is always longing for, maybe he will be respected for his wealth, but will he be really happy then? People live for happiness. To achive [fm1,-] that, one can take money, fame, relief, love as means. If he chooses crime to get what he wants, he will have [wd4,-2] guilty sense since he knows he has violated the law. The moral [np6,s-] and conscious [wd2,3-2] are planted in anyone's nature, and will punish him mercilessly even if he can escape the punishment from laws. From then on he will have to suffer self-criticism, guilty sense and fear of being exposed. Then how can he live happily with so much moral burden? Besides that, the punishment will also fall on his family, his colleagues, his friends and the other loved one, because they all care him and be [vp4,5-] affluenced [fm1,-] by his crime and pain. So a winner in crime will also be confronted with a gloomy future. Crime does not pay a successful criminal either.   Now let us come to the saying at the begining [fm2,-] of the essay. Is crime really better than starvation? The answer is absolutely negative. Crime will not pay and starvation will not happen. Because if one has the courage to commit crime and the wisdom and ability to accomplish [cc3,-2] the crime, surely he can live on with the courage, wisdom and ability by legal means. When one is going to commit suicide, he is always given a saying, "If you have the courage to face death, why can't you have the same courage for life?" We can change it a bit, "If you have the courage to commit a crime, why don't you have the same courage to work legally?"   Now, China's reform has provided many opportunities for those [wd4,s-] capable and industrious. No one will stave [fm1,-] if he works hard, so don't think about crime any more. One can surely find a better way to improve his life than crime[wd2,-], while the latter just pays nothing.  (t1-11)   Varying motives impel [vp1,-4] innocent people degrading into criminals: greedy [wd2,s-] for money, covetous [wd2,s-] for [wd3,1-] fame, venting momentary hatred, or just for political reasons [wd7,s-] We're averse to those ugly souls and atrocities they committed. But sometimes our human whims inspire us to think another way. Only a small portion of crimes were exposed and even a smaller number of criminals delivered justice [wd7,s-] Think what luck has brought [vp7,s-] to those evils [wd3,s-] at large --- some have cases of money at their disposal; some indulge in privileges that will take us life-time to achieve, some hug themselves over their unjust but effective persecution of their opponents...   Does it mean that the odds are so small compared with the looming profits that crimes are worth trying? The answer is absolutely negative. Most of us only get a superficial view of this flower-decorated trap. However, if we shift our focus onto the psychological aspect of this paradox, it is another story. Don't naively deem that criminals are stereotyped shameless people. Actually they are no less warm-hearted than you and me. They can never be independent of their hearts or shame unless they are enchanted by some supernaturally evil agent. In the course of time, criminals are bound to suffer psychologically. When squandering robbed money, a criminal is nervous because of the apprehension that he may be recognized anywhere and at any time. In another case, when a TV program reported the fatalities caused by a brand of fake wine, featuring a crippled young father who was victimized by a bottle of this evil wine, while his three children weeping around him [sn2,s-] The hiden [fm1,-] criminal's nerve collapsed. His conscience forced its way out. He shuddered at the thought of giving himself up to the police for the fear of everyone's spit and contempt. Each word from the program gnawed his heart. After two days' psychological torment he committed suicide after jotting down his repentant words.   You may argue that not all criminals were conscience-stricken. Yes, some villains can do [cc3,-3] the feat of burying their conscience into the very deep [pp2,3-] They didn't scruple to lead a comfortable and unrepentant life after the crimes. However, as they grow old, they are inclined to weigh [vp1,-s-] less and less about material comfort like most of the ageing [wd3,1-1] people, substituted [wd7,s-] by life-retrospection. Their conscious dictates will reprimand [cc2,4-] them as heartless savages, followed by the freeing of their long-fettered shame and remorse. Most of them will grow regretful to the extent of despising their egoes [wd2,-] A few of them can even commit suicide for the fear of further psychological obsession. A recent example is the suicide of the American pilot who dropped an A-bomb onto the Japanese City of Hiroshima in 1945, probably motivated by the increasing global consensus of peace and condemnation of the tragedy.   Human beings are gregarious creatures. Laws are enacted on behalf of the majority. Those who violate them will incur more sufferings than the profits temporarily extracted, not necessarily physically, but always psychologically. That's the tragic point of degrading into a criminal [sn8,s]   

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH B2W> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (b2w-t1-1)  As the proverb says, "Good will be rewarded with good, and evil with evil." Everyone shall be responsible for what he does, except the mental disorders [cc1,s-] [wd4,s-] Law, is rule [np6,2-2] made by authority for the regulation of community [np6,2-3] or society or correct conduct in life. Everyone who breaks the law must be punished. Punishment, in accordance with the law, of a small number of law-breakers is intended on the one hand to turn them into law-abiding and self-supporting workers so that they will refrain from doing harm to [wd4,2-2] society and, on the other hand, is aimed at educating a greater number of potenial [fm1,-] offenders so that they eill [fm1,-] be aware of the inviolability of law and refrain from rashly breaking the law. The aim is to protect the basic rights, freedoms, and other legal rights and interests of the whole people [fm1,-] in accordance with law, protect public property and citizens' lawfully-owned private property, and maintain social order.  But, today some poeple [fm1,-] think that the prison system is outdated, they believe no citilized [fm1,-] society punish [vp3,3-] its crimical [fm1,-] In my opinion, they are fool [np3,2-] They are too kind to all of the people, including the evils [wd7,s-] When I was still a child, I have heard [vp6,s-] too many story [np3,2-] about these kind men who recieved [fm1,-] instead of kind reward, but great harm [wd1,s-] I wonder if you have heard the story of "SNAKE AND PEASANT". It goes like this: In a chilly winter, a kind peasant passed by a field when he found a snake. It was so cold that the snake was freezed [fm2,-] like a stick. The peason [fm1,-] paid a lot of sympathy to it. He picked it up and warmed it with his own body by hiding it in his clothes. But, as soon as the snake awaked, it bitted [fm2,-] the peasant and he died soon. When he was dying, the peasant told his familly [fm1,-] "The snake is a bad one, I should not have sympathized." The peasant was too foolish to help the snake. But, he was aware of his error at the last minutes [np3,2-] though it was too late. While today, there are still many "foolish peasant [np3,2-] ", they are not aware of what will be the result of what they are doing, yet. Must they know that until the moment they are facing the danger [wd7,s-] ? Couldn't they have a lesson from the story?  Another opinion of some poeple [fm1,-] is: money has more power than any other [wd4,s-] With money, they do everything the [fm1,-] want. The law, in their opinion, is only a paper --- without any power. They do the evils, then they can ask a skillful lawer [fm1,-] to defend them; they can ask a person to go to the jail in the place of them; they even can give the judger [fm2,-] a lot of money to let them [cc3,1-1] avoid the punishment. Why? Because they have a great deal of money, and because there are so many "kind people [fm1,-] " who also love money so much more than any other things. We know, [sn9,s-] money can buy [cc2,2-] many things, but not everything. Because we know too, "In front of law, equal [sn8,s-]"  All citizens are equal in regard to the applicability of law. In accordance with the law, each citizen's legal rights and interests shall be protected, and any citizen's offenses agaist the law and his criminal activities shall be looked into. And the procuratorate [fm1,-] and the court shall independently exercise their respective procuratorial [fm2,-] and judicial authority. They shall only obey the law and not be interfered with by any administrative organ, social organization or person. In one word, the law is sacred and invoilable [fm1,-] crime does not pay. (b2w-t1-2)  I partly agree to this subject. The reason is that everything has two sides, which indicates that we should analyze a thing from two aspects. From different angles, you will get different answers. Here the word "angle" means the [wd5,1-4] "the point of view" which consists [vp1,1-3] the following fields: different religion points [cc1,1-] different social systems, different ideological fields and etc..  Connecting the subject with Buddism [fm1,-] it is so-called "Karma", which expresses [vp1,-4] that "Sin retributed [fm2,-] by sin", and was mainly used to restrain the actions of religional [fm1,-] followers. This is benificial [fm1,-] for social stability and peace at [pp2,-2] a certain extent.  The viewpiont [fm1,-] "Crime does not pay" also find [vp3,s-] its position in natural laws. For instance, the human pollutes the air and destroys environment, and the human is retributed [fm2,-] by acid rain and flood [np6,4-] This truth can be commonly accepted.  The above two respects are suitable to this point from nature and religion. But placing it in ideological fields, [sn3,s-] this point can not be firm, because you can't find some prooves [fm1,-] to prove it. Can you say a spy [wd4,s-] surely be panalized [fm1,-] ? Certainly not. A spy prys [fm2,-] for information from a country, so the country suffers some heavy losses [np5,s-] It is a crime to the country, but it's a contribution to his own country.  It's a crime to you, but it's not to another person. In this case, how we can comprehend the word "crime" correctly [wd1,s-] ? First, we must see the essence through the phenomena, and understand its internal meaning. We should judge the crime and kindness according to a certain standard. The standard is linked with the way of thinking, various social system [np3,2-] self-cultivation and moral concepts. We can't measure the crime and kindness from a single side.  Secondly, at a certain degree, the crime is not not [wd6,1-] only a crime, but also it can become a good thing. In our country, the [wd5,s-] capitalism is considered a crime, and the wish to change a social [cc4,1-1] country into a capitalist country is an unforgiven [fm2,-] guilty. However they neglect [vp1,-s-] that capital [cc1,-1] system can also benefit the people. It also can supply a good envionment [fm1,-] for ecnomic [fm1,-] development. History shows that the countries adapting [wd3,s-] capitalism [wd2,-1] system [np6,2-] have got a very rapid ecnomic [fm1,-] development in a short time. Ecnomic [fm1,-] development and the improvement [fm1,-] of people's living level can change their viewpoints about crime and kindness. I also can represent another example. In World [wd4,1-1] Two, Japan's invision [fm1,-] to other countries was retributed [fm2,-] by a serious damage in all aspects. But Japanese rebuilt their country on the ruins of the war. Giving up the war and invision [fm1,-] the Japanese people devote themselves to the ecnomic [fm1,-] construction and become the most advanced country [cc1,s-] presently. Can we say Japan was retributed [fm2,-] by sin?  In a word, we should judge a thing from different sides. We also should deal with the world with the viewpoint of development. Only so [sn2,-] can we draw a right conclusion. 

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GW> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (t2-1)  	Nowadays some people claim that the present prison system is outdated. They assert that in our civilized society we need to rehabilitate the criminals rather than punish them by putting them in prison. However, this idea is rather groundless and ridiculous. If it is put into practice. [sn2,s-] our society will surely become a vicious one in which everyone commits crime to his heart's content without being afraid of receiving any punishment. There will be no law, no order, no prospering [wd3,5-] and no civilized society.  	We all know that the prison system has long been an effective way of dealing with those hideous social worms and it is also a deterrent force towards any potential evil germ. According to psychological analysis, a person is born with an internal evil impulse which might under certain circumstances force him to commit things that are harmful to his surroundings. It is our prison system that make [vp3,6-] people realize the consequences [wd4,2-2] any wrongdoings and then deter them from committing crime. This is why we have always been advocating the importance of law and order and punishing those vicious criminals in a stricter and stricter way. If we abolish the prison system and put our hopes on the rehabilitation of the criminals which may result in nothing, our society will suffer from the endless turmoil brought by our pampering the perverse wrongdoers. In a sense, our society is civilized only in terms of worldly possessions. As to people's moral consciousness. [sn2,s] it is still far from being civilized. We are now having various innumerable evil persons in almost every corner of our society. They will not be easily reverted to good. Our futile efforts of preaching the gospel to those who don't believe in God will end up with nothing but a more chaotic society.  	Both in China and in western countries, due to the daily corrupting moral standard, the commitments [wd3,s] of crimes tends to increase rather than reduce. This severe situation indicates that pure rehabilitation is hardly effective in presenting us a steady and prosperous society. No matter how much more efforts we make to rehabilitate those corrupt persons, they may on the contrary feel relieved at our softhearted and merciful treatment and then feel contempt for all the laws and orders. It is no doubt that such a rehabilitation [np5,-] will only connive at more and more evils.  	Our society is now developing with much heartening progress and fighting against any evil trend. To maintain the steadiness and to provide our people with a daily prosperous life, we need to resort to the deterrent force of law and order of which the prison system is a major element. So we ought to strengthen it instead of abolishing it. The naive idea of putting hopes on rehabilitation is certainly unreasonable and not workable.  (t2-2)  	Some people say its [wd3,-1] better deal [vp4,2-] with the criminals by rehabilitating rather than imprisoning them. Is it time to say this society has been so civilized that we should give up prison system? Is the prison system now outdated? I'm afraid not.  	All along the history [pp1,3-] of human race, when a nation was founded, together with it there must be a series of state apparatus, such as the central government, military force [np6,6-] as well as prison [np6,3-] Military is for national defense while prison system is also a kind of defense system to separate criminals from orderly life, to prevent the trouble-makers from doing further harm to the society. The prison system appeared and will disappear along with the nation itself. So long as the nation exists, the prison system will always be a symbol of state power and never be out-dated.  	Someone argues that to lock the criminals up is violating the human rights. But, when a person commited [fm2,-] a crime that had endangered [vp6,s-] people's life, had made [vp6,s-] others suffer either physically, spiritually, financially or all of the above, and had caused [vp6,s-] disorder in the public life, he is definitely violating other people's rights of enjoying a good and peaceful life. Then why should we let him still have so many [cc4,-1] freedom to misbehave and why shouldn't he pay for all he'd done? When the problem of prison system is discussed together with the human rights, what matters is not 'human rights' or "civil rights" but social order and economic success. That one mishaves [fm1,-] as he pleases has come at the expense of orderly society. The price of fight [cc3,1-1] crime will be paid by crooks and trouble-makers, not by law-abiding citizens.  	Actually, [wd4,-2] prison system and rehabiliating [fm1,-] are not a pair of [np9,-1] contradiction [np6,3-] Each has its advantages and disadvantages. Neither is prison system out-of-date nor is rehabiliating [fm1,-] unacceptable. We can use either of them in different cases. In the case of American boy Michael Fey, 18, who in Singapore was sentenced for crimes of vandalism to four months in prison, a $2,220 fine and also six lashes with a cane on his buttocks, it's too much for his first offense (Anyhow, it's Michael's bad luck to be convicted in Singapore--- a Tough [fm3,1-1] Tow [fm1,2-] based on tight discipline ). To be fair, rehabiliating [fm1,-] him will be quite justifiable for this case, for we'd rather hope that the young man forms an outlook on life in his early age with less scars either in body or in mind.  	But it's totally different in the case of John Wayne Gacy, the undisputed champion among American serial killers, who was proved to have murdered 33 young men and boys between 1972 and 1978. Nothing can be done to improve his personality or change his way of looking at this world. Imprisoning him all life long only meant to let him off lightly, let alone rehabiliating [fm1,-] him.  	All in all, to crack down against [wd3,3-1] anything that threatens the public order and to provide [vp1,1-6] for the security of its citizens are all governments' [np5,s-] first responsibility. We need to control the situation and either the prison system or rehabiliating [fm1,-] will be of help in the long run.  (t2-3)  	Some people say we are now in a civilised society, and we should get rid of the prison system which always reminds us of savage, violence, and inhumane things. But I think we still need it. It plays an important role in the social security.  	To those people a civilised society may mean a society full of friendliness, politeness, sympathy, justice, etc. No violence is supposed to exist. But actually our society is far from that perfect state. There are a lot of people who are rather selfish, shameless, contemptible, and with no sense of duty. For example, a driver knocked down a boy on the road. But instead of sending him to a hospital, he fled and left the boy bleeding to death. Then, A young man killed his mother just because she refused to give him the money he wanted for gambling. I don't think those are shocking news to most of us, for we've got used to living in the shadow of crimes and violences [np5,-]  	What we mean by "civilised society" is a society that has got out of the primitive stage of human society. Science and technology have been greatly improved, and people are living a more and more comfortable life, we can say computer is something "civilised", and so are space shuttle, five-star hotels, medicines that can release you from your diseases in 24 hours. Maybe morality is included as well, but people often ignore it rather than take it into account. That is why a society like the U.S. with such a high criminal [cc1,-1] rate can be called a "civilised society", while a tribal society, no mater [fm1,1-] how friendly those people are, is called an "uncivilised society".  	Our society is full of crimes and violences [np5,-] Only the prison system can keep it in good order. Suppose someone kills a person he hates very much, and he doesn't get executed by shooting, not even been sent [vp9,s-] into prison, so why don't you kill the woman who always make fun of you? In several days the whole society would be thrown into confusion. Of course this will not happen. The picture of the dark and damp rooms in the prison will sent [vp9,1-] a shiver down your spine. And the heavy sound of the handcuffs or shackles will take the strength from your body. So most people would control their bad impulse. Singapore is a country with rather low criminal [cc1,-1] rate. It is largely due to its severe laws. A very small amount of drug can be enough to make [vp1,-2] you spent the rest of your life in prison, so very few people dare to traffic in drugs there. Corporal punishment like whipping also prevent [vp3,5-] people from breaking the laws.  	People may point out the punishment there is too cruel and inhumane, and, is "uncivilised". But let's see what those "civilised" punishment would lead to. In the U.S. some of the states have abolished capital punishment, and some people who have committed crime can even give bail to secure their freedom. Laws almost lose their effects. Some people deliberately break the laws to proof [wd2,1-] their courage or to express their grievances. Robery [fm1,-] rape, murder, and other crimes happen everywhere and at any time. People living there can't get a sense of security.  	In addition, prisons also offer a special place for those who have broken the law to cool down and thought [vp4,s-] of his past. They may feel lonely and may regret that they have spent so much time doing senseless things. Then they can design their future again. When they come out, they can become a useful man to the society. Life in prison can make you feel sick and you will never want to go back there again. You will have to learn to control yourself.  	The prison system is never outdated. If there are crimes and violences [np5,-] in the society, there need [vp3,1-2] to be such a system to protect us and ensure us a peaceful life.  (t2-4)  	Some human rights activists preach that any civilized society should get away with prisons and that criminals should not be punished but rehabilated [fm1,-] Is that really logical?  	If such argument is right, then none of the states that has ever existed is civilized, including US, UK, Japan and many other developed countries. Because in all these countries, prisons not only exist, but will continue to exist. [sn2,s] The last thing in the world any government will do is get rid of prisons. Because the society will be in a [wd5,1-1] chaos [np5,1-] and the government may lose its power. Thus such nations are uncivilized and will persist in maintaining the status quo. Isn't it ridiculous to say that the American, or any nation which claims to be or is considered to be devoloped [fm1,-] and civilized is still uncivilized?  	Prison, together with court, army and police, is the component of what is called state machines. From the title, it is not difficult to tell what important role such machines play in the smooth operation of state government and organizations. They guarantee the public security is working in the right track. What are court, army, or police used for if criminals are caught, found guilty but have no prison to stay in? Prison in itself, [sn9,s-] is not a hell where prisoners are tortured either physically or spiritually. It offers a place for those who have done wrong to meditate, repent, realize their mistakes and receive reeducation through labor and study. They may learn essential skills in prison and use these skills to make contribution to the society.  	Closely connented [fm1,-] with prison is punishment. Inprisonment [fm2,-] in fact is a kind of punishment which is much more severe than fining. They [wd7,-d] are as different as a shop-lifter and a murderer. The punishment for the former one is comparatively slight because though it breaks the owner's right to his property, it is not as serious as the latter one which deprives a person of his life. And the murdered [fm1,-] has to answer for the crime he has committed. As an Chinese old saying goes, "Evil will be recompensed with evil". We cannot and have no right to fine a murderer 10 thousand dollars, because life is priceless. Besides, such penalty is as useless as trying to cure a sore by talking over it.  	Ancient China is one of the four ancient civilized nations in the world. At that time, penalty was severe but fair, so people dare not break the laws, for the price would be too high. In such a social invironment [fm1,-] where laws and rules were properly obeyed and carried out, people's living standard improved, economy grew, political life was stable, which resulted in a real civilized nation. Modern Singapore is another perfect example. People who spit on the street are heavily fined or even thrown into prison. Due to its strict and impartial laws and disciplines, the country is able to beautify its environment and keep it, which gains the state a beautiful name --- Garden City.  (t2-5)  	In recent years, some human right champions argue that the prison system is outdated, and no civilized society should punish its criminals, it should rehabitate [fm1,-] them. The idea of abandoning prisons and letting millions of criminals wander in streets from Washington to Beijin [fm1,-] frightens people and will provoke a great unrest [np5,3-] I consider proposal like this is completely illogical and unacceptable. The present prison system should not be abolished, on the contrary, it should be consolidated and strengthened.  	In the first place, those human right fighters who claim prouldly [fm1,-] the place they live is "civilized" must make a tremendous mistake of over-assessing. In term [fm1,-] of laws and orders, in term of personal security, they'd better cease calling a society which fails to prevent hundreds of innocent people from becoming victims of crimes everyday a civilized one. [sn8,s] Can a society in which notorious criminal activities as terrorism, drug abuses, massacring dozens of people in the small coffee shop, kidnapping girls and forcing them to become prostitutes take place as common as homely food be said to be "civilized"? Does the bombing which claimed people's lifes [fm2,-] in the New York International Trade Center, one of the most populous building in the world deserve the honor of "civilized"? The brutality of crime is shocking and the crime rate is skyrocketing. All these prove that the society haven't [vp3,2-] qualified the credit of "civilized". From this point, many will concede that the small country of Singapore which is famous for its excellent public security is not less civilized than many economically highly developed countries. Singapore, a target of being frequently criticized [cc3,5-] and condemned [cc3,7-] by some human rights oganization [fm1,-] for its tough punishment against criminals, however, boasts [vp1,-s-] the lowest crime rate in the world and becomes [wd4,1-5] most safe and livable place to live [vp1,s-] It is obviously [wd2,2-1] that one has a much lower statistic chance of being murdered or robbed in the street of Singapore than that in New York.  	Secondly, the current prison system not only works as a method of punishment for those who deserve it, but also has the singnificence [fm1,-] of warning and education. China has the old sayings, "Killing a chicken before a bad money [wd3,s-] is to show him a lesson" and "executing one as a warning to a hundred". If, unfortunately, the prisons were all abolished, one who commits crime won't face the deprival of freedom. That is to say killing a people [wd3,2-] or robbing a bank is no more than listening to a discourse by those kind-hearted, sympathetic rehabilitaters; and the awing appearance of iron windows of prisons become [vp3,s-] amiable faces of old preachers. This proposal will surely enjoy a clear welcome among criminals and those who are ready to break some laws but still fear of [wd3,1-1] being thrown into prison. The result of that is more and more vulnerable young [wd4,3-1] join the army of crime fearlessly and the heart broken bereaveds [fm2,-] look at the offenders roving idly in the street after being rehabilitated.  	Since the world we live [vp1,3-1] is not as [wd5,2-2] so civilized as one would image [wd2,s-] and the people are not equally civilized as they may be, we have to strenthen [fm1,-] the legal force to protect the majority. Obviously, if the buttock of that bold American teenager who damaged cars and public places in Singapore were not flogged, there would be more adventurous fellows to follow suit.  (t2-6)  	During the thousands of years of human being's existence, there are some things which are everlasting. Among them, love, benevolence and knowledge are those people never cease to pursue. With equal passion, men have never stopped hating evils. It seems that evil is always a [np7,-1] accompaiment [fm1,-] to the human society. Since it is not outdated, the device to combat it can not be outdated. The prison system remains a good way to make the society more agreeable to live in.  	Some people say that no civilised society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them. But I think if you do not punish them, you can not rehabilitate them. Do you still remember how you get the lessons through punishment when you were a little child? You did not believe what your mother told that you can not play with fire. You went to the stove when your mother was busy washing the vegetables at the other side of the kichen [fm1,-] and put your fingers on the fire! Whaw! Now ever since then, you remember that you would get burnt if you do not handle the fire properly. The burn was a punishment and because of it you learn something you may never forget. The imprisonment to a criminal is more or less the burn to a child. If you do not put the man who has robbed the bank and killed a woman into prison, how can he realize what unhappiness and catastrophy [fm1,-] he has brought to the society and a particular family? Maybe he would regret for what he has don [fm2,2-] but that is not enough. Pain and suffering are more effective [wd4,s-] the regret in making men remember what they did and in warning them off the repetition of their guilt or crimes [sn8,s-] So, don't you think that punishment is a way of rehabilitating?  	Apart from what has been mentioned above, prison has other evidences to support its existence. Prison is a comparatively good place for the criminals to rehabilitate themselves. The world outside is very colorful and filled with temptation. Some people may be in a poor position to control their desires for money, power, etc and easily fall in the trap of committing crimes. If you have stolen a large sum of money together with precious pearls after 2 nights' work, but "unfortunately" you are discovered and arrested. But some one is follish [fm1,-] enough to think that leaving you to yourself is the best way to rescure [fm1,-] you. Do you think under such circustances [fm1,-] you can resist the temptation of wealth? Remember you are free! The prison system seems much more reasonable in this aspect. It limits the wrong-doers to the high walls and the small and dark cells, separating them from those which or who would lure them to the wrong way. If you are not facing the delicious chicken, it is natural that you would not devour it against your mother's will and will have time to calm and control yourself.  	In addition to punishing the criminals, prison system has another important purpose, ie, to prevent the crimes from being committed. If you know beforhand [fm1,-] that you have to give your life up once you murder another, would you insist in [wd3,2-1] shooting your disgusting neighbour? The effect of warning people away from crimes is very important, because once the crimes have been committed, whatever you do you can not compensate for the destruction. The loving father can not be reproduced for the little children; the confidence can not be reestablished in the woman who has cheated [vp7,s-] ; the fright can not be moved off people's mind after they have seen [vp1,1-6] so many ugly things happened around. So, to prevent crimes is, in a sense, more important than to punish and rehabilitate the criminals. Hence, a severe punishment system is required, whose achievement is undeniable. Take Singapore as an example, if you connect the orderly society enjoyed [vp5,s-] world-wide praise with the severe punishing devices, you have to agree that:  	Prison system can not be abolished and it will function as long as the devil exists.  (t2-7)  	In modern society, the types of criminals are various, and the motive and means of crimes become more and more strange [aj3,3-] and cruel [aj3,5-] They smuggle drugs and sell them in [wd3,2-2] high price [cc1,1-] to poison people. They kill tens of persons just to satisfy their aberrant personality. The bank robbers make the nation lose money and affect the normal economic operation. Their existences [np5,-] pollute the social mode, theaten [fm1,-] the security of the public and even the nation. These can't be curbed unless the criminal law and the prison system are strengthened to punish the criminals severely.  	It is undeniable that rehabilitation is one of the ways to reform a criminal. But only the people who just slightly break the law and haven't lose [vp9,1-] their conscience are concerned. It is reasonable for a person to do something wrong by momentary impulse or the ignorance to the law. As they are made to realize their error, they will correct their behavior and begin their lives anew. But is it possible for rehabilitation to be efficient to those who know their evil quite well but insist in [wd3,1-2] doing so? Drug producers and dealers, who are crazy about money and have nothing human in their personality, transport drugs to every corner they can reach of the world and use all kinds of means to entice people to take drugs, especially the youth. Drug-taking is a [np7,-1] easy way for the inflection of AIDS. The price of drugs are [vp3,4-] so high that it causes other side crimes such as robbery, fraud, and so on. Don't they know these consequences? They creat [fm1,-] a state-like hierarchy and own a group of private body-guards armed with the most advanced weapons to protect them from being arrested. We even have no chance to sit down and talk to them face to face still less to rehabiliate [fm1,-] them.  	Some people may argue that the prison system is contradict [wd2,1-3] to human rights. But when a doctor in America rushed into a bar and shot twelve people dead and injure [vp6,s-] more. [sn9,d] did he ever concern about this problem? The constitution confers its citizen the equal rights of survival fairly. Once a person infringe [vp3,s-] other people's rights, he has lost his own at the same time. When the doctor deprive [vp3,s-] [cc3,-8] the living rights of so many innocent people, he should use his life to make up for it. The death of those who traffic in women and children and break up many happy families can never pay for the loss they have caused, while being sentenced in prison is too light a punishment for them.  	In a sense, severe punishment can also prevent the criminal cases from happening. knowing [fm3,s-] the result, criminals may think twice before they decide whether to challenge the law or not.  	A civilised society means most people's basic rights is [vp3,4-] guaranteed. Low criminal rate is a symbol. To achieve this goal in the contemporary social situation, which some of the citizens can't yet conform to the law of their own accord, it is still necessary to maintain the prison system.  (t2-8)  	Recently an American teenager was caned by the Singapore government for committing sandalism [fm1,-]. This caused quite a stire [fm1,-] in the U.S.. A number of people are against this corporal punishment. Some even think that no civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them.  	First we must bare [wd3,2-2] in mind that Singapore has a very good social order because it enforce [vp3,1-3] the rule of law strictly. America advocates the so called human right to such an extend [pp2,3-] that it run [vp3,1-] wild. Every minute there will be a crime committed in the States. This can hardly be called a civilized society. It is necessary for the society to have prisons to maintain a good social order. If we want to protect the human right, we should punish the criminals. It is they who violate other people's human right first. If we do not punish them, in means we do not respect other people's human right.  	In the second place, criminals can not be rehabilitated, not in the society at lease. There is really no point in keeping a criminal walking around us, plotting to committ [fm1,-] a crime next time. We should lock them up in prison until their behavior are [vp3,2-1] regulated. It is not realistic to rehabilitate those hundreds of thousands [wd4,3-1] criminals, some of whom are deadly dangerous. If we released [vp6,s-] them and they just flip the trigger of their guns and kill a bunch of people, it is too late then to seek a remedy. People are already dead (possibly includes [vp5,s-] those generous people who want to rehabilitate them). So this is the price of generosity, this is the price of rehabilitation.  	Let us have an other [fm2,1-] look at the Singapore society. It is a very clean and orderly society. With a population of 2.7 million, Singapore had 58 murders and 80 rapes last year, compared with 1,058 murders and 1,781 rapes in Los Angeles. It's the strict enforcement of punishment that make [vp3,s-] this civilized city. But on the other hand, America is really a land of violance [fm1,-] Over the last three decades violent crime has increased by more than 500 percent. Nearly three out of every four convicted criminals are not incarcerated. Fewer than one in 10 serious crimes results in imprisonment. The Americans are too "humane". Take an obvious example, there are [vp3,1-6] much more vandalism in the U.S. than in Singapore because the punishment is totally different. In the U.S. a person committed [vp5,s-] scandalism may probably be fined a maximum of $750, ordered to pay some restitution and put on probation. The American teenagers [np6,s-] in Singapore was sentenced to four months in prison, a $2,220 fine and six lashes with a cane on his buttocks.  	The former premier of Singapore Lee Kuan Year recently told an magazine in America that, "The expansion of the right of the individual to behave or misbehave as he pleases has come at the expense of orderly society." So we can see that a civilized society can not exist without punishing the criminals. The criminals must be responsible for what they did. Only when the policy of "law and order" is enforced can the public feel safe and civilized.  (t2-9)  	Some people said that prison system is outdated and a civilised society should offer mercy to the cirminals [fm1,-] I don't agree with them.  	In any civilized society there exist groups of people who are uncivilised whom I narrow [vp1,s-] down to refer [vp1,s-] to criminals. The government usually treats them with different ways to protect the civilized people. For the civilized people always obey the laws anywhere and anytime [fm2,-] and bring about great benefits to the society [sn2,s-] On the contrary [fm1,-] criminals do [cc3,-2] great threat [np6,3-2] to others. They prefer breaking laws and regulations rather than [pp1,12-]obeying them, because they regard it as a fun, or as excited [aj4,2-1] moments [np3,s-] in their life. They are harmful in all sorts of fields. Criminals in [wd4,2-2] economic field like money [cc1,1-1] corruption [wd7,2-] destroy the normal domestic economy. Criminals in [wd4,2-2] political field like attempting to overthrow the government [wd7,s-] ruin the stability of a country, to name a few.  	No severe punishments [np6,2-] is the best way to protect [wd3,s-] the crime. Though the Bible told us to "love our enemies", it's proved to be impossible in reality and it's not accepted by any country. We can't give our freedom to the criminals who receive it and cause lots of trouble to us. Their freedom means poison to the civilised citizens. Light punishments are like a breeze in the spring which blows [vp1,s-] softly to the face of the crime. Criminals pay not a slice of attention to them. Then more and more criminals emerge and emerge. More and more wounds the country will receive. We can't wait for the terrible time to come to realize. Each of the citizens has to be at home. There is no man walking on the roads [np6,s-] in [wd3,d] 24 hours. And not a policeman is seen in the police station, because the crime has frightened them to death. All the criminals are enjoying themselves everywhere and anytime, for there are no prisons or jails. All the citizens are trembling to wait for them to rob or hurt everyone. Then, people fled abroad or they met each other in the tombs. Finally, a family disappears, then a town disappears, then comes the end of a city, and then a country. Only when the criminals are completely beaten and thrown into prisons and willing to get rid of the habits of breaking laws, will the society be a real civilised one.  	The crime weakens the world reputation of a society. Only severe laws can save it. Singapore has won the world reputation of the most perfect state in carrying out the laws for at least a decade. Security is really satisfying in the people's mind. The vigor of executing [wd2,1-3] of the laws makes for it. A criminal who sells drugs or murders a person or kidnaps or owns guns is sentenced to death by hanging him. The criminal who robs is sentenced to 24 whips as punishment. Therefore, the public toilets, the public telephone rooms, the stations and the benches in parks are new and as clean as being washed. The government and the people say that whipping a criminal shows the strict laws. The permission to recuperate his health shows the mercy of the laws. And the great pain in the body can lead him to the right path. The facts have proved it a truth. The criminals who have been put into jails for dozens of times never dare to break any law after they've been whipped. In America, they're killers, street gangs and youth gangs in Los Angeles, in New York and in Detroit. People can't help asking [vp1,s-] why not whip them in stead [fm2,1-] of making the prisons crowed [fm1,3-]?  	Considering [vp1,-s-] for the sake of a better future for the world and for the human beings [sn3,s-] prisons and rigorous laws will not die as the passage of the time.  (t2-10)  	Some fellows argue that the present prison system is outdated. They say a criminal should not be punished. I find those arguments ridiculous.  	How can we prevent the commission of crimes? We should establish a punitive system. This system functions as a sort of deterrent force against crime. Everyone in our society knows that he would receive punishment if he committed a crime. The punishment forces those, who want to achieve sth. by foul means, to abandon their intension. The prison system is the system we have set up against law offense.  	The prison system is a threat to the potential criminals because the punishment of this system is severe. After a criminal is thrown into prison, he lost [vp6,s-] his freedom and is confined in cell. The cell is usually dark, stuffy, damp and dirty. There is hardly any amusement activity in prison. The food available in the prison is bad and scarce. Ordinary people loath [fm1,-] that food. Prisoners must do hard labour work. There are strict regulations in prison. Prisoners can not shout or argue. They must get up and go to bed at a fixed time. If they break one of these regulations, they will be punished. The punishment of captivity is really hard. This makes a potential criminal hesitate before their [np9,s-] commission, and oblige [vp3,s-] them [pr3,s-] to give up their evil intension.  	In the light of morality, captivity as a kind of punishment, [sn9,s-] represents the theory of equality and fairness. A criminal has done something wrong. He or she has brought loss to other people or our society. We can say that in fact he has imposed some loss on other people or our society. So equally, some punishment should be imposed on the criminal. This is a fair matter. Someone may argue that since the misfortune has happened, since the loss can not be saved, we should be kind not to bring suffering to more people, including the criminal. But suppose you are the victim or the victim's relative or friend, how do you feel. You would keep your hatred and indignation until the criminal is punished. Punishment is necessary for the reassurance to the victim, both psychologically and substantially.  	We can imagine the chaos of our society without the prison system. The criminal are [vp3,2-] released after the so called rehabilitation. They feel no pain. Moreover, they taste the sweet fruit of their offense. The [wd3,s-] achieve their aim at little expense. They become bolder and bolder. So murdering, kidnapping and theft take place anywhere at any time. The society is in such disorder that only the evilest and the most vicious can survive. All the kind-hearted people would die out.  	From the above, we can see that the prison system is necessary in our society. If this system is done away with, then, our society is done away with.  (t2-11)  	I'm strongly against this opinion. A society without the [wd3,3-2] prison system cannot be called as being civilised [sn8,s] It will surely be in a disastrous mess.  	Imposing proper restrictions on people's activities and thus protecting the interests of the vast majority of people is the basic function of a society. The prison system is an effective way to force people to abide by the law. The idea of being locked up and facing a white wall all day and all night has prevented many people from doing foolish things. Otherwise, the criminals will be swollen with arrogance, commiting [fm2,-] all kinds of outrages. And the mass [np6,s-] will be the poor victims. In New York, as the prison being [sn8,s-] too crowded, many criminals are freed soon after being arrested. As a result they aren't afraid at all, visiting police office just like visiting an old friend. The city thus becomes the most dangerous place in the world. Walking even on a busy street after 8:00 in the evening is regarded as risking your life. Every one in the city lives in a constant state of anxiety. Let's take Singapore, well known for its safety, as another example. It's [wd3,-2] government makes extremely severe laws to punish the criminals. A misdemeanor can cost your legs, hands or even lives. These relentless punishments make people here possible to live and work in peace and contentment. It's exactly the prison system that causes such great difference between these two countries. Although now we have entered into a civilised society, the criminals' quality is still far behind the level of giving up their criminal behaviors voluntarily. On the contrary, once you're a little softhearted to them, they will only be more savage and aggravated. Then finally our society will be destroyed.  	Some people criticise the prison system as [wd3,4-4] violating the human right. But do they think about the victims' human rights? They are so young, so vigorous. They still have a lot of colorful dreams. Just the day before, they may be planning the world travel, spending birthdays with friends, or having romantic dinners with their lovers. But suddenly all are [vp3,1-] destroyed by the criminals. Looking across the table at a vacant chair, climbing into an empty bed, feeling the pain of no voice, no touch, no love, their relatives mournfully call their beloveds' names in dreams and memories. But while these miserable people are suffering, the criminals only have a slight punishment. Is it fair? What kind of human rights these so called activists are protecting?  	Some people also argue that the society should rehabilitate them instead of using the prison system. The problem is that they think too highly of the society. If these sinful criminals can be so easily rehabilitated, our world would be much more simple. But actually, their criminal psychology is formed as early as childhood. They can only be rehabilitated effectively in prison by being forced to work and study for a long time. Most of them are uneducated, [sn9,s] study can help them to know their mistakes. But let [vp5,s-] them study voluntarily is surely impossible.  	Replacing the prison system is only an idealistic wish of kind people, but it has nothing to do with present reality. If we want a better life, keep this system.  (t2-12)  	There exist in the human body unprincipledness [fm1,-] and violence. Laws and Regulations come into being, restricting people's behavior and the evil souls. So long as the human being remains in the untamed stage of its development, there is necessity of existence for the laws and regulations.  	Singapore is a country well known for its strictness of laws enforcement, and is famous for its principled and safe social environment. Let us have a glimpse of its laws. In order to obtain a hygienical surrounding, heavy fines come into the law --- if you spit, feed birds or chew gun in public, you will be fined 1,000 Singapore dollars. Its laws preserve an old traditional punishment --- whipping. The lash is so severe that almost no criminals can get through two lashes. It's said that people who have ever got lashes, never commit any crime later in their lives. Singapore bases its survival on tough principle and severe punishment. And this brings only benefit to itself. People enjoy their lives, while the nation is booming as one of Asia's four little dragons.  	Look at the States, you may get the opposite. People can easily get a pistol legally. Don't mention how easy it is to get one through the underworld. The terrible result thus caused is that the murders by gun increase tremendously. Its slackness in enforcing the laws is a fatal weakness. Criminals can be released on bail. That is a hard question. Are they sure that the criminals will stop violating the laws later? Living in an environment where you have to, now and then, look over your shoulders in the street, where you put around your dwellings barbed fence, are you glad to claim that you are really enjoying a happy life?  	From the comparison between the two countries, you see what an important role the law and its enforcement play in a civilized society. No laws, no civilized society. You may disagree with me on this. But there is one point you surely accept --- human beings are not yet on such a high plane that they would all be devoted to a clean, smoothly functioning society, they would all care about others, they would all become completely conscientious, they would all thoroughly get free from evillish [fm1,-] desires. Once the evil in the soul runs wild, which is usually the case when people commit a crime, it will inevitably cause harm and misery on somebody else. To prevent and curb the evil, prisons emerge as an effective way. It's certainly better to confine the evil than to let it stay at large. But prisons don't stop going no further: it is loaded with the task to reform the sinners. I think China does better in this aspect, due to its wise policy on the prison system.  	Some human rights activists go to extremes and say that we should not punish criminals, we should rehabilitate them. I would say it is too early to do so. Instead, we should accordingly punish the criminals and make an example of them, and the prison system should still maintain its essential role in securing a civilized society.  (t2-13)  	As the by-product of flourishing economy, the criminal [cc1,-1] [wd3,-1] rate is increasing at a shocking speed. So naturally the prison system gradually become [vp3,s-] the hot topic among people. Some people think Government should maintain the strict prison system to get rid of crime, while others say the prison system is outdated, [sn9,s-] no civilied [fm1,-] society punish [vp3,2-] its criminal [np6,s-] it should rehabilitate [vp1,2-]  	People who take the first opinion are mainly in some Asian countries like China and Singapore. In these countries, there are [vp3,1-4] a set of perfect, amplify [wd2,4-2] prison system [np6,6-] According to the different degree [np6,2-] of their crimes, the criminals have to stay in prison for several or a lot of years. It can be called the price for their crimes. But on the other hand, it also can be called a good opportunity for those criminals to know themselves anew and remould themselves in prison. For those fierce killers or other cruel criminals, there are [vp3,s-] death penalty as well. In some western countries, death penalty is regarded as unhumanitarian, but it is this system that make [vp3,s-] an impact of "execute one as a warning to a hundred", [sn9,s-] it has offered the society a good public order and guaranteed the security of people and their property.  	As for the people who say the prison system is outdated, criminal [np6,s-] should not be punished and should rehabilitate mainly are those so called "humanitarian" [np6,s-] in western countries. Regarding [vp1,s-] that the prison system is cruel and unhumanitarian, they adopt other ways of punishment for criminal [np6,s-] such as to fine [wd4,1-1] criminal a certain number of money for his crime, or to accept a bail [np5,1-] etc. As a result of these "humanitarian" system [np3,2-] the furious and wealthy criminals are still at large, even continue to commit crime, because they think everything can be resolved with money. The worst thing is that other people will take them as examples. It is the reason why in the western countries, the criminal [cc1,1-1] rate increase [vp3,3-] at a dramatic speed and people dare not go out in the evening.  	Nowadays, some Western countries attack China's prison system, [sn9,s-] they always say there is no human rights in China. As for this question, we should know first what is [np3,-2] human rights and what consist [vp3,s-] of it? As [cj1,s-] the rights which it is generally thought that every living person should have, human rights include a lot of rights, but the bas [fm1,1-1] thing is people's security. Even it is threatened, how can we say to seek and defend other human rights [sn8,s-] ? So we must consider most people's security and right at first, that is to say, anyone who commit [vp3,3-] a crime should be punished. The prison system isn't outdated.  (t2-14)  	Prison is a place where wrongdoers are kept locked up. The system of using prison or like means to punish wrongdoers and to prevent further wrongdoing has a history as long as that of mankind's civilization. It is not outdated yet --- not until our society has reached the ideal state of having no wrongdoers, which seems unlikely in a long time to come.  	Recently the government of Singapore caned an eighteen-year-old American for vandalism. This has aroused much concern in America as to its rightness. Even President Clinton pleaded for him and threatened to use sanction on Singapore if necessary. The Human Rights Organization Amnesty said this was violation against the basic human rights. It insists that "No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them." To these, the Singaporean government replied: "That's why in America there aren't any clean walls while Singapore is one of the cleanest and most beautiful country [np6,7-] in the world. We should not enforce one law on our own citizens and adopt another for foreign citizens. Every one is equal before our law."  	The Singaporean Government has set up an example for the world --- to punish wrongdoers without hesitation. Punishment is the best way to rehabilitate criminals. Numerous facts have proved this. And prison is the best place to rehabilitate criminals, because if they are not locked up, they are most likely to continue their bad deeds, to disturb public orders and to harm others.  	Despite western countries' groundless accusation that China violates human rights, China is in fact quite successful in its prison system. Take Lingyuan Prison in Liao Ning Province as an example.  	Lingyuan, famous for one of its prisoners Liu Gang who is a prominent dissident in China and used to be a focus of western news media, was opened for the first time to a group of Chinese and American reporters. What they found there was a completely different picture from what the western media had reported. It is clean and tidy and well managed. The supervisors have good relationships with the prisoners. The prisoners have the right to appeal, to work (in the prison), to make suggestions, to vote, to meet family members, to be paroled for medical treatments and so on. There, they are assigned different work according to their physical conditions. They produce daily necessities to supply themselves. They learn at least one professional skill, so that after release, they can earn their living legally. Besides work, there are entertainments in prison, such as basket-ball matches, TV programmes. In addition, they can read books and attend to lectures. In fact, they are given a chance to re-eduate [fm1,-] themselves. It's not strange that some of them get satisfactory jobs after release and one or two of them may even pass the examinations and further their studies in universities. Ill treatments of prisoners are strictly forbidden. Humanitarinism [fm1,-] and patient persuasion are practiced along side with strict observance to regulations. The result is that the recidivism rate is only 0.2% while the national recidivism rate is 6% and that of the U.S. is 50%.  	Not all the prison system [np6,4-] work as well as the Chinese prison system. The crime rate is an indicator of how well it works. The crimes committed in Washington D.C. (with a population of 900,000) in January, 1994 equals the total crimes in Shaihai [fm1,-] (with a population of 18 million) in the past two years. It is said that in the U.S, the criminals go into prison an amateur [np3,s-] and come out a professional criminal [np3,s-] There must be something wrong with the management of prisons in U.S.. It is US' own responsibility to find out and change. But there is nothing wrong with rehabilitation through punishment and with the prison system itself.  	The Prison System is here to stay.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH ZD> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (t2-1)  	From time to time in the newspaper we read [vp1,-s-] that some criminals who have been set free do wrong and are sent to prison again. It makes me think a lot about if the prison system is useful for those criminals. My answer of the question is: The prison system is outdated.  	Every day we send those criminals such as thieves, murderers to prison for three main definitions. The first one is to confine them in the prison so they cannot do more harm to the society. The second one is to punish them. The third one is to give them chance to confess [vp1,1-2] then selive [fm1,-]  	Can we achieve the goals of setting [wd7,-1] prisons? As we all know [sn9,-] prison is like a hell. There is cold and dark. Every criminal cannot eat and sleep as common people and they have to do strenuous jobs. They have no freedom and are discriminated [vp1,s-] Every day they are scolded, "You are criminals. You have done something really bad. You have to be punished." Under such [wd4,2-2] horrible circumstance and under the great suppression, few of them can really become a normal person [np3,s-] again and the goals of setting [wd7,-1] prisons cannot be achieved.  	Every year thousands of prisoners try to run away from the prisons. If they succeed, they will revenge for their torture in prison. That means they will do more harm to people. They are not afraid of being arrested and sent to prison again. Since they can run away from the prison easily, it is just a place for them to have a rest.  	Because all those goals of setting [wd7,-1] prisons can't be achieved, the prison system is outdated. In this civilised society, we should rehabilitate the prisoners instead of punishing them and we should think about other ways to teach them.  (t2-2)  	Some people say, "the prison system is outdated. No civilised society should punish its criminals, it should rehabilitate them." I don't agree with [wd3,s-] this point of view. To rehabilitate the criminals without punish [wd2,1-] them is simply too good a wish to be practical.  	As we all know, nowadays the crime rate is increasing at an unbelievable [wd2,1-2] quick speed [cc4,1-] In the U.S., it is said that there is a crime being committed every seven minutes. Due to this, the most direct and effective way to prevent [vp1,-s-] to criminals from doing more harm to the society is to arrest them and punish them. The aim of punishment here is to let the criminals realize the binding force of law. If they were not punished, they would ignore the importance and binding force of law. The more they ignore the law, the more crimes they are tend [vp9,2-2] to commit.  	The prison system is not outdated. In most countries, the prison system serves two positive purposes, that is, to punish criminals as well as rehabilitate them. As a matter of fact, to rehabilitate criminals is the final end of the prison system. Some people violate the law out of ignorance of law, some out of an impulsive action, they are not doomed to death, they still have a chance to turn over a new leaf. It is the duty of the prison system to make them be able to live an ordinary life again, that is, to rehabilitate them. In the prison, the criminals come to realize how important labor is and begin to love labor through doing physical work. At the same time, they learn to be proud of self-reliance. After [wd4,1-1] educated and reformed by the law enforcement officials, they learn that committing crimes is shameful and know how to be law-abiding citizens. In China, there are a lot of examples about criminals being set free earlier after reformation. Most of them lead a new happy life after that. We can see that this is what the present prison system has accomplished.  	Surely, due to a lot of reasons, the current prison system is not perfect enough. Sometimes reformation is not well carried out. However, as long as the purpose is held that the prison system is to rehabilitate criminals rather than just punish them, it can be improved and become more and more effective.  (t2-3)  	I've ever heard that one great philosopher said "Nothing in the world is perfect, everything has two sides." Therefore, every matter has its defects as well as perfection, likewise [ad2,-] the prison system.  	On the basis of [wd4,3-3] above-mentioned principle, I don't deny that the current system has many holes, but in my opinions [np3,2-] we should not view it as "outdated or not", instead, we should view it from the angle of being effective or not. Here I want to make my position clear that any civilised society should and must punish its criminal. I am sure almost everyone including the criminals themselves are [vp3,s-] well aware of the significance of law enforcements [np5,-] which are compulsory acts implemented by government with the intention to punish the unlawful wrong doers, warn the the [wd6,1-1] would-be criminals, prevent the outlaws from committing crimes again, protect the citizen's property, rights, even their lives. In the past years, these punishment measures have contributed a lot in controlling [wd4,1-2] crime rate. I don't see any good in eliminating the current prison system. On the contrary, the abolition of punishment system are [vp3,s-] destined to produce immediate and negative results. For the criminals, they're willing to take advantage of this system for they know clearly that no matter what crimes they commit, they won't be punished, but be rehabilitated (I don't think only rehabilitation could make an outlaw become a good law-observer). For the citizens, they feel insecure for they know clearly that they are besieged in a society full of crimes, but they can not use law to protect themselves any longer. However, too much severity in punishment will lead to extremes. At the same time, some sorts of rehabilitation such as reforme [fm1,-] education program [np6,s-] are needed to remold their ideology.  	At last, my position to this question is emphatic: any civilised society should and must punish its criminals. It is an effective way to maintain the order and peace of one society, to keep the social, economic, political stability of one society, to protect [wd4,2-4] people of one society. In addition, the prison system which combines punishment with rehabilitation will be a better one for the two elements supplement each other.  (t2-4)  	I don't agree to this point of view. The prison system is not outdated. Furthermore, it is the most effective way to strike violent crimes [cc3,2-] and should be enforced more by the law.  	It is true that we now live in a civilized society. But it is not to say that our society is totally in order and security. On the contrary, it is getting more and more unstable and insecure. The rate of crime is increasing every year. Stealing, larceny, robbery, rape [np6,3-2] murder, manslaughter, etc. [sn9,s-] all these crimes are happening every day and everywhere in this "civilized society". Many people have no sence [fm1,-] of security and live all day in worry and horror.  	"Civilized society"! What a wonderful term! Yet isn't it the "civilized society" who [pr5,s-] should be responsible for all these evil things? In this materialistic world, money is everything. This is a popular saying which is almost accepted by everyone. And the blind cult of money is almost the source of all the crimes, except some bodily assaults. Some people are blinded by the lust for gains and attain their evil ends by hook, even at the cost of outraging the law. They do any vicious conducts [cc3,3-] and bring great harm to other people.  	To these bad guys [sn3,s-] who are extremely vicious and defy the law, how can we rehabilitate them by peaceful and kind means? If we do so, it will have no difference from conniving [vp1,1-1] them. So the prison system and all kind [np3,1-] of punishments are quite necessary and effective in reforming the criminals. They will know better behind the bars that they should pay correspondingly for what they have done to the society. And this is the only way to rehabilitate them.  (t2-5)  	The prison system has existed for thousands of years. However, the current situation is totally different from that of several thousand years ago, when the prison system was created. People are rich, well-educated, very polite etc. So some people claim that the prison system is outdated; [wd4,-2] civilized society should rehabilitate crimals [fm1,-] without the punishment of prisons.  	Nervertheless [fm1,-] if these people look into the American society, a generally-accepted rich and democratic country, they will find the reality is quite contrary to what they think. The United States has a high crime incidence, killing, raping and other crimes are being committed all the time. And the prisons of US are not enough to look up criminals [cc3,2-] This indicates the fact that the prison system is not outdated. In a sense, it is badly needed.  	The significance of the prison system lies in its deterrence from crimes. People enjoy the freedom, so they can do whatever is legally acceptable --- to travel around the world, to do the job they favour and so on. However, if someone commits a crime, he or she must be put in prison if not sentenced to death. As a prisoner, he or she lacks the basic freedom: everything is under the control of others. He or she has to do some job although he or she by no means likes it. In consideration of this, most of us resist the temptation to commit crimes.  	Furthermore, the punishment of criminals is absolutely necessary. It is impossible to image [wd2,s-] that a crimal [fm1,-] can get rid of all his or her vices by living the same life as other innocent people do. Probably he or she will not regret for what he or she has done, and commit a new crime. In order to lessen crimes, [wd4,-2] civilized society must maintain its prison system.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH SJD> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (t2-1)   The development of a society is rapid. Day by day, the society becomes more and more prosperous, civilized and powerful. People expect an ideal society, where there is no violence, no crime, and people can lead a peaceful life, and the whole world is full of love.   But, in reality, it seems impossible. Every day, even every moment, crime is happening somewhere. Crime is always a serious problem to a society. Why crime [wd1,s-] can not be cured [cc3,s-] while the society advances? I think the matter is the outdated prison system. No civilized society should punish its criminals. Instead, It should rehabilitate them.   We can imagine that in the middle aged [cc4,1-1] society, criminals were limited in dark, damp, dirty prisons. They were suffered [vp7,s-] not only torture, but the infectious diseases. Now, the living condition in prison is quite better. It seems more reasonable than before. In fact, some inhumane punishments are done [cc3,4-] to criminals. We can often see that from some reports from [wd4,1-1] media.   In my view, punishment will not prevent crime, maybe, it will lead to the worse. The society is past [wd7,s-] like a family, and its criminals are like the children. When a child has done something wrong and got a severe, unmerciful punishment, he would think that he lost [vp6,s-] the love from his family. He maybe will do something wrong again to make [vp1,-5] his family to notice him again. The criminals in the society have done something wrong too. The punishment in prison only teach [vp3,5-] [vp1,-2] them hating. They will become cooler, and perhaps do [cc3,-1] crime again. As a sequence [wd3,-] the criminals will feel no guilty about their crime. So punishment should not be done [cc3,5-] in [wd4,1-2] civilized society.   Criminals are sick. They should be patients, not prisoners. In some developed countries, delinquency is a big social problem. A child was born in a lowest level family, and have [vp3,s-] a drunk [wd3,1-1] father or an ignorant mother. He is lack [np1,1-2] of love and gets little education. He plays traunt [fm1,-] and learns how to steal, or to drug. How to treat such a delinquent? Punish him severely or persuade him to go the righ [fm1,-] way? I think he should be taught how to love, and he needs love too. We should make [vp1,-3] him to understand the world, the society should be beautiful. Everyone living in it should make the society more beautiful, not stain it. Maybe it is hard to make [vp1,-3] him to understand. We should try to do it.   Crime is hardly prevented, but we should reduce it to the least. Putting a criminal to prison is the primitive way. According to the development of society, we should find new way [np6,2-] Stopping punishment and making criminals rehabilitate is [vp3,s-] a better choice.   I have seen a report about a woman [np6,1-3] prison in Britain. There is no punishment. All criminals are free in it. They have their own rooms, entertainment supplies. And even they can work to earn money. Their husband [np3,1-] can visit them and live with them. The research shows that no one wants crime again.   That is a good proof that punishment is unnecessary in a modern civilized society. Everyone have [vp3,1-] the right to choose his way to live, and criminals also have [wd4,1-3] right to rehabilitate.  (t2-2)   Criminals are not the outcasts of our society but humane [wd2,s-] who can be taught to return [vp1,s-] our society. So it is more effective for the society to rehabilite [fm1,-] them than punish them. We should not rely so much on our traditional prison system because putting them into prison isn't the goal. Sometimes we have to agree that such simple punishment will make the situation worse.   In spite of [wd4,3-3] crowdedness in prisons, the rate of crime is rising rather than declining. Many criminals don't quit breaking the law after they are punished, because nothing have [vp3,1-2] been changed. What's worse, it gives them the feeling of being rejected and thus they grow the [wd3,s-] intention to look on the society as their enemy. Mike, an American, was sentenced to six months inprisonment [fm2,-] for drunk driving. He had to accept a devorce [fm1,-] during his seweing [fm1,-] Six months later, he found that his life would never be the same as before. Conponting [fm1,-] the relatives' and friends' avoiding him, he felt [wd1,s-] never had he been so lonely. He was fired and took [cc3,-3] great effort to find a new job but in vain. Driven to the edge of despair, he met Louis, one of his cell-mates in prison, who was charged of [wd3,3-2] bank robbery twice and had involved [vp7,s-] in a heroin case. From Louis, Mike found a spot of light, the friendship and equality. After one year, Mike was put into prison again for shooting a police [np5,1-] when he and his gang was [vp3,5-] seen breaking into a jewel [wd3,1-1] shop. In this case, our outdated prison system was not able to serve its role [cc3,3-] to stop crime [cc3,2-] On the contrary, it led to deeper [cc4,-1] colapse [fm1,-] of a person.   Sometimes, it is not only the criminal who should be blamed. What will [vp6,s-] happen to a sloven child with a drunk [wd3,1-1] father and a drug-addicted mother? What will [vp6,s-] happen to a teenager who lived in a shaking house and had no money to go to college? He joined the gang in which he could find his comparison [wd3,s-] He may take acid [wd7,s-] to escape from the reality. And then... All of these problems can not be resolved by panelty [fm1,-] They kept coming [wd5,s-] and going to the prison because outside the prison, they had got nothing to do. Unskilled and without any working experience, they couldn't make a living through legal way [np6,s-] May be [fm2,s-] they found the prison a shelter to protect them from being exposed on the street, to worry [vp1,-5] being attacked by other hooligans. It is hard to say whether the sentence of inprisonment [fm2,-] is really a punishment. [wd4,s-] Society shouldn't ignor [fm1,-] the cause and emphasizing [vp4,s-] the result. Punishment [cc2,-2] can't solve the poverty problem which leads to most of the crime. Besides taking the role as judger [fm2,-] [np6,1-] and punisher [fm2,-] [np6,1-] a civilized country can do more than that. Those men will return to our society if we help them to open a door.   Some reformation is already on its track, such as [pp1,1-s-] to allow the inmates to choose a kind of job training which they can receive in the prison. Some have gone [vp1,2-s-] further letting the criminal to live a normal life outside prison [wd4,2-2] under inspection [np1,1-] And they proved their worthy [wd2,3-2] of being trusted. They rarely win the chance they gained [vp6,s-] to return [vp1,1-2] our society. Maybe there are still a lot to do to help them, to help ourselves. Things are moving forward. With the civilization of the world, [wd4,-2] society will do better in rehabiliting [fm1,-] than [wd4,s-] punnishing [fm1,-]  (t2-3)  In 1810 a bill introduced in the British Parliament sought to abolish capital punishment for the offense of stealing five shillings or more from a shop. That was quite a controversy. Judges and magistrates unanimously opposed the measure. During the same year [sn2,s-] Parliament abolished the death penalty for picking pockets. That was a significant step in the process of civilization, I believe, because no civilized society should punish its criminals; it should rehabilitate them.   Many people who endorse punishment against criminals have a conviction that punishment can effectively secure our society. But, I think, the ground under them is shaky. Their fatal error consists in assuming that the whole aim of punishing criminals is to deter other potenlial [fm1,-] criminals. This is an assumption that confuses a part with the whole. Punishment, manifestly, is one of the ways to deter criminals, but it is certainly not the only one. On the contrary, there are at least half a dozen, and some are probably quite as important. At least one of them, practically considered, is more important. That is the so-called inculcation. When the objects of inculcation are criminals, it has a new definition --- rehabilitation. Inculcation usually suffers a [wd5,1-2] poor funding [np5,2-] in relation to the money spent in punishing criminals. [wd4,s-] Authority tends to ignore the relationship between inculcation and crime. But, in fact, its importance can't be overstressed. [wd4,s-] An informal survey of 208 of the 688 inmates at Michigan's Marquette Maximum Security Prison, a surpring [fm1,-] 9 out of 10 said that they had actually learned new tricks and improved their criminal expertise by watching crime programs. If the authority can spare a bit more money and attention on inculcation, it will save much revenues that should otherwise be spent on [wd4,s-] prison system in return.   Furthermore, the ultimate objective of prison is not at all to revenge [cc3,-2] the criminals for what they have done, but to help them resume their virtuous nature, to rehabilitate them. Punishment only means suffering, while rehabilitation means new life. One of my roommates once talked about a friend of his who had been imprisoned for three years and suffered a great deal. But all the punishment left him nothing but hurt. After release he swore that he would revenge. I believe that this is not the feeling of a sole inmate.   It is neither money-saving nor useful to punish the criminals. The defining feature of new prison systems should be REHABILITATION!  (t2-4)   There is a popular story: In class: [sn9,s-] a boy said "I have went". His teacher made him stay behind and write "I have gone" a hundred times. When the teacher read the paper, he found such a sentence in [wd3,s-] the end: "Dear sir, I finished all the lines, so I have went home."   Punishment can do nothing to help children to correct the mistakes. As to criminals, it is the same case. Punishment means we hate and fear something or somebody, so we want to change them [pr3,s-] How [wd3,-s-] should we do? Can we just put them in prison to be punished?   Criminals are different from the normal people. They are sick; they should be patients, not prisoners. They crime [wd2,s-] because they are not satisfied with the environment. They want to change their conditions and go up. Among them some try to be rich and powerful in any ways [np6,s-] they can use [cc3,4-] ; some want to find a haven of happiness in the sail of drugs [wd7,s-] which can not be found in this mad world of profit and pollution.   For a long time we have regarded the prison [wd3,s-] as an only method to change the criminals. Our ancestors invented it to put in the captives and rebels, and we followed the tradition. However, can the old prison- system be useful? Then officials have found that most criminals would crime [wd2,s-] again and again, as a matter of fact, after they were set from [wd3,s-] Obviously, punishment [cc2,-2] can solve no problem.   To change a criminal is not so simple. We must wake up his conscience. Most criminals have lost their consciences because they felt [vp6,s-] no love in the world. In their hearts they are eager for warmth, [sn9,s] only love can save them. This requires us to be sympathy [wd2,1-] and kind for [wd3,1-] them. At the same time, we must rehabilitate the society. Crime keeps increasing because wealth and privilege keep increasing. Today is an age of money-worshipped [wd2,s-] When some persons are running after money and power, they are forced to crime [wd2,s-] in spite of their consciences. Gradually they will go astray. Therefore, it is important for a country to purify its society.   At present many open prisons without bars have substituted for the old ones in some countries. One seldom read [vp3,2-] of an escape from such prisons. The prisoners are guided gently there. They receive traditional education and vocational training. They have jobs and even earn a little money which can be spent in the prison shop. They almost live a normal life except the restriction of freedom. Futhermore [fm1,-] it is the prisoners who administer themselves. In the self-govened [fm1,-] atmosphere [sn2,s-] Most prisoners want to go up. Later they seldom crime [wd2,s-] again.   To sum up, the old prison-system is out-dated. Any civilised society should rehabilitate the criminals instead of only punishment. Please remember that punishment can cure nothing.  (t2-5)   In our society, if someone commits crime, he will be sentenced and then be punished depending on how serious his crime is. Most of them will be sent to prison. There are many prisons among [wd3,s-] the whole country, most of which are at the far most desolate places. Prisoners spend their time doing hard work and receiving [wd4,1-4] so called [fm2,-] "moral education". Life is quiet [wd3,-1] simple and tedious there. After several painful years, so [fm1,-] of them will leave, back to the society, others will probably stay there all their life time.   This kind of prison system in our civilised society is outdated. It is no longer feasible. Take a close look at the recently released prisoners. After the hard work and moral education, they may be [fm2,1-1] want to be a good citizen and start a new life. The first thing is to find them a new job. As we know, to find a new job is not an easy thing for these people. Although you may be an expert at the prospective job, when the boss knows that you have been a prisoner, you will probably lose it. And in a computerized society, to hide one's dark background is almost an impossible thing. The society doesn't welcome these people. What will they do to live on? Hardly anything besides committing crimes. If they are arrested by the police again, they will be again [ad1,s-] sentenced and sent to prison twice [wd3,s-] Then is the third times [np5,2-] forth [fm1,-] times [np5,s-] [sn2,s-].. 	The original aim of setting prison [cc3,1-] is to eliminate the crime, but it seems prison doesn't work as we have planned, on the contrary, it produces somewhat [wd1,s-] criminals. What's wrong? To punish the criminals and put them in prison is a passive way, not a positive way. It can ont [fm1,-] provent [fm1,-] the happening of the crime, but only provent [fm1,-] the increasement [fm2,-] of the crime cases, [sn9,s-] sometimes, it can not even does [vp9,s-] this. In a civilised society, the first thing is not to think how to punish the criminal, but how to eliminate the crime itself. People should critize [fm1,-] the crime, point its harmness [fm2,-] and educate their next generation. Besides the economic booms, education should also be developed. Thus, in a both rich and civilised country, crime will be sharply reduced. But if some one [fm2,1-] still commits crime, should we punish him and put him into prison? No. Defenitely [fm1,-] no. On the contrary, we should rehabilite [fm1,-] him. Teach him how to become a new man, give him the work practice which he can live on afterwards. And the society will not against [wd4,s-] him, but willingly to help [vp4,s-] him correct his mistakes.   In a civilised country, if everyone is willing to help these people, give them a chance to show their regretness [fm2,-] show mercy to them. Then, what will prison be used for? It is useless. It is expectable [wd2,-] that in a civilised country, if people rehabilite [fm1,-] the criminals, [vp9,s-] not punish them, crime can be eliminated in the future.  (t2-6)   It is said that a person when he releases [vp1,-1] [sn9,s-] will be more dangerous than before. Generally, a criminal only had [vp6,d] a certain kind of guilt before he went into the prison. After the period in the prison, he will be gulity [fm1,-] of all kind [np3,1-] of evil. It showed [vp6,s-] that the gathering of sinners is more harmful than the singal [fm1,-]   Moreover, criminal education in the prison is more convenient and influenced [wd2,s-] among the prisoners. Out of the prisons, a person can meet decent people, contact with justice and take other's advice, [sn9,s-] But in the prison, there is only guilty [wd2,s-] [wd4,s-] Prison system is not a place [cc1,5-] to reform people's characters.  	I think the education and the media must be provided at first. Criminals have to be rehabitated [fm1,-] by everyone. A good adviser is more useful than the outdated punishment.   Foreign visitors had alway [fm1,-] been [vp6,s-] the victims of European pickpockets, purse snatchers, muggers and con artists. But today tho [fm1,-] criminals appear to be growing more dangerous. In Spain, where the crime rate is soaring in general tourists must contend with roving youths looking for ways to fleece the unsuspecting.   Of course, no mount [wd7,s-] of police protection can altogether prevent crime. In Seville Spain, youths knows [vp4,s-] [wd4,s-] 'traffic light thives [fm1,-] ' break into cars stopped at intersections, smashing the windows with crowbars to take purses and wallets from the passengers. After robbing the victims, they also [wd5,1-5] steal their cars as well, so the police won't hear about the crime for several hours.   Prison can't hold real criminals.   Nevertheless, if they had known that foreign travellers were their friends, who got [vp1,-6] them make profit in tourist trade, the citizens might have considered the problem. The consumers will be frightened by the robbers. Who will come?   And, [wd4,1-2] prison system can't prevent this kind of people from robbing. They couldn't help getting the money, which is too easy to take. Public opinion is more important for the social crimes. When people found [vp6,s-] they were [vp6,s-] also [wd4,3-1] trouble, they might be initiative [wd7,s-]   It's [wd7,s-] not always successful for the coercive measure. An uncompromising stand will get contrary result. More power, more gulity [fm1,-]  (t2-7)   The regularity [wd3,s-] that criminals should be put into prison has not been changed for about thousands of years. But recently some societists [fm2,-] point [vp6,3-] out that the [wd5,s-] criminals should not be put into the [wd5,s-] prison and they said the prison system was already outdated.   It is true that the prison system is so old that it can not satisfy [vp1,s-] the police to hold so many criminals. The rate of crime increases every day. Since 1980, in the United States, the rate of crime has staggered upward [cc5,1-] Even [wd3,-2] since 1970, the FBI's base [cc1,-1] year for evaluating recent trends, reports of crime have continued to increase drastically [cc5,-1] Every prison is full of birds. The government has to build new prisons to hold the games of the policemen. While the population is increasing and [wd5,s-] the rate of crime is also increasing. Then the government has to build more and more prisons. But the land is limited on the earth. Perhaps hundreds of years later, the criminals will be expelled to the moon or some other stars where human being [np6,s-] can survive.   But we are not the [wd5,s-] idealists and we should be more idealistic [aj1,2-4] to face the problem. Crime is a social problem. Some famous psychologist [np3,2-] had said [vp6,s-] "fight is a radical instinct; if men have nothing else to fight over, they will fight over words, faniuals [fm1,-] or woman, or they dislike each other's looks, or because [wd4,s-] have met [wd4,s-] walking in opposite directions. To knock a thing down, especially if it is corked [wd3,s-] at an arrogant angle, is a deep delight to the blood. And imagine that the world lived [vp1,2-3] [vp6,s-] only one person and whatever he does can not be regarded as crime. Because he could not hurt any other person [sn2,s-] Therefore, the instant enviroment [fm1,-] may be the main factor of many crimes. The society should be responsible for the criminals [wd3,d]   The society should not just put the criminals into the prisons. It should restore the criminals to a normal life. Otherwise, when these prisoners get out of the prison, they may crime [wd2,s-] again. But, how to restore these birds is a piece of hard work. First, the government should set up a criminal-restoring center. And the prisoners from different prisons will be sent to the center by turns. The socialists and psychologists must study the criminals [np4,1-2] personal record of the crime [wd4,s-] then make a plan to cure the "patient". If all these things turn to be true, it marks [vp1,-s-] the human civilization get [vp3,3-4] to a new level.   People always complain that we live in a world with so many crimes that we should get rid of them. I think that the goverment [fm1,-] has to do more research or [wd3,s-] the criminals and prisons. To protect ourselves, to protect those we love, and to protect our very existence, we must do something for the criminals, the prison birds, --- our "patients".  (t2-8)   Recently, I have read an article which stated that every year more and more prinsoners [fm1,-] committed suicide in American prisons. I wonder that now either economy, [wd4,s-] polical [fm1,-] or education have been developed so much, why so many people still have to be in such a desperate state that they take an illegal act which they are maybe [ad1,s-] unwilling to do [cc3,s-] with their natural instincts [wd7,s-] ; after being punished and rebuilt [wd3,-] so strictly, why someone still have [vp3,2-] the "chance" to go to prison for their second time; why someone who really realize [vp3,4-] their guilty [wd2,1-2] couldn't try to be a new one but confess their sins by destroying themselves [wd7,s-] ?   According to the modern criminal psychology, it is said that when a person's natural desire exceeds his moral principle which is acquired, not innate; [sn9,s-] he would tend to satisfy his need by infringing [vp1,-1] others. As a person was born, he had his natural requirement which formed the base of his future life. Everyone wants to eat well, live comfortably, love others and also be loved. Everyone has his own dignity and ambition. All these are beyond reproch [fm1,-] But as he grows up he would be taught [vp1,s-] what can be done and what can not. Then he could become a moralized one [wd3,1-] At last he enters the society. There are so many social evils. If he is not so high-principled, if his desire can't be satisfied violently, what can he do next? It [wd7,d] seems to be inevitable.   So the punishment is completely meaningless. In the heavily guarded prison, under the strict prison system, maybe some prisoners would realize that their illegal acts are unworthy compared with the unbearable physical suffering they get here. They know they do wrong just because they feel they have done a losing business. Then they try best to smooth over the fault. But when they are free, they find that they have been deserted by the society, they could not be equal to others any longer. And now they need more comfort and help which only can be gotten from their evil associates. Again all of them would be taken to prison. Also now most of the prisons have only miserable cells, food and almost no entertainment facilities, but enough implements of punishment and too much work. All these force a person not to introspect himself but to think how to free himself from all these, even from this society, this world.   In recent years, there are cries that the whole punish [wd2,2-1] process produces dilinguents [fm1,-] rather than rehabilitates them. We should be more understanding and gentle with delinquents, because we must realize that crime has its society factor, we can't put all the blame on these crinimals [fm1,-] Our main task should be guarding against crime and rehabilitating the criminals. The wide gap between the rich and the poor, the increasing oppression of economy and political [wd2,4-1] cause people's depressive feeling and rebellious mind. So in order to eliminate all the crime, we must try our best to develop a more equal [aj3,1-] more civilized society and establish a new set of system [np1,4-] which will rehabilitate these dilinguents [fm1,-] not destroy them.  (t2-9)  	The prison system is outdated. There are still many old administrative methods used in present prisons. Confinement and other physical punishments are [wd5,s-] remain in use to prevent the criminal from disobeying the rules in the prisons. Punishment is considered to be of great importance in taming the violent criminals. However, it doesn't work in most cases. The punished criminal would be well-behaved for some days and then broke [vp6,s-] the rules again. Many civilized countries have begun researching for [wd2,1-] a new method to help the prisoners to become acceptible [fm2,-] for the society. After making lots of experiments, prison officers found that to rehabilitate the criminals was the best way to deal with them.   To punish the criminals was a [np7,-1] age-old way to prevent crimes. The governors wanted to keep the people from criming [wd2,1-] by imposing cruel punishment upon criminals. The punishment was usually unbearable for normal person [np6,2-] Now, only confinement and whipping have been retained. Most of the cruel tortures have been abandoned. The prison administraters [fm2,-] had thought that punishment could help them to manage the prisoners. But they were wrong. Punishment could only cause hatred in the prisoners' mind. Many violent criminals would try to flee away. Some might take revenge after being set free and went into prison again. Some mentle-weaked [fm2,-] prisoners could not bear the pressure of confinement and committed suicide. The punishment system such as confinement could greatly distort the nature and character of the criminals, make them more barbarous and then cause more conflicts among prisoners. It is obvious that the prisoners under [wd4,s-] punishment system would be more difficult to manage.   Punishment is not so good. Can rehabilitating of prisoners really be good to them? The answer is positive. When prisoners has [vp3,2-] been taught [vp1,-s-] what kind of life is acceptible [fm2,-] by [wd4,1-2] society and what kind is not, they can behave themselves better than before. To rehabilitate them, that is, to arrange them in group [np6,3-] to work and live together in prison, teaching [vp5,s-] them how to live on their own work [sn2,s-] The prisoners can feel [cc3,-3] self-importance and self-dependence. It also can be helpful for them to find or refind [fm2,-] their self-confidence. And by learning some certain working skills, they became [vp6,s-] more capable [aj1,2-2] to compete in the society. They become useful to the society and become no longer willing to break the law. Some man [np3,1-] even be [vp9,s-] more initiative to do good deals [wd7,s-] for a better society because he understood [vp6,s-] the real meaning of life.   To rehabilitate the criminals is not only resultable [fm2,-] but also practical. Nobody is born to be [wd4,s-] criminal. People became criminals because they boke [fm1,-] the law. They did something against the society. The society will abandon them to keep its existance [fm2,-] and development. Some people become anti-society [wd2,s-] because they were [vp6,s-] not able to adapt himself [pr3,s-] to the social circumstances. If we can be kind to him and help him to rehabilitate himself, he can surely become acceptible [fm2,-] for the society. The story of the last emperor of China is a [np7,-1] outstanding example. The former emperor was a war criminal in World War II and was caught when Japan surrendered. Of cause [wd3,1-] he was thrown into prison. But the communistic officers didn't believe in the punishing way. They didn't punish him, instead, they taught him how to depend on himself. And they helped him to change by faithful persuasion. After set free, he became a normal worker and in his leisure time, he wrote a biography of the first half of his life to show people his previous parasitic life. He has been successfully rehabilitated and become a good citizen.   From the above facts, we can almost be sure that the civilized society should rehabilitate the criminals instead of punishing them, can't we?  (t2-10)   To put a criminal into the prison or even put him onto the guillotine is the traditional thought in people's minds. A man who had broken the law should be punished for [wd3,s-] his penalty. This view had been proved to be true, but now it should become [vp1, s-] that "A man who had broken the law should be rehabiliated [fm1,-] to become a good person, not be punished in a civilised society."   Why do we make this change?   In fact, the old thought are [vp3,3-] true itself, but the critical point is that time changes. And we say we should make changes in a civilised society, not all societies? That is important.   When a society is uncivilised, we must act as what the old thought says. Thus, we ought to punish the criminals. Because there was not a good surrounding [np6,s-] in the society, people did not know or just knew little about what was right and what was wrong. For not all people were rich enough, a lot of criminals appeared. They cheated or robbed or did other nasty things. They did not feel rhetorics [fm1,-] [wd7,s-] for their behaviors and even regard [vp6,s-] their notrious [fm1,-] things as horrorable [fm2,-] If there had been not [wd1,3-2] any punishments upon them, how could they repent [vp2,-1] for what they had done and how could the society keep security [cc3,1-] ? Imagine a person who did something illegal. Maybe robbery. He got a lot of money from the bank. If there was not any punishment then what could stop [vp1,5] the guy squandering his booties [cc3,2-] and how could the society prevent the people from following the man's way. So that, [wd5,s-] [sn9,s-] some punishments are necessary in the society.   But in a civilised society, things will be different. Living conditions will be good and the chances of committing crime will be reduced to a very low level. People are very well educated, they can control their behaviors. Although it is still possible for them to break the law since they are creatures at [wd3,s-] all, it is far more [aj3,2-2] less than that in a [np7,-1] uncivilised society. If a person commits crimes, how can we deal with him? Any punishment needed [sn8,s] ?   Here I have to say we should not punish this person. We should rehabiliate [fm1,-] him. As a human being, he has the rights to live and to have freedom. It is true that we can deprive him of life and freedom, but this will do no goodness [wd3,s-] to the society. Maybe people can know something through the punishment, but if we rehabiliate [fm1,-] him, which [wd4,1-2] the better? See the same person [sn2,s] If we put him into the prison, make [vp1,-3] him living with the jarler's [fm1,-] eyes watching on [wd5,1-3] him all the time, can we imagine what he will become like after his prison experience. [sn9,s-] In many cases we found that the criminals had been in prison before. It shows that [wd4,s-] prison is not a good place for criminals' sentenced lives. Another way is that we put him [pr3,d] into schools, farms or some other suitable places in order to rehabiliate [fm1,-] him, we let him know what was wrong with himself, and make him work for the society, we will get a much better result indoubtedly [fm2,-] It will also show people that a person should work for the society and not to commit [vp5,s-] crimes.   We can easily understand, [sn9,s-] to rehabiliate [fm1,-] a person is better than to punish him simply. Maybe it is very difficult. But a civilised society should do like this both for the benefit of the society's and of the person himself's.  (t2-11)  High walls, cagelike [fm2,-] cells, sweat shops, depressing solitude, [sn9,s-] these are common impressions of a prison. But what is a prison for? Does it benefit the world?   Prison had [vp6,s-s-] been invented as a tool for punishing offenders for many years. In the past, no government could keep on [wd3,s-] power without effective prisons. [wd4,s-] Prison system did have notable advantages. It is more merciful than death penalty or other inhumane punishments, and their [pr3,d] ability to separate and hold offenders gave the public a sense of security. It also made people consider the consequency [fm1,-] before they commit [vp6,s-] crimes.   The ultimate purpose of prison is to reduce crime. Is it effective? One fact is that many prison "graduates" came back. Some become more dangerous than before. Why? [wd4,s-] Prison is a place where all kinds of criminals live together. It is a wrong idea that there is no crime in a prison. On the contrary, there are not only thieves, homosexuals, prison breakers, but also gangs. There are gang leaders and sometimes paramilitary heirarchies [fm1,-] They have connection with gang members outside prison. They regard themselves as organizations fighting for justice. They show that inmates can trust each other and overwhelm the administration. There are also fightings [np5,-] between gangs. In the riots at an American Penitentiary [fm3,2-] on February 2-3, 1980, 83 inmates were killed.   Even well-kept prisons had their disadvantages. For one thing, the prison experience often further reduced the offender's capacity to live successfully in freedom. A large number of criminals are those whose education are [vp3,s-] limited and can not find jobs easily. The record of imprisonment will add to them an impression of being dangerous and deprive [vp1,-s-] all their hope of employment. On the other hand, an offender who serves a long sentence in an institutional setting may suffer culture shock when he or she is suddenly returned to the community. They found [vp6,s-] they are in [wd4,1-3] plight of not being accepted by the society. They become desperate and some take revenge on the society.   Generally, the punishment of being seperated [fm1,-] does no good to the offenders. They can learn little in the prison but to lose [vp4,s-] their work skill and be influenced by the gangs. Solitude, lack of recreation and social activity, being supervised everywhere and having no privacy, these are inhumane. Inmates may increase hatred for the whole society.   Can we control crime without prison? The only way is to rehabilitate the criminals. In some country [np3,2-] the governments have had some try. The living conditions of the inmates have been improved greatly. They have comfortable bedrooms, they have TV and telephone and can communicate with [wd4,1-2] outside world. There are also various forms of serving sentences, including probation and conditional releases, such as work release and study release. Offenders can work or study in the community. Of course, their behaviour will be reported so that the officials can know they are not doing wrong. Educational services are also offered to the inmates ranging from vocational training, basic adult skills to college courses. Knowledge of law are [vp3,s-] also served. Through working and studying the offenders may realise [fm1,-] what they have [vp6,s-] done in the past and what they should do in the future.   In a civilized society, rehabilitation service should take the place of [wd4,1-2] prison system. It may be more effective for crime prevention, but that is not enough. The most important thing is that every citizen's taking part in [wd5,s-] Everyone should take the responsibility. Only through this way can we realize a world we all dream of: a world of peace and justice, without any crime, violence or dishonesty. Let us do our best.  (t2-12)  	The prison system has been availed [vp1,s-] for a long time. It's actually the side-product of man's development process. Crime is the ever-lasting shadow of man's civilization. Where there exists social difference, there must be crime; and where there is crime, there stands [vp3,s-] prisons for criminals. But does the present prison system really do us good? Or does it prove to be able to eliminate crime in this world? As far as I'm concerned, what the prisons confer [vp1,s-] us is a worse and worse world. It's a trend that the prison system should be given up sooner or later.  	Why do we take great trouble to build special reservations for those culprits? Because we look upon them as a different kind of people who are acceptable in no place except prisons. [sn2,s-] They are separated by high walls and wire fense [fm1,-] from the out world and the so-called normal people. They wear the same clothes all yea [fm1,-] long, they have the same hair style and there [wd3,-1] names are replaced by numbers. We require them to do the same thing from day to day, which make [vp3,s-] them desperate. In their eyes, those guards are evils [wd2,s-] who treat them roughly, toughly and mercilessly. Gradually, they begin to believe that they are nothing but the bad, though most of them have good nature originally. Everyday [fm2,s-] they're suppressed by the hard dirty walls around them. They're deprived of freedom, dignity and personality. But they have to live on and their twisted soul needs some kind of ways to consume their energy. As a result, the prisons in dark become new scene [np6,s-] of crime, from where thrilling screams can be heard. The new-comers are always tortured by their roommates who meant [vp6,s-] to establish an order to [wd3,s-] their own will. Then the prisons we convented [fm1,-] into another hell [wd7,s-] where secret crimes are more thriving than the out world. It's impossible that those prison guards don't know anything about the situation. But their responsibility is to keep prisoners in, but has nothing to do with what they do at all. The worst case is that some guards are controlled by their prisoners.   We expect the culprits to be repaired [cc3,s-] in prison and to become useful people when back to the society. Unforturately [fm1,-] most of them turn even more dangerous after years of imprisonment.  	Another problem about the prison system is the number of prisons are [vp3,s-] far behind the demand. Thus, it becomes more and more difficult to manage prisons. [wd4,s-] Number of prisoners are locked densely in small space as farmers do with pigs. The prisons are no better than slums which are the hot beds of evil. To some extent, a prison is just like a tube for cultivating germs.   We human beings have lain [fm2,1-3] much less emphasis on the problems of ourselves than on the objective world. We've conqured [fm1,-] the sky, the ocean and a number of kinds of illness [np3,5-] so far. It stands to reason we are capable of overcoming ourselves, but we don't try our best. Nowadays, everything should be done quickly so we choose comparatively primitive ways to solve those complex problems such as crime, suicide and homosexual [wd2,s-] We have been accustomed to the prison system and we take it for granted. We are reluctant to waste time and money on searching for a new better way. We call ourselves civilised people but who can promise he never has a potential criminal drive? Each person is basically the same. The difference lies on [vp2,1-s-] some people grow up in a good environment while the others don't. We fortunate guys should show sympathy. [sn9,s-] Kindness and warm help to those unlucky ones. The most important is to make them feel easy, let them know what is good and what is bad. We should talk to them with hearts and souls, then their souls will be cleaned. But the present prison system has just made things go from bad to worse. We desert prisoners there and take little notice of them till they're let free years later. How can we expect those people to change themselves under so bad a condition without any help? Just a bunch of crap. The bad circulation conferred by the prisons has created more and more sins to this world. To save the world, the present prison system should be get [vp9,1-2] rid of as quickly as possible. In stead [fm2,1-] the culprits should be given proper freedom and conducted in behaviour rather than ordered. But here arises another problem. Our knowledge on man's psychology hasn't been enough to meet the need. It's a very hard task to build up non-wall "prisons", but only in this way can we heal the world.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH B2W> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (Topic2-1)  I don't think [wd4,1-2] prison system is outdated. [wd4,-3] Civilised society should also punish its criminals. And I do agree that criminals should be rehabilitated. It's not in conflict with punishment, which is a means of rehabitation [fm1,-] How to rehabilitate them? So far [wd4,1-2] prison system is the best choice, because it is a combination of punishment and rehabilitation of criminals.  Criminals should be punished, whether in [wd4,1-3] civilised society or not. It's one of the effective means to maintain equality of [wd4,1-1] society. One function of punishment is to warn the public that one can't do whatever he wants to fulfill his personal desire at a cost of others' interests or rights. Punishment makes the violent robber think twice before pulling the trigger. It gives the cold-blooded person something to ponder [vp2,-1] about while he is shaking up or serving his arsenic cocktail. It is horrifying to think that criminals can literally [wd7,-s-] get away with murder. They can't be off the hook by so-called Humility [wd7,2-] which is especially admired in [wd4,-2] civilised socity [fm1,-] People are always willing to hold liberal views at the expense of others. It's always fashionable to pose as the defender of the under-dog, so long as they [pr3,s-] personally remain unaffected. If we do not give criminals the punishment they deserve, it means that we connive [vp1,-s-] them to infringe upon others' rights by luck. It's not fair for innocent and law-abiding people. The equality of human being [np6,2-] and the justice which a civilised socity [fm1,-] is noted for would be spoiled. Criminals have to pay for their wrong doings to keep our society in regular order [cc4,1-] --- that is [sn9,s-] the second function of punishment. Whether in [wd4,1-2] civilised society or not, punishment is always a sure way to lessen the crime rate and keep our society running healthily. Only after that unbearable pains and sufferings, can criminals remember that one can not achieve their private purposes at the expense of hurting others. They have to pay for the pains they have imposed on others and show the rest of the people that our society is just.  Secondly, I don't think [wd4,1-2] prison system is out of date. It works, if it is not effective enough. So far, no better way has proved to be more workable. I insist that criminals should be rehibitated [fm1,-] especially in civilised society. The problem is how to rehabilitate them. Some suggest criminal school [np6,2-] It might be a good idea. It can provide them with basic skills to survive, to earn money through their own hands and force them to develop the habit of working. But definately [fm1,-] only [wd4,1-3] school is not enough. Everybody would rush to commit crime, anyway they can live and learn something useful all free of charge. Who can resist such profits [sn9,s-] Besides, [wd4,1-4] school is too civilised and mercy [wd2,s-] to criminals, thus cruel [wd4,1-4] and unfair for victims. My solution is to combine punishment with education. Only after ruthless pains, can they part with [wd4,s-] past and resolve to turn on [pp2,1-3] a new life. Education guarantees [vp1,-4] to teach them what is right and what is wrong. It furnishes them with skills to live on independently and honestly. We can conclude that only the combination of punishment and education is able to rehabilitate criminals and protest [wd3,s-] victims at the same time, thus lead [vp1,-4] [vp3,s-] our society operating properly.  To sum up, [wd4,-3] prison system is the best way to keep [wd4,2-2] society going regularly. It punishes as well as rehabilitates criminals, as a result, makes our society develop into more advanced civilization. (t2-2)  The prison system has existed for a long time in many countries in the world. And it has proved to be beneficial to the welfare of the people all over the world. Thus it should be preserved. The following are my reasons.  Criminals do a lot of harm to society. They are a threat to people's security, property and even life. So they deserve punishment. Just view it from the point of the victims: they suffer a great deal from what the criminals have done to them. They are hurt both physically and mentally. And their basic rights are violated by the criminals. So it is only natural to punish them. There is no reason for them to do more evil things to society and harm more innocent people. Only when they are punished for their crimes by the law, can the law and order be maintained, the rights of the victims be protected and people's life in [wd4,1-4] stable, peaceful society be ensured.  Second, it is in prison that criminals are punished and the prison system is not only practical, but also indispensible [fm2,-] According to dictionaries, prison is "a place where wrong-doers are kept locked up for crime". There, they receive their punishment: they do a lot of hard and heavy work; they are deprived of some basic rights for a period of time (according to the crime they committed); they are taught lessons of what is good and evil, and what is beautiful and ugly. Only in prison can they have the time and chance to regret [vp1,-4] for what they have done and only under such serious circumstance [np6,2-] will they examine themselves thoroughly. As a result, they can change. If there were no prison system, no criminal were punished, I think, at least two serious consequences would probably occur: one is that there would be no protection of any kind against people's loss of property and life; the other is that criminals would be more daring to do evil. In fact, in our country, the prison system proves to be practical and necessary. It has contributed a good deal to people's happiness and society's stability.  Finally, a civilized society should not only punish its criminals but also reform them. It is possible that some criminals committed crimes only out of a burst of strong emotion, such as revenge, excitement and so on. So they are not born evil and they can be reformed by education and reformation in prison. Even the worst ones can be reformed [vp1,s-] into better men if they are enlightened right. Remember, no one is faultless. What is valuable is that criminals turn over a new leaf after being reformed in prison. They are still welcomed by society.  In conclusion, I think, the prison system is not outdated at all. It remains helpful in confining criminals and reforming them. It is useful to protect people, ensure the law and stablize [fm2,-] society. I am in favor of it. 

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GW> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (t3-1)  	Some people criticsize [fm1,-] that most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They, therefore, are of little value. Being a college student myself, I am entirely against that opinion. I think, though the university degrees are theoretical, they are useful and valuable to us.  	Firstly, being theoretical doesn't mean that they are unimportant and valueless. It seems that theory has no direct relation with the practical job. But where does the theory come from? They are drawn from the real world, from people's hundreds or even thousands [wd4,s-] years of hard work, from generations' valuable experiences. Furthermore, the theory is the cream of them. It is absolutely valuable, which our ancestors left behind for us and which will save us lots of trouble on some basic [wd5,1-2] fundamental problems.  	Secondly, theoretical and practical [sn9,s-] seem to be two entirely different words, but they are not contradictory. Being theoretical doesn't mean it is not practical though sometimes we should adjust the theory a little bit to the real world which is changing all the time. Yet in most cases, the theory can be put into practice perfectly. Theory is drawn from the real world and in turn it serves the real world. And it even plays an important role in practice. The theory acts as a guidance to give us a right direction and enables us to make greater and faster progress.  	As for us college students, theory is even more important and all we learn from the books are mostly theoretical. I admit that students are all only theory-armed in school and immediately after they graduate from the college, they are not a match for the experienced worker. Maybe they even look like a fool and don't know how to manage some very simple jobs. But it's not a matter of the theory they learned from the university. It's a matter of putting the theory into the practice. Theory is definitely not to be blamed for. We can make a comparison between a college graduate and an ordinary worker. Let them do the same work. At the beginning the worker may be superior to the graduate for he has got more experience. But after a certain period, you will find that the student grasps the skill very fast and acts better and better. And it is the student who is more likely to make some improvement or invention. It's all due to the help of his theoretic aknowledge [fm1,-] gained during his school days. Because as long as he has grasped the fundamental theory, he sees the thing in a more scientific, systematic way.  	At first glance, theory may seen [fm1,-] to be abstract, empty, and profound concept [np6,4-] but you can get nowhere without it. Theory is the base on which the practice and further advance are based on [wd5,s-] It is like a golden key to the knowledge. It is also the rule which will enable us to adapt to different kinds of circumstances. And the university degree is aimed at arming us with all the useful theories, by which we can master the practical skill faster and better. So it of course prepares us for the real world. The fact that more and more working people want to go back to school to better their study is the best and the most convincing evidence that university degree is closely related to the real world and it is surely useful.  	But having mastered the theory learned from the book does not imply that you will be successful in the real world. We should also learn to put the theory into practice and let it serve the practice.  	All in all, though university degree is theorectical [fm1,-] it do [vp3, 1-] prepare students for the real world.  (t3-2)  	How should people's financial reward be assessed? Should it be evaluated according to their sex, ages, qualifications and record of service, or ranks? No, of course not, because it's unfair to do so. Then, can equalitarianism, which the Chinese people used to regard as a fair way of distributing, serve as the right resolvement [fm2,-] to this issue? The answer here is still "no". In fact, a person's financial reward should be only commensurate with their contribution to the society in which they live.  	When people's financial reward is closely commensurate with their contribution to the society, their initiatives are tapped and they will contribute even more to the society. The society, therefore, will develop much better and more quickly. Otherwise, people will lose their initiatives and the development of the society will in turn slow down. What's happened in China during the last forty years is a typical example of this rule.  	For three decades, [sn9,s-] after the foundation of the People's Replic [fm1,-] of China, equalitarianism had served as the destributing [fm1,-] principal [wd3,s-] Everybody in the same work unit got the same pay, regardless of the difference in contribution. That is what we call "eating from the big pot". In that case, however hardworking you are or however much you contribute to the society, you receive the same financial reward. Inevitably, many people then just lost their initiatives and did much less than they could. So the effeciency [fm1,-] was rather low. The agriculture was in the doldrums and the industries gave lack lustre [fm1,-] performance. What would have happened if the Chinese people had carried out the principal [wd3,s-] of assessing one's financial reward according to their contribution? There would have been a great difference, undoubtedly.  	It was not until 1978, when the Party began to launched [vp5,1-] its economic reform and opening-up policy, that equalitarianism was discarded in many places.  	The first strategy was to contract out the management of farmland to individual households, which led to the dismantling of the "people's communes". It means the farmers can get more if they work harder and produce more grain for the society. Therefore the farmers' incentive to improve their own livelihood was increased and they made great achievement in providing a solid agricultural base for the nation's economy.  	Later, around October 1984, similar incentive principles were carried out in the cities. The main theme of the urban structural reform -- the responsibility system began to play its important role. Most production enterprises were set up under their own independent auditing, their own profit and loss sheet. In turn, the workers' financial reward began to be commensurate with their contribution to the enterprises. Thus their initiatives were greatly unleashed and the effeciency [fm1,-] became higher. Ten years' achievement proves that this policy is feasible.  	After more than ten years' economic strutural [fm1,-] reform, China has gradually improved its distributing system. Yet there is still some unfairness in terms of the intellectual. Their salary is not commensurate with their abilities or contribution. For example, as teaching is not very rewarding financially, some teachers have given up teaching and gone in for some better-paid jobs. Meatures [fm1,-] must be taken to solve this problem, for without a great many good teachers, the education would lapse into failure.  	The rule applies to any society. Only when people's financial reward is commensurate with their contribution can the initiative be greatly tapped. And as a result, the society will be improved and develop greatly.  (t3-3)  	Everyone works for [wd4,s-] living. Either [aj1,-s-] teachers, doctors, workers, government officer [np6,1-] or scientists [sn2,s-] The initial tendency are [vp3,3-] all to earn a living. We do our work in the factory or laboratory or office and get salary as a reward. How much reward we get depends on the work we do. But, in fact, a person's finanial [fm1,-] reward is not always commensurate with their [pr3,s-] contribution. Some people get the reward more than their contributions. Some unlucky people get less than they should get. And the unequalness [fm1,-] often brings negative reflection to the society. 	I remember, several years ago, an [np7,-1] worker in China invented a kind of new machine. This new invention was put into use in his factory and proved that it had improved the production force greatly, so the factory's profit increased quickly and become [vp6,s-] one of the most profitable factory [np3,5-] in China. However, the poor invent [wd3,s-] the worker [sn9,s-] won only a worthless paper certificate of award and two hundreds [np6,1-] of [wd5,2-1] RMB. There was nothing [wd3,s-] change in his life he [wd4,s-] still a worker, maybe a [np7,-1] advanced worker [sn9,s-] His invention was regarded as the result of collective productive labor. However, the leader of the factory was appointed as manager of the big company because of his powerful and effective leading. It's common in China before the reform and opening policy was carried out. It depressed many workers and scientists who have strong willing of creation and invention.  	In the early years of China's reform and openning [fm2,-] to the outside world. China's rewarding system was challenged by other countries. Because in other countries, such as USA, Canada and most European countries, people own right of using their invention. Their right are [vp3,2-] protected by [wd4,s-] constitution. so [fm3,s-] a lot of Chinese scientists went abroad to sale their invention, and most of the students who [wd5,s-] studying abroad did not want to came [vp5,1-] back. This bring [vp3,1-] a serious brain drain in China.  	China had [vp6,d] already noticed the serious problem, so the government accelerate [vp3,s-] the reform knowledge [cc1,1-] Now China has changed its rewarding system greatly. A law of Patent Right has come into effect, the high award of important scientific invention the sciense [fm1,-] [cc1,-1] workers [np4,2-2] living condition have [vp3,s-] been greatly improved, and so on [wd7,s-] [sn8,s-] And this [sn9,s-] too, bring [vp3,s-] a good effect--new inventions like bamboo shoots after a spring shower, and this bring [vp3,s-] a new look in China's industry; many scientists and students come back from abroad too. All show that people's finacial [fm1,-] reward should be commensurate to their contribution to the society they live [wd4,s-] and this will make the world develop more quickly and more beautiful [wd2,s-]  (t3-4)  	Nowadays, there is a discussion on the subject that if a person's financial reward should be communicate [wd3,s-] with their [pr3,s-] distribution [wd3,s-] to the society. In my opinion, reward and distribution [wd3,s-] should be connected tightly.  	China's economy is based on the socialist concept of public ownership of the means of production and giving to each according to his work. But this is just a principle, it's often not being carried out efficiently. After Liberation, having just sailed into the uncharted waters of its socialist construction, China has [vp6,s-] so little experience that it had to break its way forward. Undoubtedly, it's not easy for such a big and backward country to develop in high speed. And furthermore, owing to some failure of China government's [cc1,1-] policies, China's economy developed very slow [wd2,s-] in the 30 years after liberation. And, people's reward, [sn9,s-] were [vp3,s-] not accrording [fm1,-] [fm2,s-2] to the distribution [wd3,s-] They shared the same salary, [sn9,s-] no matter how hard they worked. So, the initiatives of the hard-working peasants, workers were heavily impaired. This gave negative effect on our country's economic growth.  	Our experience has gave [vp9,1-] us lessons for not combine [vp4,2-] reward with distribution [wd3,s-] so, the principle of distribution according to one's work must be implemented.  	First, it help [vp3,1-] to aggravate people's private initiatives. There is a fable in China: long long ago, there was a temple in Northern China. One monk lived in it. And he must [vp6,d] walk five miles to bring back water. In order to survive, he had to and managed to do so. Several months later, another monk came to the temple. The two guy [np3,2-] both thought that the water they brought back would be shared. Then they only went to get water until it was very necessary. So, the water became very rare. Then, several months passed, the third monk came. He was also a mean guy. Then, the problem appeared, [sn9,s-] none of the monks liked to bring back water. From then on, their water supply was nearly cut. At last, none of them can [vp6,d] stand that anymore, they fled from the temple one after another. That's just the result of failure to link reward with distribution [wd3,d] So, in order to inspire [vp1,s-] up [wd5,1-1] people's sense of responsibility and their initiatives, we should gave [vp9,1-] more reward to the people who had larger [cc4,-1] distribution [wd3,d] to the society, and reduce the offer to the guys who are lazy and unsuitable for their jobs.  	Second, with the development of China's market economy, the [np7,-] competitions, [sn9,s-s-] become tenser and tenser. And it need [vp3,1-] a suitable system of distribution to meet. To get more salary, one must try his best to work hard, to make more distribution [wd3,s-] to his company, to the society. And this helps to improve the production rate and makes [vp1,-7] the economy growth more efficiently and quickly.  	To add up, a person's financial reward should be communicated [wd3,s-] with their [pr3,s-] distribution [wd3,d] to the society. This is the inexorable trend of the development of our society.  (t3-5)  	Time is passing, the students of grade [fm3,3-1] 90 are gaining their degrees [cc3,2-] Bachelor of Art [wd3,2-] "All these four years are for this degree." One of them cheered with a sense of arduousness. But what they really get is just a certificate. They, actually, don't achieve more than ordinary people.  	In our society, many people pay little praise to the graduates or even look down on them, which is all due to the unrealislicness [fm1,-] of the university degrees.  	People is [vp3,1-] born to make a living. That's the real truth of the world. People who can adapt to the circumstance around is [vp3,s-] most suitable to a real world. "Do as the Roman [np6,s-] do", If you fail to do it, you will be swallowed up by the flood of the times. In this Commercialized world more and more millionaires appear without a single degree. They are the economy cultivator [np3,4-] with their flexibility [wd7,s-] Perhaps most of them begin with a peddler[sn8,s]. With the accumulating experience, they win the competition and exist in the real world. All of these can't be imagined to happen in a bookworm. So there is an old saying in China "A doctor who uses forcep [fm1,-] is less competent than a barber using scissors, and a [np7,-1] engineer who makes atomic bomb [np6,1-] is poorer than the people who sells [vp3,s-] eggs."  	However, the university, in fact, provides the students with many less practical courses. It looks like a castle built in the air, the upper part is constructed without material basis. Therefore, it is just the realm of fancy and it will not exist in real [wd2,1-] In our institute, for instant [pp2,1-] the courses, which can be applied in working in [wd5,1-1] someday, account for a very little proportion, and the students in our institute are usually prevented from practice except those who are assigned. Instead, the courses like Marxism, Linguistics, American Literature, Comprehensive Reading, ect, [fm1,-] are imposed on us. I can't see anything which can help us in our working career. Can most of us make a living on Marxism or writing essays on Linguistics or American Literature? Surely no! Also, in the field of academic study of technology most of the students will deal with many abstract subjects such as advanced mathematics or chemistry, ect. [fm1,-] But it's no doubt that most of them would never meet such sophisticated problems in daily life. After getting the degrees, there only remain bookish faces in stead of all-round ability.  	Furthermore, we can also get the answer that the university degrees are just theoretical and of little value if lack of practice, according to the principle of truth.[sn8,s] Pratice [fm1,-] is the first and only way to examine the truth. Then the experience of pratice [fm1,-] can be summed up as theory. From the above, we were shown [wd3,-] that a university short [wd3,s-] of practice will just come out with theorists, not constructors of the national economy.  	Seemingly, it's the fault of certain universities but it is actually the fault of the system of education. We are hoping for the day that the students with university degrees are also flexible and useful in the real world.  (t3-6)  	For most people, degrees are not [wd3,-1] doubt very important, either in China or abroad. Because they think that only by degrees can can [wd6,1-] a person's ability be measured. Howev [fm1,-] with the development of the situation, more and more people come to realize that it is not the case. As we know, not all the people have the opportunities to be provided with university education. Yet among those who are not university students and without degrees, there are numerous successes. They hold their own with those with degrees [wd7,s-]  	We can find thousands of such cases. Our senior revolutionary, one of the founders of the People's Republic of China, Marshall Zhu De, hadn't got a degree at all, still less any formal education. Yet, he left [cc3,-3] behind signal [cc1,-1] contributions for the Chinese people. He even wrote a lot of excellent articles. Take Abraham Lincoln for another example. He was a son of a poor farmer. But with extraordinary endeavour and hardworking, he finally got recognized and became the 16th president of the U.S. He hardly received any formal education and degrees either. From these examples, we can see that a degree can't determine one's life. Nor is it a measure for one's ability. Through continual endeavour, he may finally succeed.  	Perhaps somebody will ask, "According to what you say, do you mean knowledge is of no importance at all?" Actually I don't deny the fact that knowledge is not [wd3,-1] doubt very important, especially for today. According to LCD, however, the definition of "degree" is a title give [vp4,s-] by a university. That means, it is only a certificate for your studies and doesn't stand for your own knowledge. Knowledge is always useful. Yet, it can not only be learned from university education, but other means like self-education as well. If one has the mind to ercel [fm1,-] but can't get an opportunity for university, he may study through other ways to gain knowledge. On the other hand, for one who is already a university student, if he just wants to idle, he may learn nothing and contribute nothing to the society. There are thousands of examples for both situations. Again Abraham Lincoln. He was completely deprived of opportunity for any higher education. Before being elected as president, he entered many jobs. It was during this period of time that he managed to learn as much as he could. Then he was terted [fm1,-] most qualified by the people, not by any "degrees".   Moreover, some knowledge can't be learned [cc3,4-] from universities or schools it can't be titled by a degree, either [sn1,s-] [sn9,s-] we often get information from lots of university graduates that what they have learned in schools prove not qualified for their jobs, they have to learn more from the practice and experience from the society itself. One can't fit himself to the society if he gets only a degree.  	So, I say that a degree is just a title, it doesn't stand for one's real knowledge and ability. Not having a degree is not a shame at all. To some extend [pp2,2-] it is of little value.  (t3-7)  	It is the [np7,s-] fact that most university degrees are theoratical [fm1,-] It is natural that they are theoratical [fm1,-] because the college students need to learn these theories which are the foundation of their future achievement in their subjects. Indeed the theoratical [fm1,-] degrees can not produce any practical and visible product, and they can not bring any profit to the college student at a short time. But the degrees do have their value and I don't think they do not prepare students for the real world.  	As anybody knows, automobile [np6,s-] can not move without gasoline, fish can not live without water. And we all know that a building will collapse if it has no foundation. So the gasoline is important to automobile [np6,s-] water is important to fish, as well as [cj2,2-5] the foundation to a building. And the theory plays the same role as gasoline, water and foundation to college students. Just suppose the situation of automobile out of gasoline, fish out of water and building without foundation, you will recognize the importance of theory. It is the truth that everything in the world has its theoratical [fm1,-] basis. First of all you learn the theory, and then you get the basis [wd2,1-1] element to make any achievement. Of course it has to depend on your efforts.  	 [wd4,s-] Were well known as the father of aircraft [np6,3-] [sn9,s-] They invented the first aircraft which was heavier than the air. With simple equipments [np5,-] and little experience on [pp1,-2] this area, they spent enormous amount of time and effort in this significant work. what led to this great achievement? Of course, their wisdom and hardworking contributed it, but there is one thing which can not be ignored. That is the theory of air impetus. This theory played a great role in this significant invention. After deep studying on this theory, they drew great inspiration from thousands of experiments. And then they underwent a lot of failures and set back [fm2,1-] [np3,s-] but they still trusted the theory and still followed it. Finally they invented the first aircraft which can [vp6,s-] really fly in the air. If [wd5,-s-] without the help of the theory, could they finish [vp8,s-] that great work? No, the answer is apparent. If they didn't get the theory and didn't follow it all throughout the work, they would end up [vp8,s-] in failure just like those prior failed fellows [sn8,s]. In the history of science development, there are many good examples. Many scientists' inventions or new uncovering [wd3,s-] were given [vp7,s-] credit to the basis [wd2,2-1] theories.  	Since theory is so important, can we say our theoratical [fm1,-] university degrees are of little value? I will say no without any hesitating [wd2,-] But there are still some people who think that the theoratical [fm1,-] degrees do not prepare students for the real world. Actually the theoratical [fm1,-] degrees can not produce any profit immediately, but we can not say they do not prepare students for the real world. On the contrary, they will help students a lot in their future life. The degrees of linguistics may be the most typical theoretical degree. It seems that linguistics can do nothing with the real life. But in fact linguistics can be applied in various aspects in the real world. Such as [pp2,1-4] the aspect of computer [np6,1-] it cosly [fm1,-] connects with linguistics. An expert in computer programming must be an expert on linguistics because to deal with the computer language, he must have the knowledge of human being's language. All the computer programming is based on the theory of linguistics. So now can we say the theoratical [fm1,-] degrees do not prepare students for the real world. [sn9,s-] 	Summing up the examples mentioned above, We [fm3,s-] can get the confirmed answer that although most university degrees are theoratical [fm1,-] they do have their value and they will help students a lot in their future life.  (t3-8)  	Some people think most university degrees are valueless. Because they are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. Those people think it a waste of time spending four or more years in the university.  	But I don't think so.  	As we all know, a man gains his knowledge about the world either from his practice or from the books. Those [np9,-1] knowledge in books are actually experience summed up by our predecessors. Most of them are the cream of human's [np6,s-] practical knowledge over millions' [np4,1-1] years. That's why most of us want to go to the university for further studies. As [cj1,s-] human's [np6,s-] knowledge [wd4,s-] accumulating and renewing, that's the only way for us to learn more something advanced.  	I'm a junior student in the English Department of Guangzhon [fm1,-] Institute of Foreign Languages in China. I major in English literature. My foundation courses include linguistics, literature and writing, etc. By the end of the fourth year, I will be awarded [vp1,s-] for [wd5,3-3] a BA degree after successful final examination [np6,2-] In my opinion, this university degree is valuable to me. It moulds my temperament, train [vp3,s-] my mind and make [vp3,s-] me more perceptive--as opposed to [wd7,s-] improving my chances of getting a good job.  	Some people say that what I learn in these four years is totally of no use in work after graduation. They say the courses prepare me nothing, especially for business. Owing to the reform and open policy, China has increase [vp9,1-] its international contracts [wd3,3-4] with the outside world in politics, economy and culture. I do know little about the trade law. I do know little about the process of trade, I do know little about management and accounting, etc in business. But I know English. I know [cp1,-] fluent spoken English. I know how to write the business correspondce [fm1,-] in English. My degree will qualify [vp1,-3] me a job as an interepter [fm1,-] or a translator in the foreign trade business and other fields links [vp4,2-2] to English.  	Some people say that some university degrees present too old knowledges [np5,-] This [wd3,s-] often happens that education legs [fm1,-] behind the development of science, such as physics, chemistry and biology. Because knowledge [np6,s-] in these fields change and improve day after day based [wd7,s-] on new founds [wd3,2-] [sn2,s-] And also sometimes education falls behind the need of the society. Therefore, most of the recent changes in educational policy in China have been concerned with making it more attuned to the development of social economy. For instance, courses of international trade, Chinese-English secretary and languages such as Spanish, Indonesian and Vietnamese are offered in the past few years to coincide with the increasing need in the society.  	In a word, a university degree usually provide [vp3,4-] a chance for students for further practical learning. Every student should value his time in the university to work hard [sn8,s] He is sure to get very pleasant result from the university degree.  (t3-9)  	When I get the topic at first, I feel it is boring because it has been talked about for many times among college students. But what I feel funny is that although people never stop saying something like "university degrees are of little value", yet each year there are thousands of middle school students who try their best to enter college or university [np7,3-] Why many rich people in China, even some millionnairs [fm1,-] still spend lots of money sending their children to universities to be trained?  	Actually in many people's mind [np6,2-] university is an ideal place for a person to learn some specialized knowledge which they will use to make a living in society. Besides that, university training also means something else to them. In university young people can read all kinds of book [np3,3-] in [wd4,s-] library, which can improve their knowledge and raise their level and during [wd4,s-] university life young people meet with educated persons, and communicate with them so that their behavior and mind will also become educated [cc3,7-] and of good manners[sn8,s]. All these dispositions are all [wd5,s-] essential [aj1,-3] to prepare students for the real world. Both above two advantages of university are not available in any other places. How can people deny it?  	As to the major knowledge, some college students complain that they can not learn anything in the four years' study while many other college students actually improve their ability and knowledge during the significant four years. Why? Of course it is partly due to the difference in major courses. Students specialized [vp5,s-] in commerce, computer, foreign language [np6,4-1] etc, usually can learn much more than those majored [vp5,s-] in philosophy, history [sn9,s-] ect. [fm1,-] But it mostly depends on different people. Even students studying [wd4,2-3] same major courses [cc3,3-] will get into different standards of level. Generally speaking, whether the university degrees are theoretical or not mostly depends on yourself. If you devote yourself to your major courses, you will certainly achieve what you want. If you keep on complaining or wasting time instead of committing to your books, your knowledge, you will certainly be reduced [wd3,-] to getting nothing.  	Maybe some people will say that the courses available to college students are often not practical enough for the real world. and [fm3,s-] they contribute [wd3,s-] the failure of the study of some college students to this kind of situation. Of course any system has its own bad points. The same applies to the arrangement of the courses in university. The biggest problem on [wd3,-2] this respect in our country is the lack of practical and useful courses. These kinds of courses, especially thoses [fm1,-] related to business, finance, are popular among the college students nowadays. We all agree that they can help the college graduates play an-excedent [fm1,-] role in their future business works [np5,s-] But what we also must recognize is that basic courses are important and essential too. We can take ourselves, English major [np3,s-] as an example. If we don't take the courses, [sn9,s-] listening, oral English, pronunciation, which all seems [vp3,s-] useless in [wd4,-2] real world, how can we develope [fm1,-] ourselves in interpreting, on attending foreign experts' lessons? Or even how can we speak English with native speakers? If we can't understand native speakers' sentences or we can't make ourselves understood by them, do you think we can become a good translator, interpreter or tourist guide? Basic courses are not directly useful for the real world, but they are essential.  	In summery [fm1,-] university degrees provide you opportunities to prepare yourself for the real world. Whether you make it valuable or unvaluable [fm2,-] depends on yourself.  (t3-10)  	I am a third year English major in the Guangzhou Institute of Foreign Languages. We are now studying American Literature, linguistics, intensive reading (our main courses, selected-essays reading and discussion), Business corresponding in English, interpretation and writing, Next year there will be British Literature or culture of Britain and America, something like that. Many students complained that these courses, except Business Corresponding, were just theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world.  	It is undeniable that some students study foreign languages for the thought that they would acquire an admirable and highly-paid post in either Foreign Trade Bureau or a joint venture. Their thought is unjustibly [fm1,-] sensible. They want to satisfy their material desire for they live in a material world where everything needs money. They see around them that the income of an ordinary Chinese is relatively low, but being an [wd5,1-2] English personnel means standing in a position which connects China with outside western countries. They regard [vp1,-4] this position a step leading to a high income and an oppotunity [fm1,-] to go abroad. Their interest to learn a foreign language [wd4,s-] not based on the language itself. So they don't like Emily Dickinson and his obscure poem "A Route of Evanescence", they do not like Henry James' "the Real Thing", and neither do they think E.M. Forester's wood has anything to do with them. And they hate to draw the syntactical trees in linguistic course.  	It seems that literature and linguistics can not make money directly for the students. But it is really shortsight [fm2,-] to say so, because the true theoretical value beneath it is overlooked. Human beings' life is basically made up of two parts: material life and cultural life. [wd4,s-] Modern times people should not only be satisfied with the richness of the material wealth, but of the spiritual one. Those who are materially wealthy but without any ideology are, in a sense, mere machines or robots; though they are creating much wealth for [wd4,-1] society. Human beings themselves have made great progress while the society develops steadily and progressively. People have dropped out of the primitive society and they need more and more nourishment for their mind, for instance, to be morally, literarily [fm1,-] and artistically accomplished.  	The university theories are the most perfect, classical and sweeping ones in all and are more precious than the material wealth. They are wisdom summarized through centuries. They can help to form a correct outlook on life and to extracte [fm1,-] people from being spiritually barren, which causes collapse in a man much easier than poverty or deceases [sn8,s] So they are, beyond any doubt, for the real world. With regard to those practical knowledge, I think, we will obtain them in the real world, sooner or later, while we are practicing.  	It is not a bad thing to get a good job and earn a lot of money after graduation. But this should not be our ultimate aim, and we should not fix eyes upon our immediate interests.  	In general both theoritical [fm1,-] and practical courses are supposed to offer to the students. Four years' studying in university, after all, is not much long, so it is up to us whether or not we take the oppotunity [fm1,-] and make full use of it.  (t3-11)  	Some people think most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They, therefore, are of little value. But I don't quite agree with this opinion. On the contrary, I consider that in China, university degrees are practical and useful for every people, according to the following three reasons.  	Firstly, degrees of both old universities and the new ones can show how much one person has been educated and what he learns. Some newly- established universities or department [np6,s-] provide various of [wd5,1-2] specific courses. For example, the Southern China Constructure [fm2,-] Institute was founded just three years ago. According to the badly needs of peasonnels [fm1,-] who can manage to improve city planning rapidly, the institute has set up several departments of architecture, city planning, etc. And the students who graduate from different departments of the institute will get degrees in different subjects. These degrees prove that the students have a kind of ability in society work [cc1,-] and the students can also show their knowledge in a certain aspect. The situation in the older colleges or departments is the same. For example, after graduation, students in our department----the English Department of Guangzhou University of Foreign Languages----get the degrees as Bachelor of Art [wd3,2-] in English, which shows that we have the ability in dealing with English language, such as translation, interpretation, writing in English, etc. The two examples can give us an idea that most degrees of institutes or universities are practical, because in order to get the degrees, students must master all [wd4,1-1] knowledge which are [vp3,3-] useful for the economy [wd2,-1] development.  	The second reason to support my view is the facts showing that people who have degrees are much [aj3,s-] welcome than those who haven't in most enterprises or units. For example, if a company once hires two persons, one of whom gets a degree of Bachelor or so on, the other doesn't, the boss or the supervisor of the company often gives a more important task to the former one. This kind of things happen everywhere and every time. It is not because of so called discrimination. The real reason is that usually, [sn9,s-] one considers [vp1,-4] people who have degrees are more reliable and have much [aj3,s-] knowledge than others who have no [wd3,s-] Actually people who get degrees have solid foundation of specific knowledge with which they can deal with daily business easily, quickly and correctly. So, by some degree, we can say that university degrees are helpful for people in looking for an ideal job.  	Thirdly more and more working people are active in studying and getting a certain degree by all kinds of means. Many people are [wd5,s-] regret that they didn't get degrees when they were students. When they've got the degrees, they usually can further their career rapidly inside or outside their original enterprises or units. A friend of mine is [wd5,s-] belongs to this group of people. He graduated from a technical school at the age of 18. At that time, he had been a simple worker in a factory for 3 year [np3,1-] until one day he realized that if he wanted to develop his own career, he had better learn more and get a college degree. Then he went to the Open College. Three years later, he got plenty of specific knowledge on what he was majoring in as well as a degree. He is now one of the chief engineers of that factory.  	From the 3 points I mentioned above, we can learn that university degrees are very important and practical in one's society work [cc1,1-] At least in China, degrees are of [wd4,s-] great value that everyone wants to get one.  (t3-12)  	What appears firstly at this page is some people's opinion about university degrees. After reading it, I should say I can't join this group of people, for my opinion is quite different from theirs. I think that university degrees are of great help, both to the individual and the society.  	A university degree is a kind of attraction or motivation of education, and it can help one to be more educated. It is a rather long way to get a university degree. Generally in China, a student should spend 6 years in primary school and another 6 ones in middle school before he can be enrolled by a college. Even after he luckily has a chance to further his education in a college, it should take him 4 years of full-time study to reach the door of degrees. Even then, he is still incapable [aj1,-2] to open the door unless he passes all the final exams. During this long-term struggle, a student does or has to study relatively hard. And this, to a certain extend [pp2,3-] brings him into the wide field of knowledge. He practices reading and thinking a lot, which is a good way to train a person's mind. When finally he gets a degree, he also turns out a perceptive and well cultured [wd3,s-] man.  	Maybe some people will argue that a university degree can only bring about bookish [wd2,1-] for the degree is rather theoretical than pratical [fm1,-] I don't think things will be so bad. Students may be less experienced because they have not many chances to take a social practice, say, a job, during their school life, which is very typical in China. But this is not the degrees' fault. Furthermore, though a degree might somewhat appears [vp9,2-] theoretical, actually it values [vp1,s-] beyond this. The most important point is that, the long pocessing [fm1,-] of reading and thinking in studies enhance [vp3,s-] a person's ability to analyze and deal with various problems in real world[np7,2-]. And their specialized knowledge and ability will also be of great help when coming to work.  	We all see that thousands of students with diffent [fm1,-] degrees graduat [fm1,-] from universities in China and join the working army. They show their intellegence [fm1,-] in work and several years or so later, they usually occupy or manage some important and modern subjects. Their university education does provide [vp1,-3] them solid basis for self-development. And they gradually become the country's effective strength [cc4,1-]to achieve economic development. Nowadays, China still has not enough university graduates according to its huge population. And this, in a sense, reduces the speed of economic development. We should encourage the students to get university degrees, to learn more wide [aj3,1-] range of knowledge [cc3,5-] so that [wd4,s-] can be more capable to [wd3,3-] the construction of modernization.  	We can also discover that it will be easier for the country to choose the right person for work when he has a degree. The degree can show his speciality [fm1,-] and somehow also show his intellegence [fm1,-] This can help to resolve the problem of using the persons ineffectively.  	So after this, when you hear this question --- "Are university degrees really of little value?" What [sn8,s-] you are [wd1,s-] going to answer? I hope the answer is "NO".  (t3-13)  	One can imagine how proud a student is the moment he holds his university degree certification after four-year's university study. But immediately when he leaves the romantic campus and enters the real world, he might be shocked at it. A depressing shadow comes upon him. He come [vp3,1-] to realize that his university degree does not bring him a bright prospect, but an upset reality. He is dejected and thinks that the university degree is of little value. Currently the topic that university degrees are practical and value [wd2,s-] or not has caused a heated debate in our society. In my opinion, I think [wd5,s-] nowadays in China university degrees are in a sense theoretical and do not prepare students for the world, they are still radiant with value. I will back my view[cc3,2-] in three aspects as following [wd3,-] :  	Firstly, some university graduates find it difficult to get suitable jobs after graduation. Most students desire to get an ideal job which enables them to put their abilities to good use. But what discourages them is that they fail to obtain satisfactory jobs, for there are rare jobs geared to their specializations or knowledge learned at university. Some graduates who have majored in financial trade finally get a job dealt [vp5,s-] with textile or aquatic products or dress designing. Others have take [vp9,1-] courses on food industry or urban construction but turn out to be a bank clerk. We can find more ridiculous examples of this sort. Two years ago a Chinese State Press criticized an absurd but serious case: A learned young man fails to get a decent job when he finishes further study abroad and [wd4,s-] back to China. It turns out that he has to earn his bread by mending shoes in the street. This commentary caused a great sensation throughout the country, especially among the generation at university. They were bewildered. They felt lost. Some of them took a pessimistic attitude toward university degrees. Actually, the situation above attributes [vp7,s-] to a number of reasons. Some relative authorities do not pay enough attention to the assignment of university graduates. On the other hand, when the receiving units select candidates, they tend to lack of [wd5,3-1] consideration of undergraduates' majors and specialization. In addition, some students [wd4,s-] aware that their potential jobs are not fit with their majors, but the attraction of high salary and favorable conditions outweighs other disadvantages. All these result in a situation that graduates have no [wd3,1-1] enough scope to have a luxury of giving full play to their talent, which is like what a Chinese proverb says: a hero with no place to display his powers.  	Secondly, although university degree can push a student into the real world, it does not qualifies [vp9,2-] [vp1,-3] him to undertake his job. This is due to the detachment of liberal arts and science education. Those who graduate from colleges of arts tend to supervise the running of an enterprise, charging [vp1,s-] with administration, finance, personnel affairs and other decision-making departments. They are responsible for working out plans and policies to manage the enterprise, which requires all-round knowledge. While those who come from university of science and engineering are likely to be engaged in machine-controlling, producing process, etc, which those supervisors and managers know little about [sn2,s-] They find it difficult to make decisions or adopt tactics to run the enterprise better. The worse thing is that some decision-makers are blind to the real condition and guide the enterprise in a wrong direction. Unlike China's universities, the counterparts in the U.S combine the education of arts and science. The students are all-round developed. After graduation, they are popularly welcome in the society, for they can pick up any job of an enterprise. Thus, they really meet the needs of society and improve the production forces of the enterprise. So we say, China's university degrees do not qualify graduates to survive in our modern society.  	What's more, the inequality of financial reward lessons university graduates' initiatives. In spite of possessing university degree certification, some graduates get lower income than those who have lower qualification or without any qualification. Especially in recent years, those who come from polytechnic shools [fm1,-] seem to be much for [wd5,1-1] more popular. They have higher income and enjoy better condition than those graduate [np3,1-] from universities. Financial reward, to some extent, is not commensurate with their contribution to their society. Some people no longer value university degree [np6,6-] and more and more people adjust their gear [cc3,2-] to polytechnic colleges.  	In a word, university degrees are now experiencing a low tide in China. Since they do not prepare student [np6,1-] for the real world, a number of people view [vp1,-3] university degrees theoretical and of little value. So it is time for the relative authorities kept [vp5,s-] a close eye on this situation, [wd4,s-] if necessary, to act up [wd7,s-] and carry out some reforms, such as restructuring the educational struture [fm1,-] and bettering the job assignment system, offering more opportunities to university graduates, so as to make full use of talent, tap their initiatives and value the university degrees in real earnest.  (t3-14)  	In China, university is always considered as the most ideal place for a student to improve his knowledge. University students are called "the pride of the Heaven", and university diploma is an entree to a decent, highly-paid job. Yet, most students find that what they learn do not prepare them for the real world, university degrees are therefore of little value to their future job after graduation. There are mainly three reasons for this.  	Firstly, in most universities, students are actually learning things that are quite out of date. Materials for teaching have been used for decades. That poses a big contrast to the quickly changing world. As we all know, the current times is characterized by the "explosion of the information". We can not always stay at the starting point reading those old or even ridiculous teaching materials. Universities should introduce new text books as well as [wd4,s-] teaching methods to be better suited [vp7,s-] the need of the society. What's more important, [sn8,s-s-] it is the methods of study that the teachers should give to the students, since there is always something new to learn.  	Secondly, what the university students learn is mostly theoretical knowledge. Students are actually isolated to [wd3,4-3] the outside world. They know how to explain something but do not [wd4,s-] how to do it. For instance, in America, it is not uncommon that a graduate with business MA can not find a job or can only do legwork. So what's the matter with them? Lacking practice is their weak points. Therefore, universities should couple theoretical knowledge with practices.  	Thirdly, university students, undoubtedly, are advanced in their knowledge of certain area. Yet, they tend to be rather poor in other aspects. For example, they are not good at public relation; they have no hard will, they can not endure hardship to survive in the keen competitions, [sn9,s-] these dooms [vp3,1-] their failure in the future. That's why we see some competent people without a university diploma can get well along with whatever gives [vp4,s-] to them. [sn9,s-] while those university graduates are at a loss with a slightly difficult situation. So, course [np6,s-] stressing the training of capabilities should be introduced in universities.  	To summarise, most university degree [np3,s-] are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. This is a serious problem facing us. Measures should be taken to change it.  (t3-15)  	Is it true that "university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world, so [sn8,s-] are therefore of little value". [sn9,s-] The answer goes without saying here. For it's universal knowledge that university education is the most essencial [fm1,-] way to improve oneself, so that one is better-prepared for the future career. It renders knowledge, helps the self-improvement of one and directs one's doings.  	The following will start with the role university degrees play in one's future career. In university, we learn well-balanced knowledge [cc3,2-] in [wd3,s-] combination of major knowledge with other necessary knowledge. For instance, a Chinese student whose major is English receives all-aspect training in English such as listening, speaking, reading and writing; at the same time he also studies Chinese, politics, computering [fm2,-] trade and literature. When he graduates, he's well-equipped [aj2,1-1] in knowledge and stands [cc3,-1] advantage [wd7,s-] for the jobs such as interpreting, translating, tourist guiding or doing business.  	A second advantage of university degrees which goes deeper than the first one [cc3,s-] is: university degrees help one's self-improvement, both in quality and capacity.  	University education trains our mind, make [vp3,s-] us more perceptive. Generally, people who receive university education have better taste than others. they [fm3,s-] are more understanding, perceptive and quick in receiption [fm1,-] as well as response. This is because university study trains their mind, gives them the way of understanding [sn9,s-] analysing and solving things. They study music, art, so they can appreciate and rate them, etc.  	Besides, university is also a small society. We communicate with others, make friends, experience something new and depend on ourselves to cope with them, which are also the ways of training one's capacity. In doing them, we become more independent and decisive and matured [wd3,s-] We learn to deal with different kinds of people, to avoid friction with others, to obtain support and to cooperate. Thus, when we graduate, we are no deskbound but are sociable and really capable persons.  	Finally, university degrees guide one's behaviour, for the theory serves as the base of one's action. The most useful thing we learn in university is the way, the method of doing things, so we can use it to direct our practice. Take some examples in China, a poor-educated [fm2,-] man may earn a [wd5,1-2] big money [np5,2-] [cc4,1-] provided [cj1,s-] a fantastic chance and no competitor, but once a well-cultivated man begins to compete [vp1,1-1] him, however fresh hand [cc4,2-2] he is, he'll win in the end. And the only reason is that he has the theory as a base.  	Of course, university degrees do have some disadvantage. Just according to the comment at the beginning of the passage, they are too theoretical to some extent, especially when universities don't pay enough attention to the contact of students with the outside world. There are examples that some university students are desk bound, with good score in study but low ability in real work. Together with those who know nothing about society except book knowledge [sn2,s-] But there's no [wd3,s-] a thing which is perfect, so [sn4,s-] are university degrees. What's more, the advantages outweigh the drawbacks.  	So in conclusion, university degrees are far opposite to "being too theoretical and having little value." They play significant role [np3,3-] in wide ranges [np6,s-] helping the student's [np6,s-] self-improvement, preparing them for future career, serving as a guide. Thus, they have great value -- the great value of university degrees, [sn9,s-] this, should be beared [fm2,-] in everyone's mind.  (t3-16)  	For a long time academic degree has been of great importance to university graduates. Students enter universities, colleges or institutes, accept 4-8 years' advanced education and finally get a degree if they qualified(y) in the graduation examination. As well as graduation certification, a certain degree is somewhat a kind of proof of a graduate's educational ground and his academic major, and it therefore will help him a lot in pursuing a proper job when he leaves school.  	But now it seems there is a problem [wd4,s-] has arosen [fm2,-] about the academic degree [sn8,s-] that is, most university degrees are not practical but rather theoritical [fm1,-] and consequently they do not prepare [vp1,2-5] students to [wd3,2-3] the real world. Then, what has caused this problem? May we find the answer in at least three reasons [sn8,s] :  	In the first ground [wd7,s-] there is a serious tendency of the aging of many degrees. A lot of degrees were set tens of years ago or even more, nothing outmoded were [vp3,2-] discarded [vp1,s-] away, nor [wd4,s-] those fresh substances added in during the passed decades. A student of mechanical engineering specialty [fm1,-] in a poly-technic college in Guangzhou said that their degree was set 30 years ago and the material they used were [vp3,s-] written 20 years ago! In that case, how can a graduate with such out-of-date degree excells [vp9,s-] in his work?  	In the second ground [wd7,s-] it is said that in modern time [wd3,2-] human beings' knowledge system renews every ten years, [sn9,s-] a great number of new discoveries, new techniques, new specialized subjects mushrooms up [wd5,1-] at every moment. But a fair number of degrees do not adopt these fresh, useful and vigorous contents, [sn9,s-] they are seemingly "rigid" and unwillingly [wd2,s-] to self-better [fm2,-] in accordance with the new development of the knowledge of the world. Therefore, it is no wonder that graduates will be at a loss what to do as they face such a quickly developing world.  	Finally, the combination of the two reasons above lead us to the ground, which is a subsequence or direct result of them. Degrees become too theoritical [fm1,-] lacking necessary experience and practice in reality. They do not prepare students to deal with the real world: "what we learned in the institute is almost of no use," said some graduates of world-trade and business specialty [fm1,-] who work in some import and export trade corporations after they left GUFL, "You have to study everything from the very beginning, your business, your techniques should come from experience." In a short [wd5,2-1] word, academic degree is too academic and can only be academics [wd2,s-]  	Aging [wd3,-] rigid and not practical, all these make university degrees seem to be of no value, [sn9,s-] perhaps its [sn9,-s-] too earlier [aj3,1-] for us to draw this conclusion, but it should be noticed that attentions must be put to the reform of the existing university degree system, [sn9,s-] if not, degrees may steadily come to its end in [wd4,1-2] near future.  (t3-17)  	To an [np7,-1] university student, an [np7,-1] university degree is very important. Because it is the final result he or she gets after their nearly twenty years' effort. But today it becomes more and more suspicious to me. I find that a degree is not a proof of a person's real ability and knowledge. It is of little value.  	Firstly, university degrees are theoretical. It is a common phenomenon that most students are too limited in their study and campus lives. They have little opportunities to go into the society and practise what they have learned. Let me take our university as an example. We are the students who are learning a foreign language. Our major is English. But there is very little chances for us to get in contact with the native speaker. In the second year of our study in college, our only class taught by a foreign teacher was cancelled. Taking [wd4,1-3] place of it is [vp6,s-] a political class, [sn9,s-] I don't know what is the use for us to study it. And in the third year our audio-visual class also got the same fate. Therefore, we must try our best to get more chances to pratise [fm1,-] our knowledge, such as [vp5,1-4] go to the English corner for practising our oral English or see movies for listening etc. But it is far from enough. There are some good chances outside such as being interpreter [np6,1-1] in the Trade Affair. But it is for some "top students", not all of us. If you want to do it, you must play truant from all classes, and you will get serious warning or punishment. That's impossible. So, the only thing we should do is to study the courses the university offers to us. Then take the examination and get the certificate. So what does the certificate really stand for? It just stands for the marks of your examination, not your real ability.  	Thus it leads to the second point I want to point out, that is, a university degree is of little value in deed. Chinese people used to adore university degree. Because in the past time university was so rare that it was very difficult for people to study in university. A university degree in those days symbolized [wd4,-2] highest education and best job. A university graduate was the most popular person in enterprises, for in people's mind he knew most and he would do best. But it is not the case today. Nowadays people prefer the students from vocational schools rather than the university students. Since vocational school students have got more professional training, they are more suitable to some job than university students. In people's eyes, university students have changed into "book-worms". They have much theory [wd2,1-1] knowledge, but have little pratical [fm1,-] experience. They engage in idle theorizing [cc4,1-] In Chinese saying, they can "fight only on paper". In a word, they are useless. Therefore, university degree [np6,2-] become [vp3,2-] valueless.  	Therefore, in reality, the most important thing is what you have really learned. A degree is nothing. Many successful businessmen and famous persons have proved this. They maybe have not entered any university, or even middle school, but they got the best knowledge from practice. Life and society are their schools. To sum up, a degree is of no value, but real knowledge is valuable.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH ZD> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (t3-1)  	Talking about future jobs, quite a lot of university students are at a loss. I often hear them complaining that most university courses and degrees are theoretical, do not prepare students for the real world, and are therefore of little value. Unlike them, I think that the major task of a university student is to lay a solid foundation and to cultivate his (her) over-all ability of analysing and solving problems. He (she) needs [vp9,1-3] not worry too much about practical skills.  	In my opinion, it is impossible for a university to give courses completely in accordance with students' demands, since jobs are specific, and greatly different from each other. Take the students from our class for example. Some of them want to be lawyers; others want to be businessmen; still others want to be foreign officials. Obviously our school can not offer so many completely different courses. In fact, most students will get some training before they are appointed [wd4,s-] a post. Still, they can improve themselves purposefully during the work. At that time, they will have to resort to their foundations and over-all ability. I believe they can pick up their job skills quickly with all these qualities, so it is not necessary for them to worry [vp1,-s-] that they are not prepared for the real world.  	Many students just indulge themselves in complaining and almost drop their major study. At the same time, they do not and can not prepare themselves for their future jobs because of their uncertainty and unawareness of "the real world's" particular requirements. In this respect, I think that the univeasity [fm1,-] should encourage the students to do part-time jobs and to give them lectures about the society, so that they can know better of the real world, set a firm goal, and make the best use of university faculties and courses to prepare them for their future jobs. The university's value lies in this.  (t3-2)  	Nowadays, most university degrees are more and more practical in order to meet the requirement of the society. Most graduates said what they had learned in universities is of great help in their later jobs.  	That is true, since the reforms have been carried out in universities. First, the degrees that were theoretical and did not prepare students for the real world have been cancelled or improved. On the other hand, many new departments appeared like bamboo-shoots after the spring rain to suit the the [wd6,1-2] economic development, such as accounting [sn9,s-] political economics, etc..  	Second, there is a reform in curriculums. Most universities provide two kinds of courses; one is optional, and the other is compulsive [wd3,s-] The optional courses are various. Students can chose [vp9,1-] them according to their own interest and the need of their major. In this way, they can enlarge the field of knowledge so that they can work more effeciently [fm1,-] in their future jobs. In compulsive [wd3,1-1] courses, those out-of-date subjects have been cut off. And more practical ones have been provided, such as computer course [np6,3-] law, ecomics [fm1,-] and other basic knowledge that the society required [vp6,s-]  	Third, most universities require students to have social practice and field work before they graduate. They have to get these necessary credits in order to attain their university degrees. In the social practice and field work, students can get some experience before they graduate. By this means, they can understand much better what the society requires them to be, so that later they can suit the society better.  	Since the universities carried out these reforms, they have provided more and more students who can work practically and effeciently [fm1,-] in the real work. At the same time, the university degrees are considered to be of great value now.  (t3-3)  	I don't agree with [wd3,s-] the statement. I think it decreases the value of university degrees and neglects the effect of higher education.  	China is a developing country, so its education standard is not so high, and fewer students can go to university comparing [vp5,s-] to [wd4,1-2] developed countries. Every year there is only one-tenth [wd4,1-3] high-school graduates can continue their further study in university [sn8,s-] So university graduates are treasures of our country, our society; the university degrees they own prove that they have specialized knowledge of their own fields which helps them contribute a lot to the society.  	Maybe someone will agree that most of what university students study is theoretical and impractical, so when the students graduates [vp3,s-] they can not apply their knowledge to practical use and meet the needs of the society. I am sure that the one who says this is not a university graduate. I think the courses students study in university are fundamental and comprehensive, though not so practical; the purpose is to help students master specialized knowledge of certain fields, such as medicine, law, foreign languages, computer, etc, as well as have a wider range of knowledge. According to many university graduates' personal experiences, they can soon adapt to the real world because they will only have to make some changes and development of the knowledge they have learned [cc3,4-] in the university according to different kinds of work, then they can work perfectly. And during the years of university, every student has a chance to do field work in the society, that is the way universities prepare their students for the real world. Moreover, through various kinds of colorful activities in university life, students develop their ability of adapting to new environment, their reaction to emergency and independent thought, which will help them achieve success and make great contribution to the society.  	Superficially, [wd4,-2] university degree is only a diploma that proves to others you've graduated from a university. But actually it has profound and lasting meaning, it is the accomplishment of your hard work, the symbol of your ability. It is certainly of great value.  (t3-4)  	As we all know, most university degrees are theoretical, such as mathematics, physics and economics. Keeping their noses to the grindstone, students spend a lot of time on the theoretical books. Most of their knowledge are [vp3,4-] got from books. Maybe they can recite a profound law to you without missing a word, but when they really deal with the problem related to it, they will be dumbfounded. What a terrible difference between the reality and the books. What's in books is fixed and tangible, but the reality always keeps changing and seems so complex to them. "Oh, my God," they maybe say to themselves, "What I have learned in the university! I'm just making great effort for a [np7,-1] unvaluable [fm2,-] degree."  	The point is that what we learn from books is absolutely valuable, but we ourselves make it unvaluable [fm2,-] for we lack practice and can't apply it well. The theory is concluded [cc3,3-] from numorous [fm1,-] facts and is the prime of human beings' study. It is abstract and profound. Once it is applied well to practice, it is the way to solve our problems, just like the key to a door; but if we just keep it in mind, it is worthless like rubbish. So only practice can turn what we've learnt valuable.  	At university, not only should we study hard, but also [sn6,s-] do some field work to broaden our horizon and apply the theory to practice. When we graduate, we will find our degrees are valuable.  (t3-5)  	There are many disadvantages in present university education, and the most conspicuous one is that most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. We can see many examples [np1,-s-] that a person who graduate [vp3,s-] from university with honors can not meet the demand of his job and is at a loss when facing realistic problems.  	Searching for the causes of this [sn3,s-] [wd4,s-] first is that what the students learn in university are not practical. They just learn from the book some written knowledge [cc3,6-] that are [vp3,s-] theoretically true but should be applied flexibly to the real situations. The students just remember the dead form of the theories written on their books without thinking how they can apply these theories to real problems. Second, professors are also the ones who should be to blame for it. All the exams that they set to the students only check out [vp1,-s-] how well the students have recited what the books say. If a student, although he has good ability to deal with real problems, has not such a good memory, he will fail in the exam. As a result of this, most students just work hard to remember what the books say in order to get good grades and have no desire or time to develop their real ability. Thirdly, because the students do not have to find truth themselves and they are given every knowledge [np5,1-] by the books and their professors, they lose the ability to observe and discover problems and then find the truth from it [pr3,s-] themselves, which leads them to be unable to think independently in the society and can not think a way to solve the problems by observing it [pr3,s-] and thinking of it [pr3,s-] carefully.  	On the whole, because of their unpracticalness [fm1,-] most university degrees are of very little value. They can not be used as the measure of a student's ability and after all, can not be laid too much emphasis on.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH B2W> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (Topic3-1)  I'd like to tell a story first. A young man worked very hard at school and he was a top student in his class from primary school to college. But after he graduated from college, he didn't do well in his job. Much to his surprise, many of his classmates whose academic performances in school were poorer than his did quite well in their career. Some even became very successful. The young man felt very puzzled. He just couldn't understand it.  Here is another story. A college student didn't attend classes as regularly as he should have. Instead, he missed many classes and worked for a company. Because he thought that book knowledge was useless and what he needed most was working experience. But gradually he found that his English was not good enough to express himself clearly and communicate with foreignors [fm2,-] effectively. Moreover, his knowledge of his specialty [fm1,-] was scanty and unsystematic. All these things he can get from college education. He came to realize that he must [vp9,s-] enrich his knowledge before he can [vp6,s-] do anything else. So finally, he left the company and returned to school.  From these two stories, we can see that knowledge doesn't equal [vp1,1-3] to competence and success. Knowledge is a kind of strategic power. Only when you have a good grasp of knowledge and at the same time possess relevant abilities can knowledge turn into wealth. If you only have rich book knowledge without the ability to bring it into full play in practical work, then knowledge is merely a kind of material and brain only acts as a database. So knowledge and ability are not the same thing.  Modern society is full of keen competitions [cc4,-] To meet the competitions with confidence, we are not only expected to have rich knowledge but also versatile abilities. College education plays a vital role here. Colleges and universities have the responsibility of [wd3,1-3] providing students with proper courses to enhance their knowledge and skills. They also have the responsibility of [wd3,1-3] providing opportunities for students to do field work while they are in school. In this way, students can put what they have learned from textbook [np6,1-2] into practice and get a general idea of what the real world is like. What's more, they can find out where they lag behind and in what aspects they need to improve in their future study.  In a word, colleges and universities must make sure that students obtain all the necessary information before they are presented to the real world as competent job candidates. (t3-2)  As a college student, I have come to realize the saying "University degree [np6,1-2] doesn't equal [vp1,1-3] to personal qualification [np6,2-]" To some extent, university degrees are of little value.  Generally speaking, it is better to have one univesrsity [fm1,-] degree than to have none. Because college life proides [fm1,-] a chance to learn more from books and prossors [fm1,-] It is a chance to open eye [np6,1-2] and to wide [wd2,2-2] one's horizon. College life is simpler than society life. Students needn't deal with so many people from various walks [wd4,-] So they can concentrate on studying and learning. A universiity [fm1,-] certificate is useful when applying for a position because it demonstrates the applicant's education.  But university degree [np6,1-3] itself can only vertify [fm1,-] that a student has got enough grades [wd3,-]to be conferred a degree, it doesn't show and it can't show whether the student has learned to use what he has learned. Practice is the real target of learning.  The condition in today's China is that in some universities, some practical causes [wd3,s-] haven't been opened [cc3,3-] while some monotonous causes [wd3,s-] have been opened [cc3,3-] year after year. Students have to choose other subjects which they are interested in despite of their own majors. Those "hot" and "practical" subjects, such as foreign language [np6,3-] foreigen [fm1,-] trade, finance, and management are regarded [vp1,-s-] "practical" and "useful" because they can make people more competitive and help people earn more money.  One result of this is that some students can't obtain university degree [np6,2-1] because they haven't got enough grades in their majors, contrary to this, their ability in other fields are [vp3,5-] much better. Is [fm1,-] this case, university degrees are of little value to them.  The more progressive the society is, the more competitive it becomes. Peopole [fm1,-] have to specialize in particular subject or field [np6,4-] and meanwhile have all-round knowledge. Experience accounts much in [wd3,3-2] one's ability. Experienced people are much more skillful than their collegues [fm1,-] with a university degree even though they haven't had high education. That once again proves that in some cases, a unversity [fm1,-] degree hasn't much value.  To sum up, a university degree is a premise or a good beginning, but what is more important is qualification and experience. One can't reley [fm1,-] on his university degree which is only a piece of paper and is not prepared for the real world. What he can live on is his own hands and brain. (t3-3)  Some people think that university education is of very little value, because most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. I think it is a one-sided view. In my opinion, a [wd5,-2] university education is of great necessity.  First and foremost, it prepares people for work and responsibility as good and useful citizens. The practical goal of a [wd5,1-2] university education is that of training good members of society. A [wd5,-3] university training is the great ordinary means to achieve a great but ordinary end. It aims at raising [wd4,2-4] intellectual level of society, at cultivating public spirit, at purifying the national taste, at supplying true principles to popular enthusiasm and fixed aims to popular aspiration, at giving enlargement and sobriety [wd7,s-] to the ideas of the age, at making it possible and easy to exercise political power, and at improving personal interaction in private life.  Secondly, a [wd5,1-3] university education makes it possible to learn from the experience of others in [wd4,1-4] formation of attitude [np6,2-1] towards life. Through the university education we can equip ourselves with information not only relevent [fm1,-] to life, but also to the world around us. Especially today, the society in which we live is a changing society. It is very essential for us to recieve [fm1,-] a [wd5,1-2] university education for it provides us with different techniques of various fields. The more knowledge we acquire, the better. Because we have to meet the keen competition, we ought to master as many methods of struggling as possible.  Thirdly, a [wd5,1-3] university education gives us a clear, conscious view of our own opinions and judgments, a truth in developing them, an eloquence [np5,1-] in expressing them, and a force in urging them. It teaches us to see things as they are, to go right to the point, to sort out and make clear confused thinking, to detect what is sophistical [wd3,s-] and to discard what is irrelevant.  Fourthly, it shows us how to accommodate [vp1,1-3] ourselves to others, how to reach their state of mind, how to bring before them our own, how to influence them, how to come to an understanding with them, how to tolerate and accept them. It makes us more mature, more adaptable to the changing society.  On the whole, a [wd5,1-3] university education is of great value. Through a [wd5,1-3] university education we may acquire a better understanding of society, thus we may have a better adaptation to society. It helps us to establish more harmonious human relationships. It helps us achieve contentment of mind. It helps us to creat [fm1,-] a more civilized society. (b2w-t3-4)  In almost every part of the world, the young people who have the chance to study further in the university are the proud [wd2,1-1] of their family and they are supposed to be the back bone of the country in the future. As the same, they are given a beautiful but meaningful name --- children in the ivory tower [wd7,3-]  Here, the ivory tower refers to these universities which separate us from the outer world and society. In the university, we listen to the professors [np4,2-1] instruction in our major courses. Here, we are in a joyous place where all people gets [vp3,2-] [vp1,2-3] well with each other; here, we study the theory, sometimes we can even recite it backwards fluently; here, we live, study, love, without any worries, also here, we study till midnight and finally achieve the degrees that we expect for a long time. Then, we, who are all along in the ivory tower, will step out of the glasshouse to the real world.  From this day, we, who are so proud of ourselves and so ambitious, farewell to the ivory tower. However, it is surprised [vp5,2-s-] that we go in the trouble day by day. We don't have our tuitor's [fm1,-] patient instruction any more, and we suddenly become afraid of doing anything alone; there is no scope for us to show what we have grasped in our minds --- the theoretical knowledge [fm1,-] because we are facing many efficient colleagues; we can't find our former safe, harmonious and friendly atmosphere, instead, we have to work nervously all the day, and have to face the competition among our colleagues or even our boss's mercyless [fm2,-] rebuke. Then, we may ask ourselves: "Where can we go?" We, who are just from [wd4,2-2] ivory tower, only are of so little value in the society?  At this very moment, we begin to realized [vp4,3-2] that what makes us so unable, dependent and indecisive, is our "lovely" teaching system of our "lovely" ivory tower. It seems that we only connect our ability or cleverness with our theory examination mark [cc1,3-] Therefore, many of us, [sn9,s-] though [wd5,s-] get the high degrees in our universities, but know nothing about our society and human relations. That means, we are of very little value in the real world.  There is a famous saying which goes: "Real knowlege [fm1,-] comes from practice." The theoretical knowlege [fm1,-] from books are [vp3,5-] not different from a pile of trash unless they are tested by the firsthand pratice [fm1,-] Is there any great scientific finding or event not achieved [cc3,s-] after several times' personal practice? Of course, no!  From this we see that what is urgent [aj1,1-2] to do in the university is not only to teach [cc3,-5] the young people the theoretical knowledge [fm1,-] but also to give them chance to practice what they have learned and know more about our society. That means, let them prepare to enter the real world both intellecturally [fm1,-] and psychologically. It is just like [pp1,3-2] to build a real bridge between the ivory tower and the real world, through it, our young men can have a spacious scope to show their ability and talent. (b2w-t3-5)  I'll graduate in half a year. The future is still unknown to me, but I wander [wd3,s-] whether I can be competent in my job at that time.  Although I have spent nearly 4 years in the university and taken many "professional courses", I suspect [vp1,1-s-] whether those courses are really useful to me. For instance, since grade [fm3,1-1] 1, I have taken many degrees [cc3,2-] about how to be a professional tour-guide, but from the first momeent [fm1,-] I entered the university, I am [vp6,s-] sure that I don't want to be a tour guide. If I can make [wd4,3-2] choice myself, I won't take any of them.  With the quick development of science and technology, human society is developing with a great speed, but no matter what happens in the out world [wd7,2-] in university, the students are still taking the same degrees for years and years. If they want to pass the examinations and get the Bachelor's degree, they have no choice but follow the teachers' directories [wd3,s-]  Nowdays [fm1,-] most university students know what they want to do and what they should learn. As different students have different interests and aspirations, they should have the right to choose the degrees valuable to themselves.  In fact some courses are not only useless to students but also wasting their time. They go to the classroom, but everybody is doing his own business. Nobody paying [vp4,s-] any attention to what the teacher is speaking. They go to the calss [fm1,-] only because the teacher will call the roll. It is also a pity to the teacher --- for many years, he is still teaching what he had learnt from his teacher. On the contrary, many students take some other courses voluntarily, such as Business English, English for Science and Technology, Internatiol [fm1,-] Trade etc. [wd5,s-] Although they are optional courses, they are much more useful and practical than the International Politics and the Professional Tour-guide.  To prepare students for the real world, the university degrees must be not only sufficient [cc4,7-] but also efficient. University education should catch up with the development of modern technology. In modern society, people are asked to know more about how to operate and repair a machine than about why the machine can work. In accordance with this, the university degrees must be more practical than theoretical. It's impossible and unnecessary to let [vp1,-4] everybody knows why they should do their job in such a way. It's enough to let them know how they can do their job properly and efficiently.  Of course, it's impossible to ask the university education to be satisfactory to everybody, but we can make [fm4,s-] better. At least the universities can provide some more practical degrees for students and let the students themselves choose the courses they want to learn. Then, they may study [vp1,-s-] more actively than now they does [vp3,1-] (b2w-t3-6)  I can partly agree with [wd3,1-2] this opinion, because it is partly true.  It is true that the courses taught in university are rather theoratical [fm1,-] than pratical [fm1,-] but it is decided by the nature of the university education. As we all know the aim of university education is to train middle-class or high-class personnel, so it must provide enough theoretical knowledge for the students to enable them to have enough potential ability for their future development. On the other hand, it is impossible for the university to provide the absolutely practical courses because the practise [wd2,1-] is changeable. Maybe it is changing when you are learning it [pr1,d] so we should learn how to solve the [wd3,s-] problem instead of learning some rigid knowledge [cc3,3-] To reach this goal, studing [fm2,-] theory is very necessary. So the university should and must teach the students theoretical knowledge [cc3,3-]  The person who complain [vp3,3-] [vp1,-2] this maybe have a wrong supposition that he should and could learn every thing [fm2,3-] he need [vp3,1-] in his future job in university, it is impossible. He misundersdand [vp3,1-] the function of high education whitch [fm1,-] is to help students find [vp1,-s-] in which field they are more talented, and improve themselves in this field by providing necessary material and experts' instructions.  The fact is the most persuadable. So I explain it through an example. As a [np7,-1] undergraduate student in foreign language institute [np6,4-] I am aimed [vp1,2-3] to be trained as foreign trade or diplomatical [fm1,-] personnel. To achieve this goal, we must master [cc3,-6] English, interpretation and translation, international trade and diplomatic knowledge, and so on. It is impossible to study every thing and to decide what I will do in university, so what we could do is just to study [cc3,-5] some basic and theoretical knowledge. Firstly it could help us find our true interest and ability. Secondly it could help the teachers to justify [cc3,-4] our ability and personality. Then we could choose our future job and study hard in some special fields. But in fact most pratical [fm1,-] knowledge we must study [cc3,5-] from practise [wd2,1-] What the university can do is to provide reference material and teachers' instructions 0,2-]  The improvement the university can do [cc3,5-] is to invite more exprts [fm1,-] to give more lectures to make the students keep up with the development. It also could set up flexible system [np6,3-] to allow [vp1,-2] students have enough chances to choose the courses they like and need. It also can offer opportunities to students to do practical work [wd4,s-] to use their knowledge and improve their ability. University [np6,-1] should be aimed [vp2,3-2] to improve people's intelligence of solving problems not to push [cc3,-1] knowledge into their head.  All in all, we should put ourselves and university education into a right position, stop complaining and do some useful work. In this way, we could really achieve something. 

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GW> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (t4-1)  	I agree that a man's [np3,7] financial reward should be commensurate with their contribution to the society they live in. But I have to admit this ideal will never be achieved in a strict sense. This truth serve [vp3,2-] only as a dynamic to the development of the society you live in. 	 	In a capitalist society, everything is connected with money. People work very hard for a high salary. But you can still see financial unequality [fm2,-] discriminations, depression everywhere. So in perspective, this statement is a political term politicians tend to use very often, though they can never keep their promises. The capitalist system provides loopholes for profiteering, corruption, and many other shady practices. But some unreasonable financial rewards are well protected. So under such systems, such political ideal is just like a pie in the sky.  	In a socialist society things are quite different. But at present, we still have many difficulties to overcome. So the government advocates that the people should contribute to the society with less expectation of a luxury life. A carder [fm1,-] of the CPC called Jiao Yulu set a good example for us. And his good deeds are wide-spread all over the country. This great person devoted himself to a poor village in Henan Province all his life. He served the people with his heart and soul and was [np3,6-]finally credited with the title of "excellent CPC members " after he died of cancer due to overwork. In consideration of his contribution, Mr Jiao should be a millionaire. But actually he did not get any tangible rewards. What cropped [wd7,s-] him up was a kind of noble spirit [wd7,s-] Now the government are urging people to contribute more to the society by both incentives and spiritual encouragements. Both methods seem to work in China. But you can't equate contribution with every fen of RMB. Otherwise, you'll be disappointed. 	 	There may be twilight in the communist society. In that society, you get whatever you want. Everybody is equal. But can their contribution possibly be equal? I suppose not.  	So in conclusion, it's very difficult to realize the foresaid ideal. And to some extent, that's impossible.  (t4-2)	  	No one, I'm afraid, will not agree that a person's [np3,7] financial reward should be commensurate with their contribution to the society they live in. It has also long been advocated by the government. In our constitution a stipulation says that financial reward is distributed according to one's contribution to the society, and more contribution, more reward received.  	Putting an equal sign between financial reward and contribution is natural and necessary. Spitually [fm1,-] it acknowledges one's contribution and shows respect to one's work. One sees his own value through financial reward. So financial reward is not only a matter of money, but also a symbol of approval and acknowledgement of one's painstaking achievement, which will encourage people, no matter whether they have made contribution to the society and received financial reward or not, to work harder to make as much contribution as they can. Materially, financial reward is a kind of compensation for the price that an achievers [np3,1-] has paid. Most successful contributor [np3,2-1] can never become successful without the cost of time, money, energy, and even health.  	However, what if people do not receive suitable financial reward for their contribution, or receive less than they deserve? The consequence, I believe, will be rather serious. Firstly, to an individual, it will hurt his passion for work and dampen his enthusiasm. When one's contribution is not acknowledged properly, one may have a strong sense of unfairness. And then some may sink into idleness, having no desire to make any advance. It is certainly more comfortable to be idle than to work hard. But those who are ambitious and capable may fall into anguish because they find no place to fully exert their energy and competence. As a result, their work will be affected, and they may even resort to going abroad to find their right position. Secondly, to the society, it will hinder the society's progress. Since man is the essential element of the society, the society will never make any progress with no human initiative. When people are too depressed to put themselves into full play, the speed of the development of the whole society will undoubtedly slow down. It does no good to anybody. On the other hand, "brain drain" will also greatly affect the society, esp [fm1,-] the present Chinese society. China needs a large number of professionals to help construct her.  	Associating financial reward with the contribution to the society is a necessary measure to enhance the confidence and the fervour of making contribution. Although it has not been implemented very smoothly, more and more leaders have come to [wd4,2-2] realization of its importance and necessity. I believe, it will soon go to every corner of the society.  (t4-3)  	People often take the financial reward as the way of measuring one's contribution to the society he lives in. Sometimes it is correct and accurate, but sometimes it is not. In a [np7,-1] equal society a man or woman's [np3,s-] financial reward should be commesurate [fm1,-] with their contributes [wd2,1-] to the society they live in. Unfortunately in most cases they [wd7,s-] are not.  	Before the reform our government advocated that poverty was the most praised. So people tried their best to be poor. Financial reword [wd3,1-1] was a shame to be mentioned. Under [wd3,-2] this situation, the development of our society was very slow. After the reform, the government encourages people to be rich and the value of market economy is widely accepted. Financial reward, [sn9,s-] now has become a means of stimulating people's initiative. During the course, the inequality of people's finacial [fm1,-] status comes. Some self-employed workers are very rich in our society. But their contribution to the society, compared with that of the low-salaried teachers in schools [sn9,s-] is very minus. In this case, people's finacial [fm1,-] reward is not commensurate with their contribution to the society. One saying is very popular in China nowadays: the tea-egg sellers are richer than the atomic bomb makers.  	If all the people's finacial [fm1,-] reward is commensurate with their contribution to the society they live in, the society will be really equal and just. To achieve this, great effort is still needed.  (t4-4)  	Ever since China began its economic reform, "break equalitarianism" has been a symbolic slogan of the Chinese. Since China is just on the initial stage of socialism, the system of "distribution according to law" need [vp3,s-] to be put into practice. That is to say, a man or a woman's [np3,s-] finacial [fm1,-] reward should be commensurate with their contribution to the society they live in.  	However, nothing can be defined in absolute terms. Taking the unemployed, the old and the disabled into consideration, we may find that the notion is not necessarily applicable to each person. 	 	 	First of all, let us take a look at the unemployed people. I admit that some of them stay unemployed only because they are too lazy to take a job. But in most cases, unemployment is just an inevitable consequence of economic adjustment. Many people lose their jobs not because they are inept but because their bosses can not afford the payment of their salaries in depression. There [sn8,s-] people may have professional skills. They are willing to work in exchange for the necessities of living. But somehow the society cannot give them the chance to work. what should we do? Wait for them to starve to death? Of course that is opposite to the essence of humanity. So while they are trying their best to make a living, the Chinese government also provide them with an allowance, [sn2,s-] not in a very large amount, but enough to keep them alive. Obviously, this allowance has nothing to do with their contribution to the society, at least not in a straightforward way. But it is indispensable in modern society.  	It is the same with the old and the disabled. Old people have spent the prime of their life in dedication for [wd3,2-] the benefit of the nation, of the people and of the development of human race. When they are unable to work -- to contribute any more, can we just throw them away as we do to an old rug? Disabled people, either congenital or postnanal [fm1,-] are part of the human community. We can by no means leave them to their own devices on the pretext that they can make no or little contribution to the society.  	Therefore, both the old and the disabled can also need to be given pensions by the government. Their welfare have [vp3,s-] to be taken care of with no conditions.  	Certain measures must be taken in order to accelerate the social development, such as adopting the notion that "a man or a woman's [np3,s-] finacial [fm1,-] reward should be commensurate with their contribution to the society". Nevertheless, a few exceptions must be made so as to make the world more enjoyable to live in.  (t4-5)  	Every year, various newspapers compete to grab the first-hand information about the ranking of the richest persons in the world, and people are eager to devour the gossips about the lastest [wd3,s-] billionaire. People seldom, however, try to link their income with their contribution to the society. Because if they did, they would probably find themselves trapped in a contradiction. Most of the rich persons fall into the catagories [fm1,-] of famous entertainers such as Michael Jackson, well-known sports figures such as Carl Lewis or heads of state such as Queen Elizerbath II, whose financial reward can not always [wd4,s-] commensurate with their contribution to the society. Does a responsible primary school teacher, who cultivates thousands of brilliant professionals year after year [sn9,s-] [wd4,s-] less to the society than a rock singer? Does a medical researcher who discovers the remedy for some fatal diseases do less good to his people than a queen? "No' is the definite answer and it leads us to an unfair fact and a sensible judgement --- one's financial reward should [wd4,s-] commensurate with his or her contribution to the society.  	The reason for this is that as individuals we belong to the society at the same time, and the society's well-being means the individual's well being while the individual's benefit does not always correspond with the society's benefit. Therefore we cannot evaluate one's financial reward only according to his or her personal ability, reputation and diploma and so on. An eloquent salesperson may be good at persuading farmers to buy his excessively indense [fm1,-] chemical fertilizer and thus well paid, but the more he sells, the more vegetables are poisoned and more people's health are [vp3,s-] threatened. In this case, his personal ability collide [vp3,s-] with the society's well-being. Instead he should be responsible for his selfishness instead of receiving light salary. This example shows us that linking one's financial reward only with his or her ability is too one-sided. 	 	In addition, financial reward tied up with one's contribution also serves as a booster to tap one's initiative. Scientists, researchers, teachers and doctors who contribute a great deal to people's convenience, education and health used to be badly paid in China. Consequently a vicious circle followed -- many of them quit their job and engage themselves in business which often brings a favorable return, and some fields become vacuum. Though economy thrives without advanced science and education, the country can only move forward awkwardly, just like a lamb duck waddling. Fortunately, the discrapancy [fm1,-] between reward and contribution has been realized by government. Large funds have been allocated to award the teachers and scientists who have made great contributions in their field. Salaries are increased and living condition improved. So far, the policy of connecting financial reward with contribution has been functioning well; more and more research fruits have been produced out [wd5,3-] and education level [wd4,s-] zoomed.  	In a word, regarding its necessity and favorable function in a society, the practice of linking financial reward with contribution should be wildly [wd3,s-] adopted.  (t4-6)  	In my opinion, a man or woman's [np3,s-] financial reward should be commensurate with their contribution to the society they live in. My reasons are as follows:  	First of all, men are born equal. So every individual should enjoy the same rights. In addition, constitutions of all independent countries in the world write that every citizen is equal and possess [vp3,s-] the same rights from social [wd2,1-1] to financial [wd2,1-] regardless of sex, age, minority [sn6,4-2] religion, etc. As a result, the current situation of unequal financial reward to woman compared with man is, in a sense, against constitutions, though the situation exist [vp3,s-] and will exist, for a period of time [wd7,s-] Since anything against law should be abolished, so is the situation.  	Secondly, although years ago, women vigorously launched a Liberation Movement which called for equal rights as men [pp1,1-] the situation has just changed a little. In some areas women are still inferior to men. It is especially evident in terms of financial reward. What's more, this phenomenon is quite common worldwide. Even in the United States the so-called most democratic country in the world, there exist [vp3,1-3] the similar phenomenon. Let's look at the cinema industry in the U.S. Supposing Judia Foster and Kevin Corsner both play a leading role in a film, Julia Foster will at last received [vp9,3-] less money than Kevin Corsner, although they are both top performers in the U.S and both enjoy an international reputation. According to a survey, the most excellent actress in America earns no more than 8 million dollars for each film, while the toppest [aj3,1-] actor earns 10 or even 15 million dollars. No wonder there are signs of protests by actresses in America. For my part, it's unavoidable. Finance gets the upper hand over other things. If women's financial positions were not changed, they [sn8,s-] would be another movement one day, not just protests.  	In a nutshell, a man or a woman [np3,s-] should get equal pays if they make the same contribution to the society they live in.  (t4-7)  	In the past, especially the thirty years after liberation, most Chinese are [vp6,s-] satisfied with and encaged [fm1,-] by the socialist policy which emphasizes [vp1,2-4] on the equal right of every Chinese. And the concept of equality has been narrowed to the meaning that "under the socialist government, everybody get [vp3,s-] equal amount of property and food, so nobody may be richer and nobody may be poorer, and of course, you won't be left hungry when others have got seafood.". That misunderstanding of the socialism has caused a lot of troubles in our works [np5,s-] The communities in 1950s and the system of Daguofan which means everyone gets equal amount of rice and payment are just the result of it.  	The Chinese were [wd5,2-2] benefit from the equal policy [wd7,2-] a lot at the beginning. Awearing [fm2,-] that they are [vp6,s-] the masters of the country [sn3,s-] the initiative of the people, no matter workers or peasants or intellectuals, were aroused. We have achieved a fast development in the ten years after liberation. But, that benefit did not last long. When the people knew that they could get the payment and food as well if they did not work so hard [sn2,s-] As a result, the production of factories, the output of the agriculture were slowed down. The situation became worse and worse. And finally, the economy and education of our country went backward and were left faraway [cc5,1-] from the advanced countries.  	Since the reform was carried out at the end of 1970's, an important task confronted [vp4,s-] the Chinese was to change some of their traditional ideas. When the open policy is adopted, it means less guarantee and more competement [fm2,-] One has to throw away the habbit [fm1,-] to rely on someone else and do his best to earn his life [cc3,2-] The change is a break, and it is cruel as well as hopeful. It brings fresh air into the rigid way of thinking and producing.  	In the past, when a person who invented a useful machine or had special contribute [wd2,2-3] to the society was rewarded by his unit or the government, the rewarding money would be devided [fm2,-] to many, sometimes hundreds of, portions. Everybody around him, his officers, his colleagues, even the doorman of his unit would get a portion. If he didn't do that, others would get angry and said [vp9,s-] "How could you do your work well without us?" That's the psychology produced by the misunderstanding which I have mentioned. Only when everybody get his share, could their psychology be balanced. So, that's the problem. The one who did [cc3,-2] real contribution couldn't get outstanding reward. They would ask themselves: "what do I do it for? What's the difference between me and other ones?" So, he would stop working hard and begin to become lazy.  	This phenomenon should be cleared out by the reform. A man/woman's rewards should be commensurate with their contribution to the society they live in. The one who has made contributions usually spent a lot of time and energy on his work, and it is reasonable for him to get tangible reward. The one who has no contribution should be left out, and when he has got a better realization of the situation, he will do his best. The reward to others will stipulate his iniatives [fm1,-] And the one who has got rewards will work even harder and make more contributions. As a result, the initiative of the whole society will be aroused, and of course, the society will be advanced.  	The reform calls for everybody's contribution, [sn9,s] it is everybody's responsibility. On the other hand, the reward to the one should be commensurate with his contribution.  (t4-8)  	Different people hold different opinions on what should be the criterion for a person's financial reward. Since there is not a unified standard actually applied by the whole society, the disparity of people's financial income is big. In my opinion, a man or a woman should be rewarded according to his or her contribution to the society they live in.  	Regardless of the difference of sex, people should get their pay in terms of their performance in job [np6,1-] If a woman does much better in her work than a man, she should be raised to a higher position and enjoy higher salary. This principle not only provides [vp1,-6] men and women the equal chance to give free rein [np6,2-3] to their gift, but also offers the objective judgements of people's contribution to the society.  	To commensurate [wd2,1-4] a person's financial reward with their [pr3,s-] contribution to the society is effective in tapping people initiatives and pushing the society forward. This idea has been adopted by many factories in their activity of production. A piece-work system is prevailing among many industrial enterprises. For example, a worker in a shoe factory gets his pay according to how many pairs of shoes he makes in a unit of his working time. The more he makes the more money he gains. So a worker gets what he should get. In order to earn more money, he will try to raise his work efficiency, thus the factory wons [fm2,-] higher productivity. On the contrary, if we pay every worker the same amount of money no matter he works hard or idly, the workers will lose interest in competition. Because their work performance never affect [vp3,4-2] their income [sn2,s-]  	The existing payment system does not accurately reflect the contribution that people of different occupation make to the society. A lot of people tend to take up a comfortable profession with high pay. Many young people would rather run a beauty parlor than be a teacher. Because the work in beauty parlor [np6,2-] is much more relaxing and the income in a few hours is even higher than a teacher's income of a month [sn2,s-] Teacher [wd3,s-] is among the professions that gain considerably low income. The function of teacher [np6,3-3] has not received deserving attention. Comparing the importance of a hair-dresser and a teacher, we can say the latter makes a greater contribution to a country. But the present situation has restricted education from progressing more rapidly. The similar condition also exists in many other occupations, which has seriously affected the development of our society.  	In general, the payment system is an important lever to make a balanced development of the modern society. Only when people's initiatives are fully utilized can the society stride ahead smoothly. And the idea of commensurating [fm2,-] a man or a woman's [np3,s-] financial income with their contribution to the society they live in is the most adaptable to the situations of the modern society.  (t4-9)  	In this world of modern time [np6,6-] everything seems to be going along the line of fairness and equality, which has developed [vp1,-5] itself into a human goal. Nevertheless, the idea that there is no absolute equality is not to be wholly ignored: it should, to all intents and purposes, be taken into consideration especially when social phenomena are under inspection, such as in the case of the relations between financial reward to a person and his or her contribution to the society.  	Human beings live gregariously in the society and continuously do something good for it. That something done is called contribution. It renders the society advances [wd7,s-] Human society is thus wheeled on by unremitting efforts. In the fields of science and technology, history witnessed spaceships visiting planets outside the globe, rockets whizzing into outerspace [fm1,-] and robots making a good team with mankind. In view of our daily life, no one will be blind to an ever developing society, a flourishing economy, a better enjoyment of life. All these are known as human contributions.  	That gives receives. That gives more receives more. This is not an unacceptable rule--a rule of distribution, a rule of reward. A worker finishing his task ahead of time should gain more than the other [wd3,s-] who always lag [vp3,s-] behind. Here reward is narrowed down to financial reward, which is a direct and dear measurement of work done. People from all walks of life are making contributions to the society and financial reward is the most tangible one that counts -- just to neglect at the moment the high ideals and keep to the basic practical necessity of man in society.  	Regretably [fm2,-] the idea that a person's financial reward should be commensurate with his or her contribution to the society has not been formulated. There is great unbalance. For instance, a middle school teacher gets 600 yuan a month--that is a pretty high pay actually and he feels at the top of the world. But if he knows that the owner of the small shop near the school earns a lovely 400 yuan within half a month, he will surely feel himself a joke a life [wd7,5-] There is definitely no involvement of occupational discrimination or personal contempt in his case, for a shopkeeper is as hard-working as a teacher, as human as a teacher. However, a shopkeeper is not thought to be of the same importance. Trade and commerce, though indispensible [fm1,-] in social economy, are not to be parallel with education with respect to long-term significance for the society. This is manifested in the state policy of "planning for the comming [fm1,-] one hundred years with education as the keynote". But that high ideal is always good wish [np6,7-] and it hardly matches with reality. In fact, unreasonable financial reward occurs to people who make unreplaceable [fm2,-] contribution to the society. Among those are teachers, scientists, historians, archaeologists, to name a few.  	Things are improving, though, which promises our society an even brighter future. The idea of commensurate [wd2,3-] reward is more and more prevailing and eagerly accepted. It was once reported that a worker rescued three people from a dangerous methane well in an accident and also saved the factory workshop from explosion. But he himself suffered serious health after-effect of pleura and lost his labor ability for the rest of his life. His heroic action made a splash in society. His spirit of sacrifice met high praise. The local government rewarded [vp1,-6] him a large sum of money, an apartment, and he was later given the title of "exemplary hero". Although the tangible reward given to the hero was not the focus of all concern, it has reflected to some extent the public stance, that is --- a person's financial reward should be commensurate with his or her contribution to the society. The understanding of this rule, the practice of more pay for more work should be brought into new light for the wellfare [fm1,-] of the human society.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH ZD> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (t4-1)   There is no doubt that a man/woman's financial reward should be equal to their [pr3,s-] contribution to the society they live in.   Since we live in a society in which commodity economy is put into practice, most of the commodities are measured by their prices which can reflect their corresponding values in the general situation. So do jobs. Most jobs are measured by the pays [np5,1-2] people can get when they take them up. The more difficult and complicated the work is, the higher pay one can get. Conversely, if one chooses a simple and easy job, he/she usually gets less reward. And also, the more contribution one does [cc3,4-] to the society, the more reward he/she should get from the society. This is one of the most principal rules of the commedity [fm1,-] society. And that's why people all over the world demand equal pay for equal work.   Equal pay for equal work is a practical criterion in our society because it can not only take strong measures against the lazy people who want to eat in the canteen the same as everyone else without labouring, but can also encourage the hard-working people to work harder in order to make more contribution to the society and get the relevant reward. Only with this criterion, can our society become more energetic and improve more quickly since it can raise people's enthusiasm to work.  However, there are many "unequal [wd2,-1] paid" phenomena in our real life. For example, a female who does the same the [wd5,2-2] job as a male may get less salary [cc3,5-] ; a scientist who works hard day and night may earn less money than a fruit pedlar [fm1,-] who is poor-educated [fm2,-] and doesn't think much of others and the society but only of himself. Only when we eliminate all these unequalities [fm2,-] can our society make much more progress than ever.  In a word, a man/woman's [np3,s-] financial reward should be commensurate with their contribution to the society they live in. This is an important rule in today's society and will still be important and indispensable in the future.  (t4-2)   There is an old Chinese saying like that [sn8, -] "Work hard to earn more". This saying still fit [vp3,s-] today's situation. Since we are still not so developed, financial reward is the main way to weigh one's contribution to our society, a man/woman's [np3,s-] financial reward should be commensurate with their contribution to the society they live in.   Everyone is one part of [wd4,s-] society, everyone has his duty to develop the society. That means that he or she should try their [pr3,s-] best to contribute to the society. How to calculate their contribution? To look at their financial reward is the best way. Because their finanical [fm1,-] reward is the return of their contribution to the society.   But what will happen if a man's/woman's [np3,s-] financial reward isn't commensurate with their contribution to the society they live in? Such as [pp1,1-4] in captalism [fm1,-] countries, those capitalists live comfortable lives though they have no contribution to the society and on the oppisition [fm1,-] those people who work hard get very poor financial reward. We say these are the society's wrong. The system of this society should be replaced by a more suitable system. If not, these unfare [fm1,-] phenomina [fm1,-] will cause revolution [np6,s-] one after another till the unfair system is destroyed. To look back to the history of human beings, you will agree with this opinion.   But to realise this principle is very difficult. Because of the weak points of human beings, people tend to want to work less and earn more. Even in more advanced socialism [wd2,1-1] coutries [fm1,-] though goverment [fm1,-] apply this principle to the whole society, there are some unfair phenomina [fm1,-] existed [vp5,s-] Of course there are many reasons to this kind of unfair thing [np6,s-] but [wd5,s-] the main reason is that. [sn9,s-] people's quality is too low to accept this principle. If they get the chance, they also want to work less and earn more.   This [wd3,s-] is true that there are some people who really don't care [vp1,-s-] their financial reward and they devote [vp1,-s-] their whole lives to contribute to their society. There are also someone [pr3,3-] who physically can't contribute to the society. But they are exceptionists [fm2,-] In a suitable and fair society, a man/women's [fm1,-] [wd7,-] financial reward should be commensurate to [wd3,1-] their [pr3,s-] contribution.  (t4-3)   "To each according to his work" is the principle of economic law of our country. It means that a man or woman's [np3,s-] financial reward should be commensurate with their contribution to the society they live in.   This principle is a denial of exploitation and oppression. Before liberation, workers worked hard for the capitalists and gained little money. Capitalists gained the surplus value and became rich without pain. And peasants worked in the field all year round, but they suffered from hunger and cold and was [vp3,s-] hard to survive while landlords had their ware-house filled with grain without leaving their house. We all know it is unfair, and we tried to break the old social pattern and established [wd4,-2] new one. Because to make people live in a fair world is everyone's ideal.   To bring everyone's initiative into labour is also an important role the principle plays. We had the experience that equalitarianism brought us. No matter how hard one worked, he just got the same or similiar [fm1,-] reward as others. So he would like to live a leisurely and comfortable life and lost interest in working. If one finds that hard work can't gain the corresponding reward, how could he still have the enthusiasm to continue the work? The results of the equalitarianism is [vp3,4-] that the social economy remains stagnant. But if one's financial reward can be commensurate with their [pr3,s-] contribution to the society, people's enthusiasm to work will be aroused. Many people can't resist the entice [wd2,1-1] of the material life and they want to prove their ability though [wd3,s-] the reward they gain; so they try their best to become rich and make contribution to the society.   Therefore, a person's [np3,s-] financial reward should be commensurate with their contribution to the society they live in. It will benefit both our country, and the person himself or herself.  (t4-4)  	In today's society, money is still playing a very important role in our life. So with an aim at an equal world, it is no doubt that a man/woman's [np3,s-] financial reward should be commensurate with their contribution to the society they live in.  	A society's development needs the contribution of all its members. Apart from some required duties and obligations, the members should get reward for the efforts and the contribution they have made, and the reward should be given according to their contribution. Otherwise, those who contribute a lot will feel unfair and lose their initiative while those who do little will remain lazy and content. It is very harmful to a society.  	Take China as an example, during a long period of time, a system of even-distribution was functioning in almost all fields of the society. The policy-makers thought it was fair to everyone since each person could have a even share from the whole wealth. However, as a result, the society was stagnent [fm1,-] and no one wanted to make efforts since no matter what they did, how hard they had done or how much achievement they had made, they were just rewarded [vp1,s-] the same as others.  	The facts have proved that this kind of system is not effective in today's society. Since we haven't arrived at the stage of communist society, we haven't had sufficient material wealth and our minds haven't developed so far as to take labouring as a pleasure and volunteer to do anything we can do. It can not be denied that everyone wants to have their financial reward equal to their contribution. Only the "equal work, equal pay" can stimulate people to do their best. We can see since the "reform and opening policy" carried out [vp7,s-] in China, many factories, companies and other enterprises have had the employees' reward connected with their contribution, which results in the enthusiasm of workers and the thriving of the enterprise.  	Facts speak louder than eloquence. China's tortuous experience in the distribution system has given us a lesson. Therefore, as a principle, a man/ woman's [np3,s-] financial reward should be equal to their contribution to the society they live in.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH B2W> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (b2w-t4-1)  We judge a man or [wd5,1-1] woman's value by their [pr3,6-] contribution to the society and we live in a materialistic world, so their financial reward should reflect their real value to the society, which is undisputable [fm2,-] either in a socialist or capitalist country.  These days, it seems that rewards made nonsense of sense of values [wd7,6-] in society [np7,1-] Pop stars' contribution to the society is frivolous compared with a surgeon saving people's life, but [wd4,1-4] financial rewards they received [vp6,s-] are astronomical. On the contrary, the salt of the earth are usually maltreated by the society. In China, it doesn't surprise [vp1,2-3] to discover that a taxi driver can make more money than a lawyer; a professor's salary couldn't keep up with that of a shop assistant.  Of course, such kind of unfairness exerts undesirable influce [fm1,-] in [wd3,3-2] the society and bring about a great deal of after-effect. Fewer and fewer youny [fm1,-] people today acquire knowlidge [fm1,-] only for it [wd3,1-2] own sake, every course of studies must lead to a bigger wage packet. Excellent students in China will not choose teaching as their profession for the wages are unbelievably low. Thousands of school-age children in the countryside of China become drop-outs under the pressure of their short-sighted parents because they believe that it is no need for their children to receive good education. Education is not the only one seriously influenced. Poor reward is also one of the main causes of "brain drain". Highly skilled people offer their services to the highest bidder; the wealthier nations deprive their poorer neighbours of their most able [aj3,1-1] citizens.  Something must be done by national government to justify their great contributions to the society. Admittedly, not everybody is money-oriented, however, if those who make great contributions to the society couldn't get the commensurate [cc4,1-1] reward, who will work hard? Therefore, it is the government's responsibility, as well as its authority, to reward the great contributors in order to encourage them and the others to contribute more to the society.  People should get what they deserved [vp6,s-] otherwise the world is going to its doom. (b2w-t4-2)  A man or [wd5,1-1] woman's financial reward should be commensurate with their [pr3,s-] contribution to the society they live in. People are always saying that but it is not easy to take it into practice.  There are many reasons why sometimes this ideal is impractical.  The measurement on how much people contribute to the society is dubious. A teacher in a fundamental school is usually less payed [fm2,-] than a scientist researching an important subject, but who can declare one's contribution is more or less than the others?  Some contribution is not easily seen in a short period of time. For example, every year there are millions of students graduated [sn8,s-] from different levels of schools, but teachers' contribution in education is always ignored. The economy certainly can not develop to a high level in three years because the people are educated [wd7,s-] ; but how about ten years or twenty years? Japan is a developed country in economy, one of the reasons is they did well in education.  One of the big problems in China is education, that is, the government's support to education is limited and the teachers' income is comparatively low. Once a professor was reported [vp1,3-2] selling pies on a street, which should be a shock to the government. It is really a shame that a professor's income is less than a pie-seller's.  To promote economy is an important project. Every wise man should realize that education is one of the supports of this project. To our exciting [wd2,1-1] the government is now undergoing an education project --- the Hope Project. (b2w-t4-3)  "Equal pay for equal work" has been a popular slogan of people of many generations, who strive for their rights to get [wd4,s-] financial reward so as to be commensurate with their contribution to the society they live in. They fight [cc5,-1] hardly against those people who want to deprive them of equal financial rights. But some of their fights still yeild [fm1,-] no results. The world does not turn totally better for peole [fm1,-] who wish to create happy lives through their honest labour. That is why now we still firmly stick to the point: "A man or woman's financial reward should be commensurate with their [pr3,s-] contribrtion [fm1,-] to the society they live in."  It is very easy to understand this point. The concept that one should get out of what he put in [wd7,s-] has been rooted in our mind since we were only little children. Aquisition [fm1,-] and dedication are mutual conditions. Neither one can solely exist without the other. Paying commensurate [wd2,1-] with the work done should be the basic distribution policy of our society. But in term of implementation, the problem is not so simple. It involves many complicated aspects of society, more specificly [fm1,-] the complex of people's outer world and inner world.  On the one hand, it is a financial problem. We need money, we need material enjoyment. We have to relieve our hunger, quench our thirsty [wd2,2-1] and do some activity [cc3,2-] in order to live. According to Marstlaw's theory, human being's [np6,1-3] physical needs are out of his instinct. One's feeling of safety, belonging and love are all based on physical satisfaction. So one's financial position is always a sensitive stuff in our mind. We work for what we get payed [fm2,-] However, it is inevitable that some bad people want to sit on other's shoulders to enjoy the fruits planted [cc3,2-] by others.  On the other hand, it is rather a financial problem but [cj2,4-] a problem of recognition. The great psycholigist [fm1,-] William James once said: "The most earnest desire of everyone is the recognition." That is a [np7,-1] incontestable truth, especially considering the present situation that people's living standard has been greatly improved. To [pp2,-2] some extend, people's psychological needs are even stronger. Competition exist [vp3,1-] everywhere in the world. People need a fair tournament to show their strength. They strive for a stable stand point. They can be satisfied by self-esteem, esteem from others and personal self-fulfilment. If what they put [wd4,3-2] is totally payed [fm2,-] that is to say, the work they done [vp9,3-] is recognized by others.  Every day our world turn [vp3,2-] on a new look. Economy grows as fast as bamboo after spring rain. It is prosperous [cc3,2-6] to improve the way of distribution. One's financial reward should be commensurate with his contribution. That is the proper way our society run [sn8,s-] Our world is a unity of beauty and ugliness. Uphold justice, the beauty will always come and the ugliness will disappear. (b2w-t4-4)  Trough [fm1,-] the history of human society, there is a constant struggle between different classes of people. What on earth is this struggle for? To get more from the society than the others. [sn2,s] Therefore, "No pains, no gains" is no more than a proverb or an ideal goal of common people. It is not an absolute truth of human society, that is, that a man or a woman's reward should be commensurate with their [pr3,s-] contribution to the society they live in all depends on what kind of society they live in.  In [wd4,-2] primitive society, people lived on what they hunted for. Each one had to try their best to protect the community they belonged to. Here were no classes or exploitation. All the people led a simple equal life. If they didn't work, they would take the risk of starving. In fact, this results from the poor productivity. Generally, people had no desire for higher living standard. They never thought of possessing more or being richer than someone else. In brief, the social ideology of that time is [vp6,s-] equality and reliance on each other. As a result, their reward was equal to how much they contributed.  As time goes by, people can get more and more resources from the nature. Little by little, there appeared two extremes. Products went to a few people, while other major people [cc4,1-] became so poor to force themselves to be slaves [wd7,s-] Now we can see some people were at leisure all the time, living in luxury and extravagance. It's funny enough that the poor worked hard and got very little for all their pains, however, the rich paid nothing and gained what they wanted. In such society, "No pains, no gains" became an irony, or maybe it hadn't been invented at all. Anyway, at that time, a person's reward wasn't equal to the contribution he made to the society.  Nowadays, there is an ideological controversy between the Orient and the Occident. The two sides attacked each other and said their own system was perfect. Whether the capitalism or socialism is better, it doesn't matter. Developing economy is the most important thing. How is the future of the market economy in our country? Will it follow the suit of the United States or whatever? Who knows? Seeing through the distribution, we appear to live in a fair society. The more you contribute, the more you deserve. But there are a few facts that different work leads to now [wd7,s-] unfairness. For example, mental work and commercial business are rendered differently.  Acturally [fm1,-] the whole world is striving for "equal pay to equal work". All the countries learn from each other and compete with each other. Every individual person is working hard to realize his own value. The issue of reward turns into the micro-society form [fm1,-] the macro-society, that is, from the field of social productivity to the field of human ideology [wd7,s-] (b2w-t4-5)  As we all know, human beings are social being [np3,4-] People live together and make up [wd4,2-] society. Individuals and society are closely related to each other. Apart from society [sn3,s-] individuals can not survive. On the other hand, if individuals are not exist, the society will also dissapear [fm1,-] Therefore, the development of individuals depend [vp3,4-] on society. And the development of society consists of [wd4,1-3] development of individuals. In order to develop the society, a man or woman's financial reward should be commensurate with their [pr3,s-] contribution to the society they lived in.  In some country, the United States for exemple [fm1,-] if a man or woman contributes a lot to the society, he or she will get a high salary. This is good to the development of both individals [fm1,-] and society. Individuals can benefit a lot from the salary. First, the salary can meet their physical needs. If a man or woman gets a high salary, he or she will lead a comfortable life. He or she will have enough food, medical care and living necessaties [fm1,-] He or she will be healthy enough to go on working. When he or she works, he or she will not worry about their [pr3,5-] living. Second, the salary also can satisfy his or her psychological needs. The salary is a symble [fm1,-] of his or her success. What he or she has done is affirmed through the high salary that he or she gets. The worth of individuals is recognized by society. As a result, he/she will keep on working hard in their [pr3,s-] job. Hence, each individual develops themselves [pr3,3-] The more contribution individuals do [cd3,4-] the more rapidly the society develops. And of course, the more rapidly the society develops, the more rewards individuls [fm1,-] can get from the society.  Sometimes a man/woman does not get commensurate [cc4,-1] reward for what he/she has done. This will not only hurt the interest of individual [np6,2-] but also hinder the development of soiety [fm1,-] Before Chinese government practised reform policy [np6,4-] people get equal pay for unequal work. This practice hurt the initiativity [fm2,-] of people. No matter how many contribution [np3,1-] a man/woman did [cc3,4-] the level of his/her living remained low. He/she had to economized [vp5,1-] on food and clothing. As a result, no one was willing [aj1,1-3] contribute to society. And the GNP of China increased slowly during those years. However, after Chinese government reformed their policy, the initiative of [wd4,2-2] people are [vp3,4-] [vp6,s-] brought into play. To improve the living standard and get recognition of society, men/women tried their best to contribute to the society. At the same time, the GNP of China increased sharply. Hence, [wd4,-3] income of individuals increased and their living standard improved.  To sum up, to keep a man/woman's financial reward commensurate with his/her contribution is important for [wd4,1-3] society to develop.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH ZD> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (t6-1)  	Television is the opium of the masses. I don't think this is an exaggerating [aj4,1-1] saying, on the contrary, it generalizes [vp1,-s-] that how harmful television is for us. We can see the negative impact of television in daily life.  	Television, like the [wd5,s-] opium, poisons [wd4,s-] masses' mind. More and more television programs are turning out rough and slipshod work nowadays. In order to pursue profits from producing lots of programs as fast as possible [sn2,s-] TV producer [np6,s-] would put the quality aside, scrape together the rubbish contents, plots, meaningless dialogues. And in order to cater to some people's taste, they produce quite a lot [wd4,2-1] things with valgar [fm1,-] interests. So, when the audience turn on [wd4,s-] television, they will absorb the informations [np5,-] unconciously [fm1,-] especially the children and the youth, which [pr5,s-] are quite easy to be poisoned. Because they still lack of [wd3,3-1] judgment [sn2,s-] And the programs always confuse [vp1,-s-] them from judging what is wrigh [fm1,-] what is wrong. Youth just learn from what they see. Television can use [vp7,s-] to explain part of the main reason that the juvenile delingueney [fm1,-] is so universal today and has the tendency of increasing. Robbing, raping, killing, television tells a lot [wd4,1-1] stories about these [sn5,s-]  	Televison [fm1,-] is a narcotic, it kills people's time without noticing [wd3,s-] like opium. Half an hour meaningless talk shows, ten minutes commercial [np6,2-] [wd4,s-] one hour serial play, one goes [wd4,-]after another. Here, you hardly can realize that time exist [vp3,s-] And you needn't think any more, just follow the programs and let the television feed you every trivial thing and ready-made thought, no matter it is good or bad.  	Almost everyone know [vp3,s-] the result of taking opium, but not too many people take the effect of TV on the masses as serious as the [wd5,3-1] opium. Now, let's do it.  (t6-2)  	Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the end of the 20th century, he would replace religion with television. It means that television is the opium of the masses in current days.  	I think it is not correct. Religion was the opium of the masses because it made people image [wd2,s-] something unexisted [fm2,-] and they just followed the [wd5,1-1] God instead of trying their best to solve problems. However, television offers us some realities and makes our life vivid at the same time.  	First, television offers us the information of the outside world and you will know what is taking place outside now within a few minutes if you turn on TV.  	Second, television gives us pleasure and makes us relax after a whole day work. You don't need to buy tickets to go to the cinema and you can appreciate the exquisite programme at home if you turn on TV. And you can also choose what programme you like.  	Third, television supplys [fm2,-] [vp1,-s-] us convenience through [wd4,1-2] advertisement programme. You can choose daily necessities just [wd4,s-] following the ad. because you have familiarised [cc3,-2] the function and advantages of the products through the introduction of [wd4,3-1] ad. And it has also saved your time and you don't need to spend time in investigating what you should choose.  	Fourth, television can also offer us knowledge through [wd4,1-2] education programme. You don't need to spend [vp1,-5] money to take course [np6,2-1] outside.  	Fifth, television can relieve the loneliness of the old men. The old men always have a lot of spare time but nothing to do. Now, they can kill time before TV.  	To sum up, we can see that television benefits us not only in the substances [wd7,s-] but also in the spirit, It is not the opium of the masses just like the religion.  (t6-3)  	About one and a half hundred years ago, Marx said that religion was the opium of the masses. But if he was alive at the end of the 20th century, he would probably replace religion with television, since TV nowadays is playing an important role in people's daily life as religion did before. And also, although people's adoration to [wd3,1-] religion before and their commitments [np5,-] with [wd3,1-1] TV nowadays are totally different things at least, they are alike on one point: both of them can have bad influences or effects on people without people's awarenesses [np5,-] of them.  	Many of TV's adverse effects have been exposed by many people during recent years, which I do not want to repeat. But I would like to put emphasis on one of them here.  	Firstly, TV disconcentrates [fm2,-] people's attention and makes them lose their logical thinking as well as imaginations without people's ever knowing it. In order to attract every viewer, TV programmers produce a lot of programmes which have short, colorful, moving pictures. When people watch them, they just submit to what they have seen and accept what the TV programmes intend to show them. They seldom do [cc3,-2] their thinking by using their own minds. These kinds of bad effects are fatal, because as we know every [np9,-2] rewarded [aj4,s-] work in life requires concentration, determination and persistence, which one will possibly lose when he or she watch [vp3,s-] too much TV.  	Secondly, people neglect the necessity to improve themselves and their own abilities while spending so much time on TV. People who like to watch sports programmes, for example, have seldom decided to play football, basketball or other sports outside their house. What they like to do is to sit before the Television and get excited by the sports the other people play. They do not realize that they are becoming fatter, their health conditions are becoming poorer, and their eyes are becoming near-sighted. They feel it comfortable to sit there and watch, just like those opium taker who find that opium is a resource of enjoyment.  	It seems no use to discuss whether TV is good or not, because that totally depends on what kind of attitude one takes towards TV and what kind of role TV is really playing in one's life. But here I would like to give one suggestion to those people who spend so much time on TV every day, [sn9,-] that is [wd5,s-] [sn9,s-] TV should not be the "dominator" of their life, because in life they have something more important to do and something which are expecting us [wd3,s-] to contribute our effects and wisdom.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH BW> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (t6-1)  	Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. Now at the end of the 20th century, in the same sentence, "religion" is replaced by some with "television". They claim that television has poisoned and corrupted people's mind and it should be thrown out of the society right away just as opium was once destroyed by Lin Zexu around 150 years ago. These people's unpleasant feeling, or even hatred, toward television would seem to be understandable to anybody if only he has ever watch [vp9,3-] any programme either sadism or violent [wd2,3-] on TV --- which is quite available there --- and has realized what bad effect it will have on people's mind. However, I'd rather not be that quick to jump at the conclusion that TV should be totally eliminated from our society. A coin has always got two sides. There are both advantages and disadvantages of television. To my mind, the advantages of TV far outweigh the disadvantages.  	TV keeps us informed about current events and allows us to follow the latest development in science and politics. If there were no TV, the football fans who could not travel all the way to Chicago would be moaning these days since they could not see "with their own eyes" how the Germans had won Bolivians and how their Italian heroes had been defeated. Without TV, we would have to use our own mind to imagine how those excellent astronauts could possibly walk in the outer space without floating away. It may be argued that radio can do very well in supplying the latest news, but undoubtedly TV can provide something more lifelike and real. A lot of TV programmes introduce people to things they never thought of before and have never heard of before. People all around the world are no longer distant and isolated from each other. The most distant countries and the strangest customs are brought right into one's living-room. Now by pressing a button, we can see how the Eskimoes [fm2,-] manage to live in the severe cold in Alaska and what the Australian aborigines look like. The world seems smaller now and people in different countries feel closer to each other.  	TV does the job of education in the broadest sense. It provides enormous possibilities for education, like school Programmes via close-circuit television, and it provides also special broadcasts for those in TV university or open university. It offers specialized subjects like language teaching, cooking, knitting, etc. From "Follow me" to "Family Album U.S.A.", TV English teaching programmes have benefited English learners of different ages. TV series have done a great job in popularizing many literary masterpieces. Through TV, children can extend their knowledge and TV also provides vital food for their imagination.  	TV is a good company [wd3,4-] to those who don't work, e.g. housewives, lonely old people, etc. There is a considerable variety of programmes on television. They can choose whatever they want to see.  	TV is a great invention and it plays a very important part in people's life, but I've said at the beginning, there are always bright side and dark side of a thing. It also has some disadvantages. It occupies too much of people's free time. It passes on to children the corrupting values of the corrupt society. However, TV in itself is neither good nor bad. It is the uses to which it is put that determines its value to society.  (t6-2)  	TV is expected to be one of the greatest inventions in the 20th century. Nowadays, it was [vp6,s-] widely spread throughout the world. Some people regard it as the opium of the mass [wd3,5-] But in my opinion, television plays an active and important part in people's life.  	First of all, TV is a convenient way which can help people broad [wd2,s-] their minds. Television can help people keep up with the latest development on politics and science by providing [vp2,-6] them a large number of such kind of information on time. It can also offer people an opportunity to understand what other's life is like. Programs on television are various today. So people can get all kinds of information from it and their minds will be broaden [vp9,2-] Since their minds are broaden [vp9,4-] their imagination will be stimulated. There is a programm [fm1,-] named "Why didn't I think of it" on TV. It supplies [vp2,-7] people of a chance to show their little invention. Through it, many people show their inventions on TV and find they are capable. So it should be said that TV plays significant role [np6,3-2] in broading [wd2,1-2] people's minds, stimulating their imagination and evaluating themselves.  	Another thing people always use to criticize TV is that people are passive in front of TV. They receive what TV tells them and their ability of thinking is lessened. But I would like to say TV should not take the blame. People should be blamed. People become more and more lazy today. When the programm [fm1,-] finishes, they don't want to think more about the problems offered by the programm [fm1,-] On the contrary, they focus on the interesting pictures and stories on TV. If they read books with this kind of attitude, book [np6,-2] can also do nothing to help them improve their ability of thinking.  	Thirdly, TV provides [vp2,-4] people a kind of entertainment and this will do people good. Since the society is well-developed today and competition between people becomes more and more fierce, entertainment on TV has great effect on making people become well-relaxed and enjoy [vp4,-s-] the amusement is a good way for them to avoid feeling tired of life. This is helpful for them to be re-excited in the next day's work, keep their minds in balance and always love their life.  	Of course, TV has its bad influence on people. Too much time in front of TV will also be harmful to people's health. But in short, TV doesn't make people forget the reality and escape from it. On the contrary, it has done and will do many things to build close tie [np6,2-2] between people and society and it tells people that they should do sth. [fm2,-] for their society. In this sense, TV is not the opium, but the stimulant.  (t6-3)  	Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. Nowadays, some people hold that if Marx was alive at the end of the 20th century, he would replace religion with television. Then is television the opium of the masses?  	The main complaint the "anti-televisionists" [fm1,-] have is most likely to be the one that television causes people to get used to passing much time by receiving the pictures on the screen passively, which discourages imagination and creativeness. Yet this is unfair. Television is only a facility to provide a wide range of entertainment and information. How to make good use [np6,2-] of it is the matter of each independent audience. And as a matter of fact, the great majority of people are far from being so crazy about television as to glue to it day and night. In most cases, television acts as a convient [fm1,-] means to get information and relaxation in one's spare time. Never before in history had customs and events from all over the world been brought so vividly to so many families simultaneously. And it is especially important and benefitial [fm1,-] to the people in remote areas where cultural and entertainment facilities are inadequate. So many things from the outside world will surely broaden one's horizon and help to cultivate one's imagination. So how can we assume that receiving means passiveness and inactivity? More over, even if some people watch TV merely for relaxation, it is not a very serious problem since it's only a way of spending their spare time and getting relaxed from the burden of work.  	People also blame television for the assumption that it is run for profit. In fact, in this case, the programs must be as original and various as possible to attract audience from all walks of life. And the competitions among different television stations eventually lead to the progressing of both quantity and quality [cc3,7-] of TV programs. Facing this, the audience have to judge and make their own choices, which unconsciously [wd3,s-] helps to develop his ability of appreciation.  	So by weighing the advantages and disadvantages we can't say that television is the opium of the masses. On the contrary, we should make further use of it to enrich our life.  (t6-4)  	Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. Some people said that if he was alive at the end of 20th centary [fm1,-] he would replace religion with television. By saying this, they don't see the great advantage television has brought to us.  	First, television provides [vp2,-7] us a very economical and convenient way of entertainment. If you like films, you don't need to go to cinema. What you need to do is just to switch on [wd4,1-1] television at the right time, and sit in your most comfortable position, perhaps with a cup of tea or coffee. Nowadays, there is a large variety of entertaining programs on television, covering nearly all people's interests, like music, sports, etc. Everybody can find what he is interested in on television. And if the time is not suitable for you, you can use a video tape recorder to record the program you want to watch, and enjoy it at any time you like. With respect to convenience, I can see no other kind of entertainment which can be compared with [wd7,s-]  	Then, television keeps us well informed by providing a large quantity of information. Sitting before a television, people can know what has happened, or even, what is happening in the countries on the other side of the earth. And you can get almost all the information you want on television, like weather report, shopping guide, current prices of stocks, important state policies,... [sn9,s] etc. So television has brought the whole world before us, and drawn us near to the world. There is not a period in history that [pr5,s-] people are more "learned".  	Television is also a [np7,-1] efficient means of mass education. Every year, a lot of people graduate from many "open universities", which is available because of television. It is a [np7,-1] effective supplement [cc4,1-] for the nation's education program. It provides opportunities for those who can not go to the regular schools to get their formal education. This can help to improve the people's quality of a nation.  	Since television has so many advantages, we should make good use of it to serve our everyday needs. Those people who think television is the opium should remember that we are human beings, the positive element [wd7,s-] that we should use the TV instead of becoming the slaves of it.  (t6-5)  	Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. Some people think that if Marx was alive at the end of the 20th century, he would replace religion with television. Obvious [wd2,s-] these people compare television with opium. I'm afraid that I can't agree to this opinion.  	There is great difference between opium and television. Though opium is a kind of medicine, most people will think of the harm it does to people when mentioning it. For television, the situation is not the same as opium. Many people like it, no matter young or old, male or female, the reason why it's so popular among the masses is that it does have many good points.  	First of all, television is very cheap for family entertainment. People don't have to go to the movie or theatre to enjoy themselves. All they have to do is push the button, then they can see [cc3,-5] all kinds of wonderful performances and get relaxed after one day's hard work or study.  	Secondly, people can enlarge their scope of knowledge through television. Television provides a good opportunity for people to travel the whole globe, visiting the famous scenic spots and historical sites and enjoying the beautiful scenary [fm1,-] of different areas. From the little screen, they can see people of different countries, different religions, or different races, and get to know their social customs.  	Television is also a good means of education. People who cannot go to college could learn many courses through television. Now there are many educational programs on television, such as English, computer, economy. It's very convenient.  	In addition, TV can be a good company for people, especially for the old and those who have nothing to do. It can help them to pass the time and enjoy themselves.  	Of course, I don't mean that everything about TV is good, and people should watch TV all the time instead of working and studying. Each thing has two sides, the good and the bad. Even the best thing, such as tonic, if taken too much, will do harm to people. It's also the case with TV. Many people complain that TV costs them too much time and there is too much sex and violence in [wd3,5-2] TV now. I admit that these are all true. But let's think of it further, it's people who watch the TV and make the TV programs. TV itself has no fault and no one can deny that TV is one of the greatest inventions of this century. It's people who play the active role. So people should improve their quality instead of putting all faults on TV. After all, TV is only a gandget [fm1,-] people invented for entertainment. It serves for [vp2,-1] people. People should watch TV with selection and limits. Only in this way, can TV do all the good to people and bring no bad influence.  (t6-6)  	Television is the most popular source of recreation nowadays. It is convenient, as it keeps the audience well-informed of the current events all over the world without their stepping out of the sitting-room. It is also cheap comparatively while having the same quality of films [wd7,s-] Except for a few instructive and entertaining programmes, however, most television programmes are poisonous to the audience's minds.  	Television passes on to the audience the plony [fm1,-] values of the society. The major force of this effect is the numerous delicated-produced [fm2,-] TV advertisements. It is very common to find a beautiful girl beyond herself with delight only because she has just bought a Lux shampoo. It is also implied that kids will get high grades at school if they drink the "Tai Yang Shen" every morning. Though most audience doubt the majic [fm1,-] effects of the products, they would follow the trend and buy them, because familiarity breeds trust. But girls are not all as beautiful as the model in the ad thongh [fm1,-] they use the same brand of shampoo. Children are not at all that clever though they drink the same magic water. The advertisements are all false. Audience know it very well but they are willing to be deceived as it is regarded as fashion. In addition, fashion traps youth into smoking with the help of TV ads. It is shown on TV that three pretty women in black miniskirt are smoking leisurely beside a cadllae [fm1,-] in the town center with a voice saying charmingly, "You just got hold of a nice piece of America. Lucky strike (a cigarette brand) is the original...a real classic!" Adolescents time and again fail to resist the temptation and start smoking just because television tells them that smoking represents an American life style.  	Television makes the audience completely passive. Everything is presented to them without any effort on their part. All they have to do is merely press the button. Without television, people actually live happily. They go to countryside for a picnic with the family members. They do some exercises and build their own body. They visit their friends and make a nice chat [cc3,3-] With television, all they are doing after a day's work is to sit in front of a set and watching until the time for sleep. They no longer read, because it is supposed [vp1,2-8] television provides [vp1,-6] them all that is in books. They make no choice and exercise no judgement. Their mind is paralysed and they totally rely on TV, the goggle box. Some of them especially children become so addicted to television, that they often neglect the necessary and more important things like meals, sleep and even work. People take no initiative in life and they are satisfied with the television programmes, which are usually not of high quality and tend to be nothing but second hand experience. Their mind is no longer creative and active and their life is limited, centered by a machine.  	Television like opium is becoming a modern addiction and its evils can be found in our daily life. Its false values which emphasize [vp1,-4] on materialism and violence, together with its paralysing effects on the audience's minds are as dangerous and disastrous as religion of the 19th century.  (t6-7)  	Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. Some people suggest that if he was alive at the end of the 20th century, he would replace religion with television. But personally, I don't think Marx would do so. It's true that TV has some harmful effects on society, but there is not enough reason to consider it opium, which, apart from its narrow medical use as a pain killer, is almost 100 percent harmful.  	Religion is different from television and Marx is sharp in pointing out its harmful influence on people. Whatever the religion is, there is always an almighty God, the supposed Creator of the world, who controls people's fate (Scientifically, it was man who created him.) The idea is that one must first admit that life is painful and he is a sinner. If he wants salvation and an immortal soul after his life, he must show total faith and obedience to his God. Religion, like opium, is a painkiller, for it makes people accept their fate and willing to suffer. Moreover, like opium, it created hallucinations. Religious people believe that their God will save them, so they wait passively and silently. They will not take actions themselves to change their miserable life.  	Marx could not have been more correct in saying that religion was the opium of the masses. But the accusation that television is opium is not well justified, though television is not totally innocent.  	Television does have some harmful effects. Since television systems are privately owned in most countries, some television programmes are commited [fm2,-] to money-making. Television shows "popular" programmes to attract [wd4,1-1] audience by which to attract advertisements [cc3,1-]. Some programmes are not "quality" programmes and full of sex and violence. If people are exposed to these [np9,-2] social "darkness" for long hours each day, especially young children and adolescents, who do not have the ability to judge right and wrong, they might follow the examples and commit crimes. And if one is addicted to television, he will not spare his time for his hobbies, friends or even his family.  	But on the other hand we must also see that television does do people good. First, it provides entertainment. People watch football games and TV plays. They have fun and get relaxation. And there are a large number of "quality" programmes apart from those that are not. Some are really informative and instructive. One knows what is going on in his country and the other countries. He sits in his room and keeps in touch with the world. Television broadens his horizon and enriches his mind. It is also a good companion to old people who live alone.  	We can not simply brush these aside only because TV has bad influences. So long as TV produces quality programmes and one can keep himself from being addicted, it does him good rather than harm.  	As open-minded and wise as he was, Marx would criticize TV but he would not consider its role total [wd2,3-1] negtive [fm1,-] as the role of religion almost is. Religion is opium to the masses, but TV is not.  (t6-8)  	Television, a thing which emerged less than 50 years ago, is still in its infantile period in the perspective of history. Like many new things in the 20th century, (and there are so many of them), television is born controversial. Some said: "Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the end of the 20th century, he would replace religion with television." Such arguments are not infrequently seen on publications. However, television supporters argue no less eloquently.  	It is beyond doubt that television is a product of human technology and its existence embodies the substantial progress of man's capability: a message or a piece of information, with aural and visual quality, can be transmitted around the earth at light speed. One does not have to go outdoors to know what is happening in the world. With the advance of modern "magic" --- high technologies [np5,1-] television will soon be upgraded to be the individual terminal linked to a huge global net from which one can get almost whatever he wants: entertainment, knowledge, and all kinds of information that might interest him. The quantity of convenience television has already brought to man will be greatly enhanced by that prospect.  	In the view of economist [np6,4-] television represents a recently acknowledged industry --- Service Industry. The bith [fm1,-] of television surely serves as an important factor in the economy boom in the 20th century, especially after World War II. It accelerates the pace of world trade communication, explores numerous fields of co-operation which could be permanently dormant without it, and gives many chances to promote sales and, in turn, the development of other industries, not to mention the millions of jobs it has helped create.  	As a social product, television is also a coin of two sides. Just like opium, which can be used to cure people as well as to kill people, television has brought some evil effects while doing mostly good. But it caters for the very needs of progress of human civilization. It might wander about a little in its growing years, but it will be an effective and efficient tool to the advantage of human society. Religion might disappear with man's self-perfection, but television will persist and survive and do its bit in this world.  (t6-9)  	Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. Nowadays some people say that if Marx were alive at the end of the 20th century, he would replace religion with television. But my opinion is that television is NOT the opium of the masses.  	Firstly, watching television is convenient and entertaining. Modern age is an age of high speed. People have to strain themselves while working in their office. So their spare time and holidays become very precious and relaxing to them. They usually enjoy this time by going to the theater or cinema. However, after queuing for a long time in order to buy a ticket, they find that the show is rather dull and boring. But if they stay at home, press down the button of the television, they could choose the program they like, which is very convenient, and be well entertained. There are numerous programs such as TV series, sports show, etc. which can give one more entertainment than the theater does, without wasting one precious minute of his spare time. 	 	Secondly, watching television can improve human relationship. When seeing a family sit together before television, chatting, laughing, exchanging ideas about the program, or sometimes even arguing with each other, aren't you moved by this hamonious [fm1,-] picture? While at the daytime, every member of the family is busy with his work [sn8,s-] having little time in communicating with other family members. While at night, by watching television, they can enjoy each other, and as a result, the atmosphere at home grows warmer and warmer. Moreover, television programs offer topics for talk among friends, acquaintances and colleagues, serving as the small talk which can break ice among people, and therefore, can make people more friendly and improve their relationship.  	Finally, watching television is informative [cc2,3-] It can enlarge one's scope of knowledge quickly and in an impressive way --- through pictures. Television is no wonder a great invention of this age of information. Since one's sphere of life and his means to acquire knowledge are quite limited, it is hard to keep him informed without the help from television. Thanks to the news programs, one can learn about the latest national and international affairs. Thanks to the travel programs, one can enjoy the beauty of nature while staying at home. For instance, by watching "Zheng Da Zong Yi", Chinese viewers can get some idea of the splendid scenery in foreign countries, which they may never have the chance to visit. Thanks to the teaching programs, children as well as adults can learn foreign languages, science course [np6,1-] ; housewives can learn how to cook; women can learn how to build up their body; and on top of that, shows like those that are meant to arouse patriotism or to teach manners are very instructive for children's growth.  	In short, although television does have some disadvantages. if a viewer can watch it in a proper way, its advantages will overweigh its disadvantages. Television is in no sense the opium of the masses.  (t6-10)  	Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the end of the 20th century, he would replace religion with television. It is true in some degree, but, for the most part, it is not.  	As we know, television is the great invention of the 20th century. It provides a great opportunity for people to learn more about the world, to enlarge our scope of knowledge and to enjoy ourselves after hard work. Thus, television plays an important role in [wd4,-1] society.  	On our globe, there are all kinds of places and there are various kinds of people living there who have different customs and traditions. But not all of us are able to go around the world to see them face to face. Then television is introduced to us and opens the door for us to travel in those places and enables us to see what happens there, to hear what those people say, and to feel what they experience only on that little screen.  	Besides, television is not only our omnipotent guide, but also our all-powerful teacher and informer. Since not everyone is able to receive education at school, television takes the responsibility to educate us at home. Without going outside, we come to learn certain skills, to get very useful information for our work and study, and then we broaden our minds in this way.  	In addition, television is also our entertainer who can make us relax after a day's work. Since we live in a more and more competitive society, we have to try our best to be capable [aj2,-1] for our work, which needs much of our attention and energy. After work, we are nearly crushed down. Then, TV says hello to us with a smile and makes us relax with smile [np6,1-] as well.  	Although some programs on TV really do harm to the viewers, such as the children, it is not television that ought to be responsible, instead, it is us users who should make good use of it. Television is a good tool and will be a better one if we make efforts to be its good users.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH B2W> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (b2w-t6-1)  Before TV set was invented, people could only listen to the news. They had to go to the theatre and concert hall to enjoy dramas and plays. Since TV sets came into being, the situation has changed greatly. People needn't pay too much money, and they can know lots of things around the world without going out. By now, nearly each family has one or even two TV sets, They spend most of their leisure time in watching TV. It is true that the TV programmes can give people pleasure and knowladge [fm1,-] But on the other hand, TV may destroy the viewers, like what is done by the opium.  Firstly, TV may do harm to the viewers' health. When TV is on, its screen sends out a kind of ray. This ray may damage people's eyes. After a long time of watching TV, they may become short-sighted. In addition, people sitting in the same pose for a long time may feel very tired and this can do harm to the flow of blood. Some even suffer from psoatic [fm1,-] strain, arthritis, etc.. Nowadays, many children like spending their spare time in watching TV. Many parents also allow their children to do it. Gradually, TV becomes a baby-sitter. Parents don't know that what they are doing is not helpful to their children. On the contrary, it is a drug which may destroy children's health little by little.  Secondly, the content of some TV programmes may do harm to the viewers. Nowadays, the world is full of competition. In order to ingratiate [vp1,-2] the viewers' tastes, producers add many unhealthy contents in their programmes. For example, the content includes sex, fighting, horror, etc.. These programmes, especially the horrorible [fm2,-] films, may frighten the viewers. According to a record, in 1980's in America, a mother left her two children watching TV in their own room. Half an hour later, she heard a horrible cry from the room. The mother ran to the room, only to find her two lovely boys sitting in front of the TV set, dead. It was the horrible programme on TV that frightened the boys to death.  Thirdly, some TV programmes teach people bad things. Nearly all the heros [fm2,-] smoke. Most plays have something to do with love and sex. Many pictures are full of violence. The viewers, especially the children, like to learn from what they have seen on TV. They admire the heros [fm2,-] in the plays, and immitate [fm1-] their movements, no matter who they are, true heros [fm2,-] or thugs. In America, many students go to school with guns in their pockets. They act as if they were as brave and venturous as Robinhood. They even shoot others in the street. Kongfu is popular in China now. Many people learn Wushu by themselves and some even broke their arms and legs.  TV, as a media [np3,3-] of modern communication does help us to know more about the world. But on the other hand, it harms us at the same time. The bad effect may not be found instantly. TV is like the opium whose harm will spread gradually, and its influence is deep and terrible. To sum up, we must be careful when watching TV. Try not to be addicted to it. (b2w-t6-2)  Man is killing himself. This statement is not astonishing when one thinks of the war going on in Bosnia Hertzergovina and the nuclear weapon that, once released, would kill the whole population at a wink. But it is astonishing if one says that the recreation means produced by inventive human beings are imposing threat [np6,s-] on human lives. However astonishing and ridiculous it may sound, it is true. Television, one of the major recreation facilities in the world, has a significant potentiality of merciless killing.  A great thinker of last century, Karl Marx, said that religion was the opium of the masses. Most Chinese must be quite aware of the terrifying power of opium. Last century, the unchecked inflow of opium from the western countries almost killed their nation. As we all know, [wd4,-5] proper dose of opium is powerful [wd2,-1] curative, but excessive opium would threaten one's health and mentality as well, like a slow poison does. The same is ture [fm1,-] with religion. If we consider there is a God [fm3,1-] in our mind, a God [fm3,1-] that embodies moral codes and judging standards that act as a supervisor which [pr5,2-] guarantees [vp1,-5] us doing good all the time and keeps us from betraying our own principles, religion, in this sense, is not bad. But if one is too much steeped in the illusory heaven of religion, religion would have its adverse effect on him by demoralizing his will.  Let's look at television, which, as a breakthrough in the history of technological progress, acts as an [wd5,s-] effective mass media, providing information and pleasure, and thus helping to enrich one's knowledge and relieve his emotional and physical tention [fm1,-] But like opium and religion, excessive exposure to TV programes are [vp3,5-] slowly killing.  Firstly, TV harms one's physique. When I was a primary school pupil, glass-wearers were quite rare, even among middle-school and college students. But now, glasses, once seen as a token of the intellectual, are common even in primary school. Why is that? TV is one of the main causes. Long-time sitting in the dark room with the eyes fixed upon the screen does great harm to the eyes, and at the same time, time for outgoing and exercising is diminished, which also contributes to bad health.  Physical influence is one aspect. Mental influence is much more harmful. Juvenile delinquency is increasingly become [vp9,2-] a focus of social concern. Criminologists state that one of the reasons for juvenile delinquency should be attributed to television programes [fm1,-] featuring pornography and violence, which have a significant decaying influence on teenagers's mind. Youngsters have a genius of [wd3,2-] imagination and immitation [fm1,-] Owing to inexperience and immaturity, they easily get involved in the story that TV creats [fm1,-] and naturally take it as the reality. Then they practise violence without ever bothering a second's thinking about the illegality of their behaviour. Can one remain at ease when a 7-year-old boy killed a 4-year-old girl and seemed as if nothing had happened after the killing?  Thirdly, TV is dehumanizing. It is depriving [vp1,4] the time of mutual communication and deepening the gap between family members. As a resident student, the once-a-week get-together with my family is quite precious to me. But every time at supper, when I ventured to stike [fm1,-] a conversation with my family, I found that TV is [vp6,s-] always outshining me and attract [vp9,s-] much more attention than I could [wd7,s-] After several failure [np3,2-] I began to remain silence [wd2,1-] at the table with so many words of profound emotion on the verge of my lips, while my parents, sisters and brothers were fixing their eyes on the TV screen and at the same time stuffing rice and dish into their mouths.  TV is killing, inconspicuously yet significantly. It is killing people's health. It is killing their human feelings. It is killing the innocence and purity of the young, and it is killing the leisure and peace of the old. It is making a world of coldness, loneliness and inhumanity. Marx hadn't be [vp9,1-2] able to live to see the world of today, the age of television. Otherwise he might replace religion with television and say that "television is the opium of the masses".  In the early years of this century, a famous Chinese writer and thinker named Luxun appealed in one of his stories, "Save the children." Now, at the turn of this century, it's highly necessary to appeal again. Be careful with the monster killer --- television, for the sake of children and of all the human beings. (b2w-t6-3)  Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. As an atheist, I don't believe in any kinds of religion. And I don't know whether religion was the opium of the masses or not. If Marx was alive at the end of the 20th century, he would replace religion with television. That is to say, TV is the opium of the masses in the 20th century.  In a certain sense, religion, television and opium share a dual attribute. On the one hand, they are useful and sometimes necessary; on the other hand, they are harmful and sometimes destructive.  Opium is a substance prepared from poppy seeds. Owing to its narcotic nature, it was used to relieve pain and cause sleep at first. But with constant use of it, people will be addicted to it and gradually become sallow and emaciated, listless and dispirited. In Qing Dynasty, a lot of Chinese died in opium-dens because of overuse or long-use of opium.  Since television was invented in the 50s, it has developed so quickly that it has made earthshaking changes in billions of people's life. As the fruit of high technology, it is a continuous cheap source of information and entertainment, having much more advantage over newspaper and radio. And it provides enormous possibilities for education. But we are already beginning to forget what the world was like without it. And people don't dare to imagine what the world will be like without it. Because we are addicted to television, like those who are addicted to opium. [sn2,s] The most dangerous thing about opium is that it can make one addicted in a painless, pleasant way before he knows it. Television can do exactly the same. Now whole generations are growing up addicted to it [sn8,s-] Food is left uneaten, home-work undone and sleep is lost. All our free time is regulated by the magic box. Television cuts us off from the real world. We get so lazy, we choose to spend a fine day in semi-darkness, glued to our chair, rather than go out into the world itself. Television may be a splendid medium of communication, but it prevents us from communicating with each other.  It goes without saying that bad TV programmes can do great harm, especially to children. It is now standard practice for mother to keep the children quiet by putting them in front of the TV. The rubbishy commercials are OK, but spectacles of sex and violence can destroy an innocent soul totally. Owing to its world-wide covering range, the damage of bad programmes can be a world-wide catastraphe [fm1,-]  That is television --- the opium of the masses in the 20th century. It can do endless good as well as irreparable harm. We should handle it as carefully as we handle opium, making best use of its advantage and getting rid of its harm. (b2w-t6-4)  Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the end of the 20th century, he would replace religion with the television.  Of course, Marx couldn't predict the destiny of the TV. However, many socialists are worrying about the bad effect [np3,s-] brought by television. It has taken them much time to survey [vp1,-3] that how many people spend how much time on TV every day. What's more, they even draw such a conclusion that the increase of the criminal [cc1,-1] rate is caused by TV.  Well, is it true?  Firstly, we have to admit that some TV programmes contain sex and Violation [wd3,s-] which does great harm to the youth, even some adults. Many young people can't distinguish some good thing from the bad. They are very easily influenced by what they watch. In China, we have such a saying which goes like: Easy to learn the bad while difficult to learn the good.  Secondly, we must see the importance of TV as a means of the mass media. People can get more and more information at home from TV set [wd5,s-] instead of going outside. More and more people even can have classes from TV. In China and many other countries, TV universities are becoming more prosperous.  Thirdly, TV is an important means of the recreation and entertainment. Before the Age of TV, people had to go outside to the circus or theatre if they wanted to enjoy themselves. Now it is simple. People can sit in coaches [wd3,s-] watching their favourite programmes. Today, the TV programmes are so wonderful that many people sit and watch until late in [wd3,1-1] night.  Fourthly, TV is a new scientific invention of our century. Since its birth, it has brought people more and more joy and happiness. Furthermore, TV helps the scientists with the experiments.  Fifthly, TV is more and more significant in today's political life. In the United States, in recent years each president takes the TV as the most important means to publicize their political views and plans. To some extent, John F Kennedy won the presidential election with the help of the TV. Nowadays in China, people get much information about their own country and their party from TV. As radio, newspapers, magazines and other means of the masses [wd3,1-1] media, TV is commonly used and accepted. It occupies the extremely significant position in people's daily life.  According to the five points I've mentioned, there is only on [fm1,-] demerit of TV. TV brings much more good things than the bad, so we can't consider it as opium. To sum up, TV isn't opium of the masses in the 20th century. (b2w-t6-5)  Opium is originally defined as the substance used to relieve pain, cause sleep, and as a narcotic drug. In this article it is employed to describe how TV programs in the 20th century attract and intoxicate people.  Television, one of the greatest inventions in the 20th century, has brought prosperity to the society: it makes [wd4,s-] the fastest communication of the latest information, serves as the advanced teaching facility, and provide [vp3,s-] people with rich-content entertainments. Pitifully, the television in the 20th century is developing to be so appealing to people that it becomes a fatal controller of people's mind.  Looking back to the history of television, one can easily find out that shortly after the invention of television, the television programs are simple reflections of the positive and neutual [fm1,-] sides of nature and society. People could hitherto learn and get enjoyment from television. At that time only few people could afford to buy television [np6,2-] So the early televisions were almost harmless to people. With the development of science and technology, more and more televisions were produced. Meanwhile, more and more television programs were produced by different people to reflect various aspects of the world: politics, economics, cultures, especially the lives of people in different social status. Through a television, one can watch almost anything, either good or bad, true or false, beautiful or ugly. Thus people are given a broad view of the enormous things to widen their horizon. When they come to know more, problems arised [fm2,-] : they must cultivate the ability to distinguish [wd4,1-1] positive from [wd4,1-1] negative, otherwise it would be dangerous because the negative television programs may poison their minds and mislead their behaviour.  Like any other goods, television programs can not be produced and broadcast without being influenced by the laws of economics. More and more producers make it their main purpose to earn as much money as possible. Guided by this, they try to produce many programs which can bring them great profits, i.e., the programs which most people like watching because they are full of stimulation, excitement and eccentricity. Naturally these features of television programs are connected with violence, sex, superstition and other degraded social phenomena. Unfortunatly [fm1,-] quite few could resist the tempertation [fm1,-] They watch these programs all the time without feeling tired, and even imitate the people in the programs. In the United States, for example, due to the fiery competition of many television stations, some of them produced series of television programs showing people how different criminals were set [wd3,s-] on to the path of committing crimes. These programs were full of violence and sex, and make deep impression [np6,2-] on the audience, especially the young prople [fm1,-] As a result, a Canadian couple, who had watched the programs, killed several innocent people by imitating the hero and heroine of the programs.  Nowadays, in the late of the [wd5,4-2] 20th century, no one can grow up without been [wd3,1-] affected by television. Most people in the world find it economical, convenient and easy to watch TV rather than go to the cinema or go in for other forms of entertainments. This TV viewing habit may spoil their creativity and active factors of their minds. To make things worse, most people are unable to select good TV programs and avoid watching harmful ones. Once they are taken up with something stimulating and exciting, it is by no means easy for them to give it up on TV [wd5,s-] Just as a person who has been intoxicated by opium cannot give the poison up [sn2,s-] (b2w-t6-6)  Television, [sn9,s-] is doing irrevocable harm to human being [np6,2-] Although television does not enter people's home for a long time, most of us have been very depentdant [fm1,-] on it. We cannot imagine what the world was like without it. Television has not only dominated our heart but also stole [vp9,s-] our health in both spiritual and physical senses. The truth is, television is an [wd5,-1] opium in the morden [fm1,-] world.  Television is a potential killer of our life. From the health [cc1,-3] point of view, television has ill effect on our body. Radiation from the screen can cause various disease [np3,1-] From the time [cc1,2-3] point of view, it is killing our life [cc3,4-] by consuming [wd4,2-4] amount of precious time. According to a survey, American [np3,-2] spend 30 hours in watching TV every week. The same is true of chinese [fm3,2-1] whom TV set was introduced to a few years ago. That is to say, almost one-third of human's life are [vp3,1-] devoted to TV while they regret life is short.  Television does harm to our mind. Foreign educators report that the generation growing up with television can barely write an English sentence, even at the college level. As we know, writing is often learned from reading, howere [fm1,-] most children are not going to reads [vp4,2-1] books since watching TV was [vp6,s-] easier. Besides, watching TV involves little imgination [fm1,-] With the aid of the pictures and spoken words, we have no need to trouble ourselves in using our minds. Noverthles [fm1,-] more illiterate generations are much better than corrupted generations. As a matter of fact, the rubbishy commercials, the spectacles of sadism and violence are poisoning the growing up generations.  Television is a barrier of social communiation [fm1,-] TV may be a splendid medium of communication, but it prevents us from communicating with other people. We used to sit around together after dinner and have a small talk to one another. Now, we give up free talks after dinner. We gulp down our meals to be in time for this or that program. In front of [wd4, 2-2] TV set, we must keep silent as well. If any member of the family dares to open his mouth during a programme, he will be quickly hushed.  Little by little, television cuts us off from the real world. In the past, we would go outside or [wd7,s-] our amusements to theatres, cinemas, restaurants and sporting events. Now we get so lazy, we choose to spend a fine day in front of TV, rather than go out into the world itself.  Once we are addicted to the telly [fm1,-] food will be left uneaten, homework undone and sleep will be lost. In this way, telly [fm1,-] is as harmful as opium. We are attracted, and then we are intoxicated, at last we are corrupted. Karl Marx once said that religion was the opium in [wd4, 1-2] twentith [fm1,-] century. Then Television is the opium to the mass [wd3,s-] too. (b2w-t6-7)  Most of the Americans born post-war [wd2,s-] could not imagine what the world would like without televisions. They are so called "the Generation of Television". Thus it can be seen that TV had a great effect on their lives. Today TV becomes the most popular mass media in the world. Many families are equipped with more than one television. The Color-TV has replaced the black-and-white TV. Cable televisions are univerlizing [fm1,-][wd3,-] Communicate [wd2,-2] satellites transmit various programmes from all over the world and outer space itself [wd5,s-]  TV appears in front of us at certain intervals like an unexpected visitor or a ghost. It is always a guide. But to most people, it is an accompany [fm1,-] It is a habit, a sedative. TV becomes so important to us that it becomes one part of our daily life.  However, TV --- [wd4,s-5] the most popular communicate [wd2,2-2] media [sn9,s-] gets more and more criticise [wd2,3-] now. It is considered the opium of the 20th centuary [fm1,-] It hurt [vp3,1-] people not only phisically [fm1,-] but also mentally.  TV exhausts people's spare time. Some people spend so much time in front of the television that they suffer from a disease called "TV Syndrome". In Britain, a government survey shows that more than 5,000 persons are sent to hospital because of watching TV each year. Some faint at song scenes; Some are injured while doing chores with their eyes on the screen. A man got injured because of punching the screen while he was watching a boxing match; A woman got injured while she tried a head-butt; A girl dislocated her knee while she danced wildly with a pop show; A rugby fan jumped up with joy when he saw the British team scored, but unfortunately his head was crashed [vp7,s-] into a chandelier.  The list seemed endless. But what is most concerned nowadays is TV's impact on school children. Us [fm3,d] public considers that violence and pornography are the most serious problems in US television industry. It is caculated [fm1,-] that during the Golden Time each day --- there are 7 violent [cc4,-1] scenes each hour on average; during the period when catoons [fm1,-] for children are relayed, there are 14 violent [cc4,-1] scenes per hour. Obscene scenes are alwayes [fm1,-] mixed with violence.  Most of the American people, especially the mothers, are convinced that violence and obscene scenes on TV are likely to corrupt children. The statics [fm1,-] shows that US children under 16-year-old [wd2,1-] spend more time in watching TV than in school. Before they graduate from high schools, they have watched 350,000 advertisements and 19,000 murder events on TV. Transmission of aggression may lead to the imitation of aggressive morals. TV shapes the soul of children who are growing up. Another survey points out that the children who have intense conflicts with their parents are prone to be keen on TV. They indulge themselves in the world of fantacy [fm1,-] which TV creates. Thus we can see that TV is really harmful to children.  Although TV brings us a lot of joys and makes our lives more colorful, its Harmness [wd3,s-] is seen and becomes [vp1,-3] to be realized by more and more people. Being a guide of the masses [sn3,s-] we hope that TV will never lead [cc3,-3] a role of the opium, instead it should be a good guide. (b2w-t6-8)  TV, which was invented dozens [wd4,1-2] years ago, is nearly indispensable to our everyday life. In [wd4,1-2] modern world, we need to know about [pp1,-s-] what are happening in this planet, we want to keep in touch with all the valuable information, we'd like to seek recreation after a day's hard work, all these problems can be solved by one simple action --- pushing the button of a TV set. It is the TV that makes this happing [fm1,-] TV have [vp3,1-] changed our lives greatly. It really does great good to the masses. However, all the coins have two sides. TV also have [vp3,2-] caused great troubles. It is becoming the opium of the masses in the 20th centuary [fm1,-]  Firstly, the TV eats out nearly all the spare time that we should spend [vp1,-4] to do something else. At dinner, we can not enjoy the free time with our family. We can not communicate with them because the TV news is on due [wd3,-] We have not enough time to discuss, laugh, joke with our parents and relatives for the TV series need finishing [wd3,3-]  Secondly, TV makes us lazy. Some people would prefer watching a football game to playing it. After dinner, TV defines [fm1,-] us in the sofa and sitting there for three or more hours [sn8,s-] When we are in bed, we are still snatched by the romance of heros [fm2,-] and heroines in the series. Thus the whole evening were [vp3,2-] used up in front of the screen.  Thirdly, TV sometimes degrades the standards of morality. Recently, more and more violent and obscene stories appeared on TV. Some youngsters are not old enough to distinguish good from bad. They are easily moved and changed by the story. Imitation is children's nature. Sometimes tragedy happened [vp6,d] because of the bad effect of TV. For example, it is reported that a boy in Los Angelos [fm1,-] was trying to imitate the bad man. He manipulated the ropes in an effort to fly. But he failed and could not get himself down. He was hanged to death. His death shocked a lot of people. They wrote letters and phoned to call for the deduction of violence in mass media. From this story, we can judge how [pr5,-2] great harmness [wd3,2-4] have [vp3,-3] the TV done to the yougsters [fm1,-] [sn8,s-]  In conclusion, the TV is becoming the opium of the masses, we should try our best to clean it and make it useful to us. (b2w-t6-9)  TV is not the opium of the 20th century. On the contrary, it does no harm to the masses. TV is the communication channel between the broad masses and the outside world. With the development of modern technique, TV has become an inseparatable [fm2,-] part of people's daily life.  First of all, TV can provide entertainment which makes the masses' life rich and colorful. With the help of TV, people can enjoy various kinds of programs on TV screen without leaving their homes. Those programs include [wd4,1-2] circus show, variety entertainment, film [np6,2-2] opera, and many other forms of art. All this makes it possible for the masses to get recreation in a convenient way so as to enliven their life and keep them always in high spirits. As a result, People's spare time becomes vivid and meaningful.  Secondly, with the help of TV, mass-education becomes possible. Education can be given more widely than before, because even people in remote areas or people with certain disabilities can receive education freely and conveniently like anybody else. All they must have is a TV set. It is believed that TV is playing a more important role in mass- education than it did any time before, since many open unversities [fm1,-] give their courses through TV programs. As a result, more people than ever can get adequate education, which leads to the enhancement of people's quality.  Thirdly, TV can privide [fm1,-] all kinds of knowledge. Today, TV program producers are paying a lot [wd4,1-1] attention to the range of knowledge their program can offer. Therefore, most programs are intended to inform and to give knowledge so as to make the masses keep pace with the time and know more about the world, both man's inner world and outer world. The most typical one is the news program. This program keeps the masses well informed of what's going on in the world. People can travel before the TV screen. They can go anywhere with the program without any hindrance. Take the program on sightseeing for example. People just stay in front of the TV set comfortably, and they can start their journey. The programs on the nature also provide konwledge [fm1,-] to [wd3,3-1] the broad masses. Thus, people will not only know things about themselves, but also the fauna and flaura [fm1,-] world. In a word, the masses can obtain a lot of knowledge from TV programs.  Those are the basic reasons why TV is not the opium of the 20th century. The masses are the biggest beneficiary [np6,5-] of TV. Nobody can deny the benefit and the help TV has brought about. What's more, even Marxism is publicized by TV program. If Marx lived today, he would never say that TV is the opium of the 20th century at seeing TV is such a wonderful invention. (b2w-t6-10)  Since the end of the 19th century, science and technology have developed very fast. Great changes have taken place in different fields, especially in communication, machinery, chemistry. We befenit [fm1,-] a lot from it. It makes our life better and convenient.  People benefit a lot from the creation of TV. It widens our horizen [fm1,-] and helps us to keep in touch with the world current affairs. It helps us to know different countries and different people. But on the whole, it also causes many serious problems.  Firstly, it is harmful to the children. The children always spend too much time on [wd3,4-] watching TV. It is bad for their eyes. According to the statistics, the children who spend less than 2 hours a day watching TV are more capable in thinking and judging than the children who spend more than 4 hours a day watching TV. Nowadays, many children can recite many TV advertisements, but can't recite the text. It is ridiculous.  Secondly, it causes bad effects to the teenager. At present, many TV programmes are related to pornograghy [fm1,-] and violence. When the teenager [np3,s-1] see these, they really get excited. They want to follow the [vp2,1-1] suit and taste [cc3,-2] the fresh feeling. So there are more and more robbery, theft, and rape. It threatens the people and makes [wd4,2-2] society unstable.  Thirdly, it stimulates consumption and causes advance consumption. In order to attract the consumer, most of the advertisements use exaggerated technique [np6,s-] in language, music and picture [np6,1-] It arouses the people's curiosity and possessing desire. It causes people to buy this or buy that through payment by installment. Although it will increase the whole sale or retail sale, it does not bring permenant [fm1,-] profit to the economic [wd2,2-] Sometimes, fake goods are also advertised on TV, it cheats the consumers.  On the whole, the invention of TV is one of the great steps in science and technology. But people have overused it or used it in unproper [fm2,-] ways. So it brings harmness [wd3,s-] to the society. There is a saying which goes [wd3,s-] "to [fm1,-] much will cause trouble". Like religion, which used to be the opium of the mass [wd3,s-] TV is the opium of the mass [wd3,s-] in the 20th century. 

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GW> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (t7-1)  	Almost all the countries have their own army. The main duty of an army is to keep peace for their people. But, of course, they are often ordered to do many others [wd2,1-1] things that need force. In order to have large and conventional forces, many countries had set up a system of military services. They require every young man [wd4,s-] reaches the age of 20-22 to serve in the army for at least 2 years.  	Because soldiers are often ordered to take part in the fights in [wd7,s-] or abroad, and quite a number of them will die, most of the young men don't want to serve in the army. In the countries with military service system, many young men [wd4,s-] reach the conscription age try everything possible to evade being drafted, for example, going abroad, falsifying medical record, etc. Even [wd7,s-] some of them can't evade the conscription and be [vp9,s-] drafted to the army, they don't want to stay there for several years obediently. The [fm1,-] will always contrive to release [vp1,2-] ahead of time. So, they won't fight bravely in the war and they will possibly become an army deserter [np3,s-] in a dangerous battle. And because they are not of their own will [wd7,s-] they won't try their best to serve the army. So, the combat effectiveness will not be high and their will to fight will not be firm. Also, support [vp4,-5] such an army will waste many [cc4,-4] [np8,-4] of the country's property. Some country [np3,1-] realized this and abandoned the military service system, including U.S.A. after the Vietnam War [ad1,s-]  	In these countries, they have voluntary and professional soldiers. Their army, consisting [vp1,-3] entirely professional soldiers who have rich experience and firm will, will have very high combat effectiveness. In fighting, they can do their best. And because, [sn9,s-] they regard being a soldier as their profession, they would like to stay in the army willingly. Such crack troops will really work in the war.  	So, in my opinion all the armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers. And the system of military service should be abandoned gradually.  (t7-2)  	There are two trend [np3,1-] of military services in the world nowadays: one is recruiting professional soldiers; the other is recruiting compulsory serviceman [np6,s-] Since the system of military service has some shortcomings, enlisting professional soldiers becomes more and more popular.  	In some countries, the governments carry out a policy that it is an obligation for every citizen who reaches a certain age to serve several years in the army. Yet, this policy is strongly against [wd7,s-] by a large number of people. Joining the army sometimes means fighting, injury and death. Some people are afaid [fm1,-] of taking part in the army and they contrive to shirk the obligation. So in this sense, it is very difficult for the government to get new soldiers. Even they are in the army, it is also possible for them to play the roles of deserters, especially in the battle field. These would seriously weaken the combat effectiveness of the army and directly threaten the security of the country.  	Secondly, the system of military service may waste some people's time, especially the "experts". The U.S. President, Mr. Clinton used to escape serving in the U.S. army during the Vietnam War. Later he explained that he considered it more useful for himself to study in Moscow than fight [wd2,s-] in Vietnam. It is true that not everyone is suitable for the military service; some people will make greater success if they do not join the army and have much more time. For example, a famous singer in Taiwan performed military service for three years. During this period, he had not sung for his fans and lost nearly half of his audience. This made him depressed. Maybe he would have been successful if he didn't spend [vp8,s-] three years in the army.  	Moreover, though a strong army can guarantee the steady growth of economy, an army with a [np7,-1] excess number is a burden to the economy. So if a country implements a policy of military service, more and more people will take part in the army. In order to sustain such a large army, the government has to increase military expenditure, which may impede the economy's development.  	To conclude, since there is no value in a system of military service, all armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers.  (t7-3)  	Most of the countries in the world has [vp3,s-] a system of military service, which requires the young men to serve in the armies for a couple of years. Some may think that this system is unnecessary, and that all armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers. My opinion is just the opposite.  	People all over the world advocate peace and object to wars, since wars always bring disasters to both the winner and the failer [fm2,-] We hope that one day there will be no armies. But now that wars take place now and then, here and there, it is impossible to get rid of armies now.  	Every country has its own army. They make great effort to develop their national defense, because national defense is considered to be one of the elements indicating the level of a country's development. But it is not always the case. National defense is strong in some poor country [np3,2-]  	So long as armies exist, there are professinal [fm1,-] soldiers, though not so many. They have been trained for many years and have all kinds of knowledge about wars, weapons and so on. They play a very important role in wars. In this way, we say it is necessary to have professional soldiers in armies. But, whether the armies should be entirely made up of professional soldiers is another thing.  	A country needs people to do all kinds of work. Serving in the army is only one of them. I don't think people would like to stay in army for all their life (may be some do). If a war comes when they get too old, what will be the result? They have [vp6,d] lost their energy by then. When a war really takes place, it needs more people to take part in. Only the professional soldiers are not enough. More young people are needed. So they should learn some skills in case [sn8,s-] needed to defend their country. However, we can't say that those with more young men serving in armies will win in a war. That depends on many other things.  	It is also good for the young men themselves to take military service [cc3,2-] The several years' training will benefit them a lot. They gain skills, temper their willpower and become strong. Also, patriotism will take root in their mind. After this experience, most of them can endure difficulties in work and in life.  	Military service system is necessary for both the country and the people themselves. It will have its value unless there is no war in the world.  (t7-4)  	A lot of countries carry out a system of military service, that is, every citizen above or under certain ages should attend military service [cc3,2-] for [wd4,1-2] certain period [np6,2-] But I think nowadays it is not necessary to have such a system.  	Firstly, technology takes the most important role in today's war. Sometimes either side in the battle field is invisible by naked eyes to the other side, but they can still fight each other. More sodiers [fm1,-] mean more chance of losing lives. The dominant element in winning a war is not the quatity [fm1,-] of the sodies [fm1,-] but how active a role technology plays.  	Secondly, the more active a role technology plays, the more powerful weapons are produced [sn4,s-] which need [vp3,s-] more cooperation and complicated operations, requiring high quality sodiers [fm1,-] [wd7,s-] Only those professional sodiers [fm1,-] who have received a long period of professional training can be qualitified [fm1,-]  	Thirdly, a nation should have enough working force for its economic development. Especially for those developed countries, [wd4,s-] short of manpower seriously restricts the country from [cc3,3-] further development. This, can I say [sn2,-] is a tremendous waste of society wealth [cc1,1-]  	Thus we can see that today's war is professional sodiers [fm1,-] business. Quality is better than quantity.  (t7-5)  	In our world, almost all countries have armies. Armies are supposed to defend their motherlands, though some armies are used for invading and suppressing. Armies also play an important role in the political stage. Usually an army is composed of professional soldiers, military servicemen, or mercenaries. Today, most armies pay more and more attention to professional soldiers, and this is reasonable.  	Firstly, with the development of the modern high technologies, armies stress [vp1,s-] on the quality of soldiers but not quantity in order to increase their combat effectiveness. To train a qualified soldier, the army has to spend time and money. But, as a military serviceman, a soldier will leave the army when his term is over. So an army with military servicemen always lose [vp3,5-] good and skillful soldiers. If the army is made up of prefessional [fm1,-] soldiers, things will be different. To a professional soldier, military is all of his life. And of course he will try his best to do better because this is his job.  	Secondly, It is obvious that people do things better if they like them. Military service is somewhat compulsory. Some young people are reluctant to join the army since they consider they can contribute more to the country if they take other jobs. When these young ones are absorbed into the army, they seldom can be qualified soldiers. Then the army does nothing but waste time and money. But to young people who love military, they enter the army because they like to be a soldier [np3,5-] Definitely they will become good soldiers.  	From above, we can draw a conclusion that all armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers, [sn9,s] there is no value in a system of military service. Any nation which want [vp3,3-] to have a strong and powerful army should seek its way in professionalization [fm1,-] of soldiers.  (t7-6)  	Almost all the countries in the world have its [pr3,s-] own army. They need army to protect their territory and people. So the government have [vp3,1-] to find the sources of troops. Therefore, arguements [fm2,-] are raised: should all armies consist entirely of professional soldiers? Is there no value in a system of military service?  	In my opinion, the answers of both of the questions are yes and yes.  	An efficient army needs professional soldiers. Generally speaking, a professional soldier is more specialized than an amateur. Thus he can fight more effeciently [fm1,-] in a war. The term of a professional soldier is about eight years or even longer, while the term of a common soldier is only about three years. Therefore, the former has a steability [fm1,-] which the later [wd3,s-] does no [wd3,1-1] have. In addition, it costs the country less money to train a professional soldier. The advantage of an army which consist [vp3,s-] entirely of professional soldiers can be seen from the U.S. army. As we all know, the American Army had an outstanding performance in 1991's Gulf War: It took them no more than four days to defeat the Iraqis and recapture Kuwait. Their success is a strong support of establishing a professional army.  	The system of military service is a negative factor in the army. To some degree, soldiers are forced to join the army under this system. They may become unwilling to fight. This will decrease the morale of the troops. Again, we can find an example from the U.S. army. Under the system of military service, the U.S. Government conscripted soldiers into the army for the Vietnam War. At that time, a lot of young men did not want to join the army and take part in the war. But still, they were conscripted. They fought against their will. The consequence was obvious: A lot of soldiers died and America did not win in the end. Now the U.S. Government does not use the system of military service to maintain the source of troops. They get a professional army. As a result, the army's efficiency is much higher than before. What I want to say is: since the government can get enough soldiers without the system of military service, it is worthless to keep this system.  	From the above, we can say all armies should consist entirely of professional soldies [fm1,-] ; there is no value in a system of military service.  (t7-7)  	 [wd4,-4] Army is very important to a country. It plays a decisive role in safeguarding a country's territorial integrity and resisting aggression. And the quality of an army can decide whether the army is poweful [fm1,-] or not.  	 [wd4,-6] Army is made up by soldiers. So, whether the armed force is strong or not depends on soldiers. Nowadays, there are two systems existing: one is the system of military service, the other is the volunteer system. But I should say, there is no value in a system of military service. All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers. Why do I say that? First of all, let's take American troop as an example. In the 1970s, a war happened between Vietnam and America. At that time, America put the system of military service into pratice [fm1,-] Although having a massive army, they still couldn't defeat a small country. But after they abolished the system, their armed force has been strengthened. The well-trained soldiers' bravery and skillfulness in battle made the multinational forces recieve [fm1,-] great success in the Gulf War. They defeated Irag [fm1,-] and Kuwait within four days.  	From the above, we know that an army's militant solidarity [wd7,s-] and skills is [vp3,s-] one of the key elements in deciding whether you will win or lose. Things done [wd4,s-] of one's own will be much better than done by force. Somebody may not be willing to be a soldier. If they are forced to be, their minds will not concentrate on what they do. Due to the breaking up of morale, the army will surely be crippled. Will this kind of army win the battle? Of course not. Only those who volunteer to fight can devote [vp2,-3] themselves in and try their best. In addition, the period of enlistment is only three years, while professional soldiers fight until they are too old to fight. Regardless of skills or experiences, professional soldiers will be much better than those who perform military service.  	In short, there is no value in a system of military service. We should encourage [wd4,1-2] volunteer system [np6,2-]  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH ZD> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (t7-1)  	A military service system used to be or is still existing in almost every country in the world. However, whether such a system is still necessary in the peaceful time remains controversial. Some people relate the system exactly to war preparation and hold that since it trains people to fight or desire to fight, non-professional soldiers should be excluded from it so that they can always keep peaceful in mind. In my opinion, different nations can make different choices, depending on the situation they are in.   Take China as an example. In Chinese history, it's rare that the government hire [vp3,s-] soldiers to fight. However, in the 1930s and 1940s, there were people fighting for the National Party's side, only concerning [vp1,-s-] about how much money they could get. After liberation, mostly [wd2,-1] volunteers are engaged in war. And people enter into the profession with different purposes. In the Carean [fm1,2-1] War, young people fight [vp6,s-] against the "imperialist [np6,s-] " in order to defend their "comrades", and in the Vietnam War, they fight [vp6,s-] because they had to defend their own country. In these two cases, they only concern [vp1,-s-] about the interest of the country instead of their personal need. But things are different nowadays. Only those young people [wd4,s-] fail to go to college or find a satisfying job enter [vp2,-2] into [wd4,1-1] army. And the military system provides [vp1,-s-] them chances to learn some practical skills such as driving, that will help them find a job in the future. Moreover, the army is efficient in helping build up a person's sense of morality and discipline, through its strict training. Being taught that they should respect their superior in the army, young people learn to pay respect to other people in the society. Of course, it's true that a military system is training people to fight, but this is not the most important purpose. In a [wd5,1-2] peaceful time, few people desire to fight unless their senses of responsibity [fm1,-] to their own country are stirred. Still, there are professional soldiers in Chinese [np7,-]army, but they work only to keep the military system in function. They are not part of a killing machine either.  	In conclusion, I think a group of professional soldiers is only necessary when a threat of war really occurs, but a military system can exist at any time because it can not only serve to fight a potential war but also [sn6,s-] as a supplement to the common educational system.  (t7-2)  	Nowadays some people believe that all armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service. From my points of view, I don't agree to the statement. Actually, it is practically impossible, at least in our country.  	It is well known that to be an army man is a hard-taking [fm2,-] and even cruel job. Especially during the warring period, soldiers have to face the death anytime and anywhere. I don't think many people would like to take the profession as their life-long career. Besides, since all armies are a state's fighting groups and defence forces, it is necessarily important to keep them fresh, young and energetic so as to maintain the strong fighting ability. When people are in their thirties, their physical height has passed and thus can not meet the tough demand of the army. As a result, most old soldiers should be replaced by the new ones. Moreover, as [wd4,s-] army is a group of good order and discipline, when veterans tranfer [fm1,-] to other units, they will bring at the same time the good customs, which will do a lot of good to the units. Finally, for the long run of the country's defence, a system of military service can help spread the military knowledge and establish a potential force, which may be of great function in case of war.  	Of course, I am not against keeping certain professional soldiers for purposes of military training and senior leadership. But as to have all armies consist of professional soldiers, [sn8,s] it is absolutely unpractical. So to sum up, a system of military service still has its value, and it will be applicable for a long time (say, at least a hundred years).  (t7-3)  	Since we have armies in our country, we enforce the system of military service. But now some people think that all the armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service. In my point of view, this idea is unpractical. The system of miliary [fm1,-] service must be remained and only a small part of armies need [vp3,s-] to be vocationalized [fm1,-]  	As we know, there is a large number of soldiers in our country. Most of them are the young men who reach the age of [wd4,1-1] draft. In the peaceful period, their duty is to defense [wd22,1-2] our country and to keep the social security. It is unnecessary to convert all of them into professional soldiers. Because first, they can deal with their job without much difficulty. [sn2,s] They don't need to accept much professional training. Second, the expenditure on training a professional soldier is large, if all the soldiers are vocationalized, the cost on soldier's [np6,s-] weapon [np6,2-] salary [np6,s-] accommadation [fm1,-] etc. will be a great burden to the government. Third, if these "professional" soldiers retire or quit the army. [sn9,s] it is not easy for them to find a new job because they don't have the training or knowledge for other jobs. How to settle these professional veterans is a hard nut for [wd4,1-1] government. There fore [fm2,1-] at present, it is unnecessary to convert the system.  	But maintanance [fm1,-] of the system of military service does not mean we don't need professional soldiers. In some dangerous fields which require high quality of soldiers, only professional soldiers are competent to deal with the difficult situation because they have much more experience, more advanced weapon [np6,2-] and even better psychology than common soldiers. They can do many things that common soldiers can't do. As the elite of army, professional soldiers take an important status in government's policy [wd7,s-]  	In our country, the system of military service plays an important role in keeping a young army. And those professional soldiers are also indispensable in some fields. We must not neglect either of them or deny either of them. While maintaining the compulsory military system, we also need to convert part of the army into [wd4,s-] professional field.  (t7-4)  	Some people hold the opinion that all armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service. I don't agree with this opinion. As it knows [vp7,s-] to all, any country should have strong national defence [fm1,-] force [np6,3-] to protect itself and resist invasion. And armies play a great role in it. Armies should consist [vp1,-2] professional soldiers, but a system of military service is necessary. Here are my reasons for this.  	It is everybody's responsibility to love and protect his country in every country. The system of military service help [vp3,s-] young people to develop strong will, courage and resolution. People also learn discipline [cc3,-1] and the spirit of unity by military training. During the service, they build their body and mind. Above all, they learn how to challenge and overcome dificulties [fm1,-] During the period of peace, what they learn in the service will have great influence in their later life. If by any chance a war broke out, people all over the country would unite as one and the knowledge of military they had learned [cc3,7-] would help them to fight. In the military service, people receive education of patriotism and learn how to use weapons. So the war will arouse people's love for their country, especially in the case of the invasion. It is no doubt that this country will win the victory.  	In [pp2,-3] the other hand, if the government employs soldiers to protect the country, that means, the soldiers are paid for their services, that will weaken their love for their country and they are apt to do their services just for money. The result of it is that the soldiers' morale will decline. Besides, during the peaceful period, too many professional soldiers will cause the waste of man power.  	From the above, we can see that the system of military system is very important because it concerns a country's sterling military quality of the troops, nationality [wd2,-] defence [fm1,-] force [np6,2-] people's moral standard and so on. So armies should consist [vp1,-2] professional soldiers, at the same time, a system of military system is absolutely necessary.  (t7-5)  	Not all armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers. In practice, an army [wd4,s-] consists of both professional soldiers and non-professional ones (obtained through the system of military service) is more efficient in dealing with different classes of fighting.  	To begin with, for small countries, it's impossible to rely entirely on professional soldiers, instead, they will have to turn to a system of military service. A small country should not be deprived of the right to build up their own army to protect itself and maintain its social order, but if most of the men, for most part of their lives engaged [vp6,s-] themselves in the army, while their energy, their intelligence can be better used in other fields, how can those small countries expect to develop in various areas. [sn9,s-] Take Israil [fm1,-] as an example, its system of military service has enabled it to maintain powerful military force [np6,2-] even as a very small country. And this compulsory system has no doubt foster [vp9,3-3] people's sense of responsibility of protecting their country from any possible invasion from outside and fighting for [wd4,s-] certain cause that they think is right. The sense of participation is something an army composed of only professional soldiers can not offer. Besides, an army consisted [vp5,s-] of both professional soldiers and soldiers drafted compulsorily can better allot its human resource in terms of efficiency. There are different kinds of conflicts, different classes of fighting and war happening where army's service is required to help in an attempt to solve the problem (Though usually it makes things worse). Sometimes non-professional soldiers' presence is sufficient, in other case [np6,s-] professional ones are more experienced in dealing with certain situations. Also, regarding peace-loving peoples [np4,2-1] will, it sends shills [wd3,s-] down their back bone to think that their armies are getting more and more professional, that some of the people are trained through most part of lives to be cold-blooded and learn how to fight and kill efficently [fm1,-]  	Though now the situation of the world does not allow human-beings to elude the word of "fighting" out of their minds [wd7,s-] we have every right to hope that one day, soldier [wd3,s-] as a career will disappear in [wd3,-3] a peaceful earth.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH SJD> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (t7-1)  	Military service will exist as long as the world peace is unrealized. There is a controversy between patriotism and internationalism. How stupid it is to fight! When a man kills a man, no one knows just why. What have we got? Just look at what we have done, all that we destroy we must build again. But, unfortunately, we, [sn9,s-] still need [wd4,1-2] military system. Besides the value of protecting one's own country, there's no value in it. I spent two weeks in Shanghai Pilot Political College as [wd3,s-] Military Training [fm3,s-] which gave me the impression that army training is a process of brain-washing, of being machine [np6,2-] of isolating from the outside. Most of the time, a soilder [fm1,-] needn't go fighting, but his life is also stringed [cc2,4-] and harsh. I can't stand up with [vp2,s-] that kind of life. Imagining [vvvp44,s-] that thousands upon thousands of strong, enegetic [fm1,-] clever young men, [sn9,s-] get up and run, do exercise over and over again, sit around, sing before three meals,.... go throgh [fm1,-] the daily routine for years. What a big waste! If the soilders [fm1,-] are trained to be professional workers, a large amount of labor will be saved. Maybe [wd4,1-2] army is a new klondike [fm3,2-] of intelligence, wealth, and creativity. As we all know, nowdays [fm1,-] criminals are doing varible [fm2,-] jobs with respect to their original profession. Some white collar criminals really do their job well, and invent something. As this is concerned, why should [wd4,1-1] army which is made up of good people just do simple things "stand at attention", "right, left.... " day in day out. What's more, armies consisting of proffesional [fm1,-] work can provide soilder [fm1,-] [np6,1-2] a chance to take a job after he leave [vp3,1-] the army. Nowdays [fm1,-] a soilder [fm1,-] often becomes [wd,1-2] driver in a factory when he leave [vp3,1-] or just do [vp3,4-] nothing at all. I hope that oneday [fm2,-] they can do more than driving cars. Also in this way, patriotism will be served [cc3,3-] Because people do good to their country duing [fm1,-] peace time [cc1,-] and establish a better relationship between [wd4,1-2] army and [wd4,1-2] outside world [sn2,s-]  	I hope that world peace will come true. At that time military service will be a memorial [wd7,s-] just like today's imperial soilders [fm1,-] in Britain. Today, we can't give it up, but we can make it more valuable by setting up proffesions [fm1,-] It is only an ideal.  (t7-2)  	What is the responsibility of soldiers? Generally speaking, soldiers should fight against the intruders, which means the defence of their homeland, [sn9,s-] they are also expected to appear anywhere in emergency, which means the protection for [wd3,2-2] the people. [wd4,-2] Army plays an important role in a country's political life. Its development shows the power of the country. Since soldiers must be sufficient in number and practised in military training, there follows the military service.   There exists so-called compulsary [fm1,-] military service. Every year the country takes great effort in enrolling recruits, then uses much money and resource [np6,s-] to train them. In order to keep them in high spirited [wd2,2-] the country afford [vp3,2-1] much and ask [vp3,5-2] for little. But what happen next? When the service course is over, the soldiers have to find a job, which has nothing to do with their years of training, to make a living. Meanwhile, the country has to go back to the loop: enrolling, training new soldiers then let them go. Such great quality [wd3,2-2] of expenditure is a fairy [fm1,-] heavy burden on people. What's more, the war becomes cold and it is an age of high technology now, arm-to-arm fight will not appear any longer. The usage of high technology in national defence can well show one's military power. A large army is a white elephant now.   How to resolve this problem. The answer is: professional soldiers. Under certain circumstances, soldiering is regarded as [wd4,1-3] career and profession and an attractive job, [wd4,-3] regime should be sent [wd7,s-] and interview [np6,s-] should be held. Every recruit will have experienced fierce competion [fm1,-] before he joins the army. But as we know, being a soldier, one has the responsibility to go to the battle field whenever the country asks [cc3,s-] so he has the high rate of possibility of losing his life. That [wd5,s-] how to make the people devote their lives to the country willfully mainly depends on the patriotic education, then some irresistible temptation as [wd4,1-2] auxiliary part [wd7,s-] High payment and compensation are necessary and also high social position. Some privilege [cc3,s-] for example, no tax, should be given, too. Then to the individual, serving in the army is honourable and profitable. The country can keep a small in number [wd1,s-] but well-trained, [sn9,s-] crack troops [np3,7-] As to the people, their taxes can somewhat be lessened for the military budget goes down.   Judging by an international view, the system of military service should be abandoned, only the development of professional soldiers can keep abreast with the present rapidly changing world. But, from my own view, I heartily hope that in the coming future, "army" will disappear from daily life, "military service" and "soldier" are just old words [wd4,s-] appear [vp4,s-] in the historical story.  (t7-3)   Early in 600's B.C. a Chinese general had already found that frequent retirement of well-trained soldiers is a great problem. Because new-comers' combat effectioness [fm2,-] is much lower than that of well-trained soldiers. It would take a long time to train those newcomers. And this weakened the fighting capacity of the army greatly. Today this problem becomes more serious, for a modern soldier has more to grasp, it will take a longer time to train them.   So some persons with breadth of vision put forward [vp1,1-s-] that all armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers. The country will benefit a great deal if all armies are occupationized [fm2,-]   First, the troops will be better troops and the administration will be simpler administration. According to compulsory military service, the armies have to retire [vp1,-1]some soldiers each year and recruit some new ones, as I told [wd3,-]above this will weaken the armies' fighting capacity. In order to make up this, the armies must enlarge their establishment. But if we occupationize [fm2,-] the armies, we can make well-trained soldiers serve the armies for a very long time and the armies' fighting capacity will not be weakened for quite a long time. So there is no necessarity [fm2,-] to keep a very large establishment. This will save much money and many youngsters can get into the society and serve the development of the society.   It will also do good to the improvement of the armies' power. It is known to everybody that science and technology act [cc3,-4] a very important role in constructing armies. Without science and technology we can't invent new weapons and without scientific management the armies can't work effeciently [fm1,-] If we occupationize [fm2,-] the armies we will have more chances to qualify those professional soldiers, [sn9,s-] with high science and technology so that they can repair their high-tech arms and use them properly. Thus soldiers are no more fighting machines, they can think scientifically and know how to destroy the enemy effectively.   It can also give the armies more chances to select most [aj3,-1] excellent young people. The armies will have all levels of educational institutions that serve the armies.   Since all the soldiers are professional they will be more responsible to [aj2,1-1] their work and won't count [vp1,-s-] how many day [np3,2-] left [vp7,-] for him [pr3,s-] to stay in the army, just like some soldiers in today's army. This will help to build stable troops.   So according to what I had listed [vp6,s-] above military service had been [vp6,s-] an obstacle of the development of the armies. If the armies tend to make more progress professional soldiers are necessary. This is the only way, otherwise armies will not keep up with the progress of the whole society. But there will be much difficulty on the way to occupationizing [fm2,-] the armies just like reforms happening in other respects of the society. The course of seeking the success never did run smooth [wd2,2-] however it will succeed at last.  (t7-4)  	War is rather meaningless. It brings to mankind only [wd4,-4] bereavement of beloved ones, destroy [wd2,s-] of homeland and demoralization of spirits. There is no winner of a war. Both the two belligerent parties suffer tremendous pain. Many remarkable young men died on the battlefield while they might have offered their countries conspicuous contributions. Thus, we can't help doubting whether there is value in a system of military service which to some extent is the cause of misfortune to many people.  	Nowadays some countries adopt compulsory military services. Young men above a certain age should all enlist in the army not regarding [vp1,-s-] whether these young men are willing to be armymen [fm2,-] or not. Some may be glad to join [wd4,1-1] army. Some may strongly oppose being a soldier. Some may be fit for the task. Some may do much better if they take up other jobs. However, all these young men will be recruited provided they are healthy. The result is frustrating both to these young men and the military force.  	Because of the conscription policy, many talented young men have to give up their careers and interests to join the army, which change [vp3,s-] their fates greatly. I have an uncle who had been a top student in high school. He had wished to enter the best university in China and be eminent in the profession he chose. Everyone thought that he had enough ability to realize his ideal. Then he was recruited by the army. After three years of service, my uncle lost his opportunity of higher education and was assigned a post in a factory. Though he has a good job now, his regrets is lifelong. His and his fellow young men's regrets are also [wd4,s-] regrets of the country. Talents are the most precious treasure of a country.  	As to the army, it would not benefit from the compulsory military services either. It is easily understood that no man would give an excellent performance on a certain task if he dislikes it or even is compelled to do it. How can we expect young men who join the army strongly [wd5,3-3] against their wills [np5,2-] would take up their duties [cc3,3-] wholeheartedly. [sn9,s-] Moreover, the victory of a modern war depends more on advanced weapon [np6,4-] than [wd4,s-] the overwhelming amount of troops. It costs a vast amount of money to train new soldiers to master these weapons. When these young men become eligible armymen [fm2,-] and experts on these weapons two or three years later, they finish their terms of service and leave the army. The armies will have to spend the same amount of money training the recruits. The armies not only waste money but also have no well-trained soldiers. Both the morale and combat effectiveness are not high.  	The only way to solve all these problem [np3,1-] is that all armies should consist of professional soldiers. Only those who are willing to be soldiers will be soldiers and the country will have armies of high morale and fighting capacity. So why not adopt the professional military service system?  	The coming era is an era of peace and disarmament. Armymen's [fm2,-] duties will undertake [wd3,s-] a great change. Perhaps in the future, military forces will only play the role as [wd3,3-1] [wd4,1-1] defender of homeland and provider of help and aids. Armymen [fm2,-] may have a much longer service, which makes the professional service more compatible with the peace trend.  (t7-5) 	War is connected with blood and death. To civilians, it means parting with their dear ones or loss of them. War is a bitter story to all the people who had experienced [vp6,s-] it. Though we have a fairly peaceful world, the army still plays a very important role in states' military serviers [fm1,-] The instrument of armed force [np6,2-] and the threatened [aaj4,-3] or actual use of violence has been justified as a means of achieving greater control and predictability in the international system [wd7,s-] both [wd1,-6] in superpower countries and the others. Though there is a self-serving aspect to such a rationale, this function is still very evident. On the prospects of peace, the disarmament is paid so much attention to. But the different ways to consist [vp1,1-6] [cc3,-3] a state's army are neglected.   In unusual times, the compulsory military service is very practical and efficient. What about this in the peaceful times? Compulsory military service are [vp3,3-] still popular. All armies now should consist entirely of professional soldiers. There is no value in a system of [wd4,d] military. The enlisted compulsory people are inexprienced [fm1,-] soldiers. They have to learn everything from the beginning. Two or more years are needed for their training. Then they become skillful soldiers. They will go home after they finish their active service, if they are not sent to the front and die for the country. The experience about war they learned become [vp3,6-] of no use for making a living. Those [wd7,s-] move in circles to the new coming enlisted people. Veterans have to leave their training aside in the society. Why don't the states have professional soldiers to take [vp4,4-] the place of the compulsory ones? If the states do that, they will no longer need to enlist new soldier [np6,3-] and train them then sent [vp6,s-] them home. The wealthy [cc4,1-1] experience on war is a country's treasure. And the professional soldiers will have enough time and be more energetic to do their job better.   The world should be fair. Everyone should not be forced to choose a job. There are many people who dislike violence and hate the war. They prefer the mental work. How can a person do the job good [ad2,3-] if he dislike [vp3,1-] the job? Not all the enlisted soldiers are fit for training, because of their physical or mental standard. In some cases, we are [vp9,1-2] not have a perfect rationale about what we should do to the compulsory soldiers. Fiancials [fm1,-] and energies [np6,-] are wasted. The policy [np1,1-s-] to adopt professional soldiers will make some unemployed people find his [pr3,5-] job. And it will also be good news to the people who don't like to be the compulsory soldier. The adopting of professional soldiers [cc1,3-] can solve both the individual's and the society's problem.   To be away from the war disaster, to cherish the peace, the states should not consist [vp1,2-5] their armies of compulsory soldiers. To have a more specialized armed force, to be more democratic, the states should adopt the policy to have the professional soldiers. Then both the compulsory soldiers and the unemployed people will be glad to hear that.  (t7-6)   Our time is a changing time. Almost everything including culture, science, technology, agriculture are [vp3,s-] changing gradually. [wd4,-2] Military is not exceptional. Traditionally people think armies should consist of professional soliders [fm1,-] volunteer [np6,3-2] and compulsory soliders [fm1,-] so that sufficient solider [fm1,-] resource [np6,s-] is available. But nowdays [fm1,-] this kind of opinion seems to be out of time. The new opinion on this problem is that all armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers, there is no value in a system of military service.  	Although this new opinion seems to be still debatable, I think it is right. It fits the new time. There are several reasons which can show the problem's correctness.   Firstly, an army which consists entirely of professional army [wd6,7-] must have much more powerful fighting strength than the traditional armies have because the professional army men are more adept in the war. Fighting is their job, the way they make livings. They have to devote much time to studying military knowledge [cc3,2-] in order to make themselves act better on the battlefield. But traditionally compulsory soliders [fm1,-] can not have this kind of passion because most of them will retire in only several years. In other words, when these compulsory soliders [fm1,-] become experienced, it is time for them to retire. I think it is a waste of their experiences. But the professional soliders [fm1,-] do not have this kind of shortcoming [np6,3-] because they can stay in [wd4,1-1] army for a quite long time to make full use of their experiences. So professional soliders [fm1,-] must be more talented than the other kinds of soliders [fm1,-]   The second reason is that an army which consists entirely of professional soliders [fm1,-] can result [vp1,-s-] less [np8,-1] death [np6,s-] and wound [np6,3-3] on the battlefield. Nowdays [fm1,-] the main current of the world is peace and development. Many developed countries does [vp3,3-] not have many soliders [fm1,-] who are [vp6,s-s-] dead or wounded when they have to be involved in a war. Because if that happened [vp6,s-] the governments will have to face the pressure from their country [np3,s-] And those too many dead and wounded solider [fm1,-] [np3,4-] will give the anti-government parties a very good opptunity [fm1,-] to upset the present government. On the contray [fm1,-] if a country can win a war with very small [cc4,-1] casualties, the present government will win her citizens' hearts. For instance, the victory of the gulf war made president [fm3,-1] George Bush get a very high supporting rate. Since we know the professional soliders [fm1,-] are very skillful on the battlefield, they will have less possibility to be killed there. That is why they are welcome [wd3,-]to the governments.   Thirdly, the governments will spend quite [wd4,1-3] great amount of money on [wd3,6-1] training the new soliders [fm1,-] Since we know that every several years the compulsory soliders [fm1,-] will retired [vp9,1-] But if the army consists entirely of professional soliders [fm1,-] this amount of money will be greatly saved. It's also the advantage of professional soliders [fm1,-]   According to the three reasons above, we can know that the army which consists of professional soliders [fm1,-] is superior to the traditional army indeed. I also think it's [wd7,s-] the main current of the future military's reform.  (t7-7)  Many officers said that all armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers, [sn9,s-] there is no value in a system of military service. Many countries were planning [vp1,1-s-] building the armies with the professional soldiers. And some armies became weaker and weaker, because they were in the system of military service [wd7,s] Why could the professional soldiers make the army strong? What is the shortcoming of the military service?  First, professionalizing [fm1,-] can cover the shortage of the soldiers. In most countries, people were forced to join the army by the power. So the soldiers were not willingly [wd2,2-2] to stay in [wd4,1-1] army. Some of them escaped. And many young people refused to join [wd4,1-1] army. They played tricks. So some armies were always short of soldiers. If soldier [wd2,s-] [cc2,-3] become [vp3,2-] a profession, and people can get high salary [np6,2-] from the army, lots of people will volunteer to join [wd4,1-1] army. Since the soldiers in the system of military service were not willingly [wd2,2-2] to be soldiers, they would not train hard or fight bravely only for the low pay. On the other hand, if it is a job, the soldier has to perform well. It decided [vp6,d] the salary and the rank, [sn9,s-] hundreds [wd4,1-1] years ago, in Europe, French armies consisted of professional soldiers [sn1,s-] The French government gave them high salary [np6,3-] So the men from Germany, Italy, Spain were eagerly [wd2,2-2] to join these armies. Lots of strong men which [pr5,s-] couldn't be got [vp7,-] in France were ranked in these armies. So the French Armies were powerful at that time. They defeated many other European countries. France beniffited [fm1,-] from the professional soldiers.   The other reason is that the term of military service are [vp3,5-] usually short. It may be three or four years. The young men joined the Army. They had no knowledge of the war, the weapen [fm1,-] and the skill. So they had to be taught during the first two years. After the hard training, they could just be a real soldier [np3,6-] But after one or two years their service will end. So the army had to enrol [fm1,-] new soldier [np6,2-] and the training had to begin again. It costed [fm2,-] much to train the soldiers. And the army were [vp3,3-] always full of fresh soldiers. So the army was not so strong. But if the soldiers are professional, they only need to be trained once. Their experience and skill will become perfect more and more [wd1,s-] as the time pass [vp3,2-] by. So the army's members are all well trained. Of course, it will be powerful.   So the army's professionalization [fm1,-] can make the best use of every valuable man and valuable thing. But the military service wasted a lot, it hurted [fm2,-] the personal right. The armies should be professionalized [fm1,-] If it does [vvp7,d] it will be strong.  (t7-8)   Nowadays, with the USSR's division into pieces, the Eastern European Socialist Republics' [fm3,4-] changing institutions [cc3,1-] and the intense Trade Combat [fm3,3-] between USA and Japan, the world's situation is in fierce turbulence. The tactic stress in the world has moved to economy from [wd4,1-1] military [wd3,s-] Accordingly each country begins to revise the strategic decisions. Here, I have a suggestion about the military reform --- All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers. There is no value in a system of military service.   In the last few years, USA --- who are always skilled in military enlargement and aggression, reduced the military personnel to the minimize [wd2,2-] Why? The huge expensive [wd2,2-2] had been a heavy burder [fm1,-] on the goverment's [fm1,-] treasury. Too many unnessary [fm1,-] idlers seriously baffled the whole system's efficient exertion and the soldiers [np4,1-1] enthusiasm. The personnel's cutting became the inevitable result. On the other hand, the army makes greater endeavor in the research of the guided missles [fm1,-] and nuclear weapon [np6,2-] etc. All this has showed us --- with the shift of the strategical [fm1,-] stress and the development of advanced technology, the modern force demands to be highly modernized, centralized and mechanized, the military talents or even the soldiers are also demanded [vp1,4-s-] to be the personnel in some specific fields. It can not be imagined that only the sacrifice of a great number of lives can exchange [vp7,s-] for the success. What the modern war needs is not the foot soldiers who have face-to-face fight [np6,s-] but powerful weapons and the professional personnel. This is to be bound to be the common tendency.   Beside this, the existence of the military service is unnecessary. Can you imagine that a soldier, who is compulsory to [wd3,3-] the battle and does not know the meaning of war, the task on him, can fight heroically? No. Is the "Parade step, march!" very useful in the modern fight? No. Then the goverment [fm1,-] spends a great amount of money, energies and time to train [vp5,s-] the compulsory soliders [fm1,-] and two or three years later, the goverment [fm1,-] let them retire from military service and go home. What is this for? To stimulate the people's patriotism? Maybe it is, but there are still many others [wd2,1-2] better ways to develop the patriotism. I think the military service is just a kind of waste on money, time and energies. If the youngsters spend the precious time in the fields which they are more interested in, the achievement may be glorious, not just staying in the army and doing nothing. And, if the goverment [fm1,-] can save more time, money and energies on [wd3,s-] the research of new weapons and on [wd3,s-] the soldiers who have noble aspirations to the military career and are voluntary to take it as a [np7,-1] undertaking, isn't it more worthwhile? The soldiers can receive the professional training and the youngmen [fm2,-] can have more time in the studying which they are interested in. Does it satify [fm1,-] both side [np3,1-] ?   So, I think, to adapt to the change of the world's situation, the soldiers should be professional and the system of military service should be canceled --- the existence of military service has no value.  (t7-9)   The system of military service has been outdated in our society. Professional soldiers should take the place of compulsory soldiers.   In modern wars, the importance of the number of soldiers has been weakened since more and more electronic, optical and atomic technologies are put into use. In ancient times, if an army had a great number of soldiers, several gallant generals and a group of farseeing advisers, there would be no problem to get [wd5,1-1] win. It is obvious that at that time, the amount of soldiers was a very important factor on [wd3,1-] deciding an army's fate. In ancient China, most armies consisted of soldiers who did not have any knowledge on warfare. In fact, many of them were just farmers before they entered armies. They were only required to shoot arrows and brandish swords or spears. Nowadays, the situation is different. A soldier's skill is not just shooting, but also operating machines including computers, equipped vehicles, and all kinds of modern weapons. All modern wars need high technology, and high technology needs professional soldiers. So a qualified professional soldier is also a qualified expert in a certain field of military science. It is impossible for a compulsory soldier to grasp military technology and practise perfectly in a limited service term. So we can draw a conclusion that compulsory soldiers do not suit modern wars. In the Gulf War, for example, advanced military technology gave full play during the whole fight course. All of us have seen the power of high technology. Though there were still compulsory soldiers undertaking their duties in the war, we can easily find that advanced technology and equipment are far more important than a huge group of unprofessional soldiers. We have enough reasons to believe that someday in the future, all armies have a lot of high-level equipment and a group of professional soldiers who are able to undertake all duties in modern wars.   But now, most countries put [wd4,1-4] military service system into practice. I don't think this is good for a country. First of all, every country spends a great deal of money to support [vp5,s-] its military researches and army supply. Since the outlay is limited, if army supply takes more, the military researches have to take less, and the military development will get slower and slower. The system of military service is actually a waste of social wealth. It is unnecessary to spend a large amount of money to provide [vp5,s-] numerous compulsory soldiers' board, lodging, and salaries. And the [wd5,1-1] second, for compulsory soldiers themselves, they have to stop leading normal lives for several years, [wd4,s-] maybe they have to give up their favorate [fm1,-] professions just because of military service. It is undoubted that military service is actually a waste of talent.   After all, the system of military service is just a product of a certain phase of warfare history. As time goes on, it will be replaced by [wd4,d] more effective system. Only professional soldiers have the ability to deal with all complex situations in the modern wars. We have no reason to remain undecided [aj1,1-6] to go with the general trend.  (t7-10)   We often read some reports from the front that some soldier died eighteen or some soldier sacrificed his life just several days after he joined the army. We are always in deep sorrow and pity when reading them, because they were so young. At the same time we also see a problem in [wd4,1-2] military service.   In China, the compulsory military service lasts from two to four years. During this period, young men, sometimes just out of high school, are trained to be qualified soldiers. Great effort should be made to train a good soldier, both to the instructor and the instructed [wd7,s] The soldiers should suffer patiently from the intense, tiresome training and the boring, restricted life. They should also master the necessary military theories. Usually when they are well trained to be qualified soldiers, it is almost the last period of military service and they should prepare to leave the army. So the real situation is that armies keep on training unexperienced youngsters as well as losing qualified soldiers.   When those experienced soldiers domobilize [ffm1,-] they find it difficult to work and live well. Because they were trained to be soldiers, not workers, peasants, salesmen or executives. Fighting has never been regarded as a real profession. If soldiers want to earn a living, they must take something else as a job. Why can't they live on as professional soldiers?   Then what happens on the front? Only a few in armies are professional soldiers. Armies are lacking of [wd3,2-2] experienced soldiers when wars break out and go on. To the army, enough amount of professional soldiers can to some extent improve the fighting capacity and reduce unnecessary casulties [fm1,-] A professional military leader can organise his soldiers to attack or defend better than a nonprofessional one. A professional soldier knows more about how to protect himself and destroy the adversary. An army consisting entirely of professional soldiers can move more quickly, fight more effectively, coordinate more harmoniously. Unfortunately, what [wd5,s-] the fact it [wd5,2-2] is that armies can not obtain enough professional soldiers, and have to use those unexperienced [fm1,-] ones. They are too young to know how to attack and defend well, so they compose most of the casualties in any war. Yet they have to fight, because the military service let [vp3,4-] those experienced soldiers go and do [vp3,s-] not allow them to take [wd4,2-2] professional position in armies. Also some casulties [fm1,-] and failures are caused by some unexperienced leaders. Maybe they were just think [vp9,3-] about what to do after their mobilization while the battle was going on and proper instructions were greatly [cc5,-1] needed.   To win every battle, all armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers. Only in this way, can armies obtain enough qualified military leaders and soldiers. Only in this way, can leaders use their previous experience to serve for a coming battle. Only in this way, can soldiers get [wd3,2-3] full use of their military trainings [np5,2-] and survive and win a battle. Only in this way can all soldiers settle their mind at their profession in armies. So there is no longer any value in a system of military service.  (t7-11)   The 20'th century saw professionalization [fm1,-] established itself as a world trend. In sports, football, basketball and rugby are all worldly professionalized [fm1,-] In business, almost all positions are assigned to persons that specialize in specific fields. On [wd4,1-1] stage, many previously [wd2,1-1] amateurs turned [vp6,d] to professionals out of histrionic devotion or merely to make more money. Why not military forces?   For a long time, compusory [fm1,-] service has been the main military practice in many countries. That would require all the eligible males to serve, [sn9,s-] the army, navy or airforce for a fixed term before demobilization. Then those veterans are substituted by the next batch of recruits. This kind of cycling system --- I have to admit, [sn9,s-] had its merits and practicability in the old days indicated [wd3,-] by the following quotation from Mao Tse-tung, "If all the people are mobilized to defend our country, the invaders will be engulfed into a 'war of [wd4,2-1] mass [wd3,s-] '. No matter how strong and vicious they seem to be, perishing is their only destination." Nevertheless, this concept is out-dated now with the fast development of weapons and war strategies. The significence [fm2,-] of ' [wd4,1-2] war of [wd4,2-1] mass [wd3,2-] ' is diminishing in a modern war, superceded by the emphasis on scientific and technological applications [np5,s-] on [wd3,1-] the military capacities. The belligerent that possesses more sophisticated warring [wd3,s-] facilities along with personnels [np5,-] that can operate them skillfully is more likely to manipulate the balance against its rivals [wd7,s-]  Professionalization [fm1,-] is just in tide with [pp1,-] this military trend. Graduates from military academies are supposed to be experts on weapons and strategies. They are able to operate conventional facilities as well as modern equipment. After several years in service, they will also gain enough practical knowledge. An army composed of such highly-skilled soldiers is presumably advantageous over [wd4,1-s-] one that is made up of new-recruited [fm2,-] green-hands, thus more reliable to be dispatched [wd7,s]  Another outstanding characteristic of modern war is the underlining of readiness. Professionalization [fm1,-] enables forces to be arrayed at any time when emergency arose [vp6,s-] As to a compulsory system, soldiers and other military personnels [np5,-] have to be called upon from scattered places before an army is ready. That would cost a lot of precious time during a war.   What's more, professionalization [fm1,-] relieves non-professionals from practising military services. Thus saves a lot of money and instructing personnels [np5,-] while at the same time makes them concentrate more on other fields [sn2,s-]   All these impress us that it is time to adopt a new military policy in response to the drastically changed world. Like many countries that have accepted professionalization [fm1,-] initiating such a policy will in the long run, strengthen our national-defence, [sn9,s-] as well as benefit all of us.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH SJD> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (t8-1)   Peace is the most beautiful word in this world. It is the symbol of happiness, wealth, and might. On the contrary, war symbols pain, poverty, and death. It is the most evil thing in this world. In history, people had suffered from wars. They lost their relations, friends, families, properties... Wars bring great miseries to them. So, people need peace, they desire for [wd3,1-] it, pray for it. "peace" [fm3,s-] they shout it in their heart [sn5,s-]   "War is hating," they claim that [wd5,s-] Violence, arms strength should not be used. They think in an ideal way that all disputes shoud [fm1,-] be settled in a peaceful way. But, in the [pp2,1-1] fact, many contradictions are too complex to be solved by negociation [fm1,-] As a result, they are solved by force in the final [wd3,2-] It is not a good way, but there is no better choice.   Everyone loves a peaceful life and tries one's best to get it. How to lead such a life? It must has [vp9,1-] a powerful basis -- an undepending [fm2,-] sovereign. People love peace, at the same time, they should love their countries first. They should do anything for their countries, even fighting [vp4,s-] for it. People can live in peace only if their countries is [vp3,2-] peaceful, and prosperous.   The Gulf War is an example to prove that. The war happened in [wd4,1-2] middle-east area. the [fm3,-s-] fuse was sparkled by Iraq's invading Kuwait. After Iraq refused the warning from UN, the UN peaceful [wd3,2-1] troop leaded [fm2,-] by America made a sudden and violent attrack [fm1,-] to [wd3,1-1] Iraq. Then Iraq surrended [fm1,-] without any requirement. The UN troop won the war quickly and completely. Kuwait began to rebuilt [vp4,1-] its ruins [cc3,2-]   The war had [vp6,s-] finished for a long time, but people all over the world still have different opinions about the controversial fight. The main arguement [fm2,-] is whether it is justice [wd2,s-] or not.   In my view, it is justice [wd3,d] The Gulf War has shown us that it is still a great thing to fight for one's country. Iraq's invading is immoral. The UN troop helps Kuwait to keep its sovereign. The war is not an invading war. Kuwait people have the right to lead a peaceful life. Iraq has no right to deprive [vp1,-1] it. Iraq was damaged greatly in the bombs [wd3,s-] Maybe, it seems miserable to Iraqi. That is the punishment for what they had done.   War is merciless. But, as a sequence [wd7,s-] people have chances to lead a new life, a peaceful life. Therefore, people should fight for one's [pr3,s-] country, for its peaceful prospects.  (t8-2)   Half a centry [fm1,-] ago, Hitler's tyranny, invasion and persecution aroused the passion of people to fight for freedom, to fight against Nazi's ambition. But decades later, it puzzled many people that is it [wd1,s-] an honor to fight for one's mother-land now? [sn8,-]The answer is yes.   The whole world's peace, which has been dreamed for centries [fm1,-] [sn9,s-] has not arrived [vp1,2-3] our wounded earth. There are still injustice, tyranny, religious conflicting and ambition which will result in bleeding someday. One may not refuse to say yes when his nation is on the rim [cc1,-2] of war. He will pick up his gun and fight until the country's interest is safe. The Saudi Arabia was afraid of being attacked by Iraq for religious craziness. It have [vp3,1-] [vp6,s-] to protect itself from being the second Kuwait. So the Saudi Arabia gave its connection [wd7,s-] when American [np6,s-] wanted to station [vp1,2-1] there but asked the American to garantee [fm1,-] its retreat after the destroyment [fm2,-] of the [wd5,1-1] Iraq. No foreign troop could stay after finishing the task.   But why American people would [wd1,s-] like to spend such a large amount of money and fly their soldiers to such a [np7,-1] isolated and dry desert? Why did some young man [np3,2-] recruit [vp7,s-] to fight away from home? For justice? Maybe, but not the whole story [sn8,s-] They are [vp6,d] fighting for their country's interest, too. Although [wd5,s-] America provided [cc3,-2] its privilege to [wd3,3-1] Iraq years ago, but if Sadam had fullfilled [fm1,-] his ambition, the American economy would have been shakened [fm2,-] because [wd4,1-5] the increasing price of oil. If the Iraqi government takes control of the oil in the Persian area, the Japanese, French, British people will all have a bad dream. Japan, which is lack [wd2,2-2] of resources, has to rely on inporting [fm2,-] oil from abroad. Had it not been for its constitution, Japan, an important financial aider [sn9,s-] may have trooped abroad. Everyone was fighting for the country's interest and felt it completely necessary to do so, otherwise something may be lost there.   For the lraqi [fm1,-] people, they also went to war to protect their interest. It's not a shame for them to fight, on the contrary it's an honor. Some thought that they were the only descendants of that huge ancient country and the [wd5,1-2] Kuwait belongs [vp6,s-] to them. Some just couldn't ignor [fm1,-] the great wealth they may [vp6,s-] get from the [wd5,1-1] Kuwait. They can [vp6,s-] get the oil, more oil means [vp6,s-] more money; they can [vp6,s-] get rid of the $20 billion debt; they will [vp6,s-] become the strongest country there. Others had to accept the war because [wd4,s-] the UN's sanction and appoaching [fm1,-] their land [wd7,s-] They fought since they didn't want to be destroyed. They were isolated so they had to fight, to protect themselves against the domineering force. They had no other choice.  Although there is [vp3,-s-] justice and injustice in the world affair [np6,s-] a man sometimes has no choice but to fight for his country and accepts it as a great thing.  (t8-3)   In the small hours of Aug. 2, 1990, when 1,900,000 Kuwaiti people were still in their sound sleep, the God of War befell their homeland. Only one night, Iraq conquered its rich neighbour --- Kuwait. The incident brought about immediate oppositions and blames [np5,3-] of the international community. The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution of economic sanction [np6,4-] and arms embargo [np6,2-2] against Iraq. Military confrontation between Iraq and the multinational forces soon came into being. Many efforts had been made to attempt to resolve the Gulf Crisis; however, the failure of the final peace negotiation touched off the so-called Gulf War. The war was at last ended with the defeat of Iraq and the liberalization [fm2,-] of Kuwait. The Gulf War has shown us that it is still a great thing to fight for one's own country.   Although Kuwait only had a small military force of 20,000, they still fought valiantly to protect their homeland. Five fighters took off in time to block forty Iraqi fighters. A soldier shot down a [np7,-1] Iraqi armed helicopter with a gun. The fate of their country then dwarfed [cc3,-3] their own lives.   Paradoxically, it was also a great thing for Iraqi soldiers to fight for their own country, because only by war could they fulfill their long cherished desires: one is to expand their territory, the other is to loot wealth. Before 1963 Iraq had long claimed its sovereignty over Kuwait, because Iraq regarded itself as the sole heritor of the Osman Empire. More important [wd2,s-] Iraq had lost some $200 billion during its war with Iran, and owed Kuwait $20 billion. Iraq sought to reverse [cc3,-3] its foreign debt with Kuwait, because it saw [vp1,-s-] itself the hero of the whole Arabian world. In addition, Iraq's oil reserves could have reached 20% of the world gross reserves, if it had devoured Kuwait. That was the dream of Iraq.   Then, why did America bother to fight for Kuwait? There were inner causes that accouted [fm1,-] for its action. As we all know, 26.4% of [wd4,1-2] American oil exports were from Middle East and thereby Middle East had a great bearing on its national economy. If Iraq merged Kuwait, the oil price was [vp6,s-] inevitably monopolized by Iraq. And that was exactly what America didn't want to see. So how could Uncle Sam sit and watch without rescuing? Therefore, American soldiers also fought for their own country's profits.   Like all other wars that ever occurred in human history, the Gulf War showed the world again: it is always an honor to fight for one's own country.  (t8-4)  	Since the cold war between the east [fm3,-s-] and [wd4,s-] west [fm3,-s-] ended, the world have [vp3,2-] become rather peaceful. Most countries in the world focuse [fm1,-] on the economical development. People seldom think of the war full of blood and smoke of gunpowder. They have been used to living peacefully. The war is far away, they think. However, the break [wd3,1-4] of the Gulf War woke up their consciences. While seeing that the Iraqi army savaged the Kuwaiti land and destroyed its people's lives, every one realised that it was still a great thing to fight for one's country.  	A country belongs to its people and vice versa. The country is set up by its founders. It becomes more and more prosperous due to the people's hard working [wd2,5-] On the grounds people build up their families. They raise their children, look after their parents and love their husbands or wives. There they achieve their dreams. They can do all these things because they have their country to defend their human rights. In the international affairs, a country represents its people to announce [vp5,s-] the requests and views. They are connected with each other so tightly that they can't be separated just for one minute.  	In face of the war, we have but one aim, [sn9,s-] to destroy the enemy. During the Gulf War, the Kuwaiti [np3,-1] have been carrying [vp6,s-] out various kinds of struggle [np3,4-] against the Iraqi army. Some heroes died for their country. The whole world was deeply moved by their patriotic spirit. I can't imagine Kuwait would have got freedom without the Kuwaiti's struggle and appeal for the international support.  	It was the blood-lust and hateful appetities [fm1,-] that compelled the Iraqi cruel ruler to launch the Gulf War. In order to get the oil and the coast line which is the fortress in the Middle East from Kuwait, the Iraqi had begun to plan the invasion adventure several years before. This reminds me of the second world war. Hitler dreamed of being the ruler of the whole world. The Nazi regime treated the conquered countries and people with great savagery. Certainly this resulted in the internationwide [fm2,-] condemnation. Just as what Churchill had said in his famous speech, "we shall fight him by land, we shall fight him by sea, we shall fight him in the air, until, with God's help, we have rid the earth of his shadow and liberated its peoples from his yoke." The people fought bravely and succeeded at last. The Nazi regime was completely destroyed. Some Nazi bigwigs, including Hitler, committed suicide; some fled away, the rest were sentenced to death. The same was the Iraqi power policy. It was beaten bitterly by the United Nations' army. Finally the Iraqi army withdrew from Kuwait. It was also punished severely by the international laws.  	The war will never end. In the modern world, it still exists somethere [fm2,-] in [wd3,-s-] the earth. The super countries are staring at the other countries' fertile land in every minute. They want to achieve their expanding-plan [fm2,-] to satisfy their huge appetities [fm1,-] As the Gulf War has showned [fm2,-] us [wd5,s-] we must know that the independence of our mother countries is most important as if a child can not lose its parents [sn4,s] Once one's country is invaded, every one should devote all his (or her) energy, money and even life to the liberty of the country. Never forget the war. Never forget to depend [wd3,-] our countries, the familiar land where we were brought up.  (t8-5)  The Gulf War has passed for almost two years. In some people's mind, the war was just past, like smoke going with the wind and left nothing here. But at that area where this war happened, it can not be forgotten so easily. The hurt needs time to heal; the destroyed soil needs to be rebuilt. And something does still exist in one's mind, that is [sn9,s-] the thought of guarding his country even to fight [vp5,s-] for his country.   The love of his country, or patriotism, is not a nobel [fm1,-] thought. It is the basic, almost instinctive reaction of human being [np6,2-] when he (or she) knows that his country is in great trouble. During the American Civil War, it was not the slavery question that persuaded General Lee to join the confederate army, but an entirely different consideration, one that was close to his heart --- his native state. Lee himself did not believe in slavery and did not own any slaves. He was a Virginian; and as he saw it, a citizen's primary duty was loyalty to his home, ---to the state in which he was born. With [wd4,1-2] greatest regret, he extended [cc3,-2] his resignation to [wd3,-4] the United States Army, in which he had served proudly and honorably for many years. So did many other honorable, patriotic Southeners [fm1,-] We may not agree with [wd3,1-2] their decision, none can question their honest conviction of where they thought their duty lay.   To fight for one's country is every one's duty, no matter [wd4,2-5] sex, race, social level, or vocation. Your country is a place, where you were born, where you have grown up; a place where your root lies; a place called "home". To lose your country means losing [sn6,s-] your home, your root. In the past you will [vp6,s-] become others' slavery [wd3,s-] nowadays you will become a tramper from nation to nation without rest [wd7,s] Though you can have your house, family in other countries, it is not really your home, you are rootless.   How could a son abandon his mother! So as [sn2,1-2] the same, how could an honest man abandon his country. Before the Second World War, in China, we also had a war, the war between Mao Tustong and Jiang Kaishik. When Japanese invaded our country, when our country was in danger, the war between Mao and Jiang ceased, all the Chinese united together to fight for their country, until we expelled the invaders. Why? Mao and Jiang were totally against each other. How could they allied together to fight? Because, [sn9,s-] the patriotism, the fright of losing our country propelled them to fight against the invaders, though [wd5,s-] no matter how [pr5,2-4] greatest [aj3,1-3] difference between them.  The Gulf War has shown us that it is still a great thing to fight for one's country. To the further [cc4,-1] extent, not only the Gulf War but every war between two countries can show us this. And it is not the question of "Still". There is always a great thing to fight for one's country, if he is honorable and patriotic!  (t8-6)   The Gulf War showed that the United States tried to be the master of the world once more. Iraq has always improved [vvp6,s-] its great military power in the past. The II [wd3,1-2] world war and the Vietnam war [fm3,2-] had shown [vp6,d] that kind of countries' ambition.   Though today's economy is the most important factor [np1,-5] to built [vp5,1-] a powerful nation, power politics is still alive. When we denounced the action of Iraq vigorouly [fm1,-] we're also shown [vp7,s-] that all of the Kuwait people depent [fm1,-] their country bravely. Patriotism was 'shinning' [fm2,-] again.   It appeared that Iraq would succeed if the U.N. had not stopped it. But no one could help Kuwait, if it submitted itself to Iraq at first.   Several years ago, a country with nuclear weapon [np6,2-] seemed mere [wd2,1-4] secure and powerful. Military power was more like a politic weapon. U.S.A  had always competed with U.S.S.R. in [wd4,1-1] military [pp1,1-] It seemed that security and development connected [vp7,s-] with wars. Today, it's said that all of these weapons will destory [fm1,-] the earth in a moment for several times [wd7,s] Then what can defend our country? I think it's still the human being [np6,s-] All the members are certainly the soul of the group.   Science is highly developed, new weapon [np6,1-1] can be produced every second. It had been proved [vp6,s-] that no one could be the master of the world by [wd4,1-1] military. Iraq had biochemical weapon [np6,1-] and it could destroy all the people in Kuwait for a while, [wd4,s-] [sn9,s-] why did it still suffer a defeat? Since it standed [fm2,-] against the people unhold [vp4,s-] justice [sn2,s-]   U.N.'s help is a result of the sense of justice. Though America's participation in the U.N. Army was important, but [wd5,s-] it's not necessary. The most necessary factor, which defeat [vp6,s-] [cc1,s-] Iraq, was the Kuwait's people. Patriotic spirit still influenced the people when Iraq had seized [vp6,s-] Kuwait.  	In [wd4,1-2] modern society, patriotism is widely shown in every area. Olympics [wd2,-1] Games always get [vp3,3-] us exciting [aj4,s-] but it also builds a lot of heroes [cc3,4-] There are still many 'fights' for one's country. When he got [wd4,s-] medal, the winner's eyes were full of tears, with his country's flag rising [pp1,5-] These phenomena is [vp3,2-] still a great thing.  	The military has been equally violent in today's world. But fight for one's country is still a great thing [wd7,s-]  (t8-7)   In [wd3,-2] January 15th, of [wd5,3-1] 1991, Gorge Bush, the president of the United States, ordered the American air force attacked [vp4,5-2] the goals in Iraq. Many western countries involved [vp7,s-] in the war, because they wanted to protect their own benefits in the gulf. The middle east [fm3,s-] had so many [np8,1-1] oil and in [wd4,-2] modern world, the prices for the oil effected the industries of many countries very much. The western industrial countries were all dependent on foreign energy, particularly foreign oil. But, the prices for the foreign oil were increasing daily. They had to do something to stop it because someday they may not be able to get the oil. Therefore, the westerners were very warm-hearted to punish Iraq.   Although the gulf war has been ended [vp7,3-] for about two years, we can still learn much from it. The gulf war has shown us that it is still a great thing to fight for one's country. As a citizen, one has the resposibility [fm1,-] to fight for one's country, because the citizens [wd4,s-] just like the organs of [wd4,1-2] human body, and the country is a person [wd7,s-] If the person is ill or dead, the organs must be hurt. Therefore, one can not have nothing to do with one's country. To be patriotic is a primary need of a citizen. A good man is the one that can sacrifice one's personal interests for others. But, a person who fight [vp3,3-] for the country is more respectable and regarded as a real hero. In the past two hundred years Chinese [wd4,s-] suffered a lot from foreign invasion. All the Chinese know that one should fight for his country when it is invaded. During the [wd5,1-3] world war [fm3,3-1] II, Japan had invaded [vp6,s-] China. But, Chinese [wd4,s-] never gave up their resistance. Millions of Chinese soilders [fm1,-] died and they are [vp6,s-] real patriots. At that time, the arms of [wd4,1-1] Japanese were more advanced than those of Chinese soilders [fm1,-] But, Chinese [wd4,s-] did not fear their enemy. They tried to defend every inch of their land. [wd4,s-] Never gave up a city and a town. Thousands of officers received the order, "If you can not prevent the Japanese, die with the town." So many Chinese generals died. Not because they had made mistakes just because their armies were lack [wd2,s-] of bullets, corns [np5,-] water, and clothes. All they had were only red hearts. They used their hearts to protect their country. When the bullets were out of use [wd7,s-] soilders [fm1,-] used spades and stones, every tool to fight against invaders. At that time, no one would think over whether it was worthy. To fight against [wd4,3-2] Japanese was quite a simple choice just like people should eat and drink. No one was willing to see that the flags of the invaders was [vp3,s-] hung on their motherland. Although at that time China was regarded as an undeveloped country. Chinese were quite sure about their resposibility [fm1,-] that they should defend their homeland.   Whatever it is [vp6,s-] in the past, the present or the future, no one will doubt about [vp1,s-] that it is a great thing to fight for one's country.  (t8-8)  The summer in 1990 was a very special one because a modern war which stired [fm2,-] the whole world broke out at the Gulf on 2nd, Autumn. When the hot blast has [vp6,s-] just lifted and Kuwaitis have [vp6,s-] just fallen asleep, Iraqi army launched a surprise attack upon Kuwait, and [wd4,s-] multilateral army has since stationed troops at the Gulf. Why did the Iraqi leader order attack suddenly? Why did so many strong western countries pay so much attention to a war just between two small countries? It's not because the high temperature made these VIP [np3,1-] hot head [fm2,4-] It's because that [wd5,s-] it is still a great thing to fight for one's country.  The reason why Iraq dispatched troops lies in three disputes between Kuwait and Iraq. One is about the oil policy. Both of them want to cash in on the oil as much as possible. The other [wd3,d] is [wd4,1-3] border dispute which is also very universal [wd3,-] between other countries in the world. The last one is [wd4,1-3] dispute over obligation. The war between Iraq and Iran has made Iraq run into debt. After the war, [wd4,-3] Iraqi people need [vp6,d] to recuperate and multiply. And the country faced the hard task of postwar reconstruction. But they had no money. Iraq had to find a way to develop the economy. Prosperous Kuwait [cc4,1-] just like a piece of meat [ad1,s-] [sn9,s-s-] has make [vp9,1-] [vp6,s-] him [pr1,s-] drool with envy for a long time.   Since Iraq fought for the development of his country [sn2,s-] How about Kuwait and these westen [fm1,-] countries? Of course Kuwaitis fought a just war. They protest [wd3,d] [vp6,d] their homeland bravely. They hated these invaders. They recalled their happy lives. So many kinds of rebellion spreaded [fm2,-] [cc3,-3] the whole country quickly, first demonstration [np6,s-] then the street fighting and at last the city guerrilla war. There were many lebanese [fm3,1-2] and Palestinian [np6,2-1] live [vp4,s-] in Kuwait. They had no [sn8,1-2] own country and took Kuwait as their home. Naturally they would stood [vp9,1-] on Kuwaiti's side and took part in protesting [wd3,s-] their homeland bravely. As [wd4,s-] the same, these big countries, no matter what their real purpose [np3,2-1] were, all fought for the sake of their own interest. This is doubtless [wd2,2-1] true.   I think fighting for one's country is understandable. Since everyone wants to have a roof to live under and nobody would like to be controlled and oppressed by others, all want to live in a peaceful environment. In history, Jews were forced to leave home and wander about. They had to scatter everywhere and became the world refugee [np3,s-] They suffered with the agony for they had no country, no home. The extreme [wd2,-2] upset feeling impelled them to fight almost forty years to establish and protest [wd3,s-] their own country. With the devolopment [fm1,-] of the third-world countries, the difference between strong countries and week ones decreased every day. Every country has his [wd3,3-] own dignity. Whatmore [fm2,-] the patriotic education make [vp3,3-] everyone regard his homeland as a part of his life. They could devote [vp1,-s-] all his [pr3,4-] possession to defend [wd4,1-2] state sovereignty and national honor which have close relation to [wd3,1-2] their happy lives.   Then since every country has the right to defend his [wd3,s-] own dignity, fighting for one's country must have a limit. May I suggest that every country should develop himself [wd3,s-] by the science and technology, not the war?  (t8-9)  	Do you still remember the Gulf War which broke out in 1990 with Iraq's invading Kuwait and ended in 1991 with Iraq's being defeated by the United Nations forces. [sn9,s-] Though the war was over two years before [wd3,s-] Kuwait and Iraq are still suffering from it. Kuwait has to resettle all its habitants, for, [sn9,s-] a good many [wd3,-]of people fled from Kuwait when the war carried [vp7,s-] on, and Iraq is still busy rebuilding its seriously damaged country. Kuwait has once been completely conquered by Iraq. If it had not been for the UN forces that saved it, it would have been a part of Iraq and be bullyed [fm2,-] and oppressed by the conqueror. Why Kuwait [wd1,s-] was almost subjugated? I think it is because Kuwait was too weak to defend itself against the relatively powerful Iraq. If it had been equally powerful as Iraq, Iraq would have only aggressed against it's [wd3,-3] boundary and gained nothing but resistance. [sn8,s]The war showed us that it is still a great thing to fight for our country to retain security.  	Though the major tendency of our present world is "peace and development", it is necessary indeed to prepare our country for war. There are so many conflicts between countries that the war of small or larger [wd2,3-] occurred [vp6,s-] here and there almost everyday [fm2,s-] What causes the conflicts are [vp3,s-] usually the possession of natural resources. An oil field on the boundary between Iraq and Kuwait was the fuse of the Gulf War. And most of the boundary wars were launched for the purpose of land. There are also many potential wars for the independence and self-government of some nations in former Jugoslavia and former Soviet Union countries. Although the negotiational [fm2,-] methods have priority in dealing with the world affairs, there are many conflictions [fm2,-] which can not be compromised and are most likely to cause wars.	  	Since the world is not so stable under the peaceful surface, we must prepare ourselves for war and when war break [vp3,1-] up [vp2,s-] we should be able to fight against our enemy to defense [vp5,1-2] our country. If we cannot, we will be easily bullyed [fm2,-] and oppressed by powerful countries. When Kuwait was conquered, the oil wells were all seized by Iraq and countless properties were taken away. And when Iraq withdrawn [fm2,s-] the soldiers damaged most of the oil plants and lit fire [np3.-3] on the oil wells, which caused great lost [fm1,-] to Kuwait. It was because Kuwait was too weak that it failed to prevent Iraq from doing that bad. In China's Qing Dynasty, the similar things happened. At that time, the corruption and incompetence of the government caused the weakness of the country. Then the big powers began to bully China. They imposed the Opiom [fm1,-] Wars onto Chinese people. Although Chinese people fought bravely against them, they always defeated China because they were more powerful and China was so weak. The big powers aggressed China again and again and each time extorted a great deal. If China still had no power to fight against Japanese by the time of World War II, China would have been a vassal state of Japan. Now, under the successful leading of the Communist party [fm3,2-] China has become a powerful country and no other country dare [vp3,2-] to aggress it without careful consideration of the consequence. And if China were not powerful, Vietnam and India are [vp8,s-] sure to fight China for boundary issues.  	Thus, from the Gulf War and other partial and local wars, we shall see that the world is not so peaceful and it is still of great importance to fight for one's country to protect the lives and properties of the people. We must strengthen our defending forces while developing the economy.  (t8-10)  The only one big sized war in present time [pp1,2-] the Gulf War [sn9,s-] broke out in Jan, 1990. The U.N. army, which was made up mainly of the U.S. soldiers [sn9,s-] fought against IRAQ army both in the air and on the ground. During the war bombers and missles [fm1,-] had found their ways into IRAQ in blocks [wd3,-] Almost everday [fm1,-] there were some bases or buildings destroyed by hundreds of tons of dynamite. In Feb. the same year, only one month late [wd5,2-1] after the begining [fm2,-] of the war, the U.N. force win [vp6,s-] the war unsuspectably [fm2,-]  There was [vp3,s-] no chances for IRAQ to win the war, for it was wrong for it to intrude [vp1,-1] Kuwait, for that [wd5,s-] the weapons of the U.N army were more advanced, moreover [sn9,s-] for that [wd5,s-] many IRAQ [wd2,-1] poeple [fm1,-] did not support Sadam's policy, [sn9,s-] they did not want to fight and even rebelled. Among the three factors, the last one is most important.  Whether the people want to fight for their country is the critical point that influents [fm1,-] the result of the war. During the [wd5,1-3] World War II German [np6,s-] intruded [vp1,-1] France and put it under [wd4,1-1] charge. Frenchmen took up their weapons to fight against the German [np6,2-] Their loves [np5,1-5] for their country had helped them enhanced [sn8,s-] their powers until France defeated Germany in the end. Another example was China during its enemy-occupied time. [wd4,s-] That time Chinese people lived very poor lives, [sn9,s-] many were even under the hungry [wd2,s-] level. But when Japanese rushed into their hometown, they organized themselves up to combat. Within 8 years, they had taught Japanese so many lessons that Japan had to sign the cease fire pact.  Somebody may say the rule is outdated. Yes, the examples of France and of China are old ones. But the Gulf War proved the principle in present time [pp1,2-] We can not doubt it.  As we know, all wars need soliders [fm1,-] No matter how advanced the skill is [sn2,s-] If a person is of bad physical condition or is untrained, it will be difficult for him to do a [wd5,1-3] good fight work [cc4,2-] But an [np7,-2] worse thing is that if he does not want to devote himself to the fighting for his country, how can he put his heart into fighting? Assume now there is a soldier of this kind, and he is asked or forced to join the army. If he is facing some enemy soldiers what result can we induce [wd3,-] ? We will find the only possibility which [pr5,s-] he will run away or surrend [fm1,-] to the enemy.   In the Gulf War, the victory of the U.S. also depended on the soldiers' behavior. Those Amercian [fm1,-] soldiers all fought bravely though [cj1,-s-] how relaxed they were. They all fought for the country, for the U.S.A., for the prestige of their beloved states.  Now I have an intersting [fm1,-] question. Had Sadam's policy not been so cruel, had the IRAQ [wd2,-1] soldiers fought bravely with their hearts [pp1,2-] and had the Americans not wanted to combat in such hot deserts, can we be sure what will [vp8,s-] be the result before the war ended?  Of course, we can not.  
(t8-11)   The Gulf War had been [vp6,s-] over for two and a half years. It will be written into history with its bombards [wd2,2-] thundering and fire burning. Now it is all over, though [ad1,s-] it will appear in text books to illustrate war theories or middle-east [fm3,-1] policies. Except that [sn2,-] what the war left us is just a memory full of violence and a deep thought --- people are still fighting for their country.   The Gulf War began on January 16, 1991. It lasted for 42 days, including 38 days' air battle. The war ended with the multinational army controlling South Kuwait and Iraq. Tens of thousands of Iraqis were killed. Both side [np3,1-] have shown [wd3,-] their great courage during the war. The Kuwaitis, the Iraqis, the Amerians [fm1,-] and others, everyone [wd3,s-] fighted [fm2,-] bravely for their own country.   Human history is a long story of conquering and being conquered. There are always wars, fightings [np5,-] and blood. The purpose [np6,s-] of fightings [np5,-] are various --- power, freedom, land, resources, religion, and even women. It is often very difficult to tell which side stands for justice. But one thing never changes with time [np5,-] or political situation [np6,4-] --- people believe they fight for their country, or their nation. We can find examples very easily, from the war between antient [fm1,-] Greece and Rome, [sn9,s-] to World War II, during which faith to homeland was proved to be [wd4,1-2] great power. It was such power that helped people drive away fascist [np6,s-] which [pr5,s-] had thrived and prospered by destroying everything.   Patriotism comes from love to one's mother. Mothers give birth to their children and bring them up without any complaint. Children's love to their mothers is a combination of gratitude, tenderness and faith. It is a deep feeling from one's heart, so does [wd3,d] love to one's nation. Human [np3,s-] are social animals. Everyone has the intention of belonging to a certain community. They are eager to be accepted by others, so they gathered [vp6,s-] and form tribes, nations, and states. Nobody wants to be lonely. It is miserable for people who have no motherland. They hope to be accepted and protected. They have to pay for the acception [fm2,-] and protection --- that is, [wd3,s-] love, faith, and dedication to the country.   The Gulf War had been [vp6,s-] over, but other wars are going on and new wars will break out in the future. We long for peace, or we fight for peace. There is always contradiction between war and peace. But one thing is clear: no one will be blamed because of fighting for his country.  
(t8-12)   Maybe our world wouldn't exit [wd3,s-] if there hadn't ever been wars. Wars have greatly pushed the society [np4,1-1] advance almost in every respect, especially in science and technology. On the other hand, wars are doubtlessly nightmares which have brought about countless tragedies. Then how should we evaluate wars? And is it still a great thing to fight for one's country?   Usually, it's the conflict between nations that brings out wars. The conflict [np6,s-] includes boundary problems, nation problems and religious problems, some of which have been hung-up [fm2,2-2] for centuries. Wars also happen when a country means to conquer the other one such as the Gulf War. Because war is the quickest way to span a country's territory and obtain large amount of wealth. [sn2,s] A war span varies from a few days to several decades, which depends on the purpose of a war, the military power of both sides and the interference of the third country.   Most People oppose war which they think may destroy the civilised world and cover man's history with humiliation. Of course, war reprents [fm1,-] the dark-side of the world and indicates the limit of man's mind. But can we find another better way to solve so many disputes? Some kinds of disputes can be solved according to laws. For example, Tom stole Sam's wallet [sn9,s-] then Sam can report Tom to the police and the court has [wd4,1-3] right to punish Tom. Tom must submit to the law. Even if he committed [vp1,-s-] [vp6,s-] to protect [wd3,1-2] the verdict, his individual power is too weak to help him escape. But as to the countries, there couldn't be a law which has force on all the member countries, because each independant [fm1,-] country has its own social system and no other country has [wd4,1-3] right to manipulate it. Though we have drawn [wd4,-]several international treaties, still some super nations can break them easily. At a time, we were proud of the United Nations which was expected to keep the world in order. But we are disappointed to see that UN's power is still very limited. The worst thing is that UN was just a political card played by some country in a period. Then, war turns out to be the only approach to end endless disputes. It won't disappear until man's spirit reaches to an extremely holly [wd3,2-1] degree.  Once war breaks [wd4,2-] no one can avoid it. Kuwait would have been diminished by evil Iraq in no time if it had refused to join the war. Just as we Chinese had to fight back [wd4,2-2] Japanese devils in the second [wd4,s-] war. All the wars have the same essence but the [wd5,4-2] different forms. For example, fighting, weapons have been developed greatly since war appeared. From spear [np6,1-1] sword [np6,2-1] gun [np6,3-1] tank [np6,4-3] to biological weapons, atomic bombs and missiles. [sn2,s-] Modern war has put [wd4,s-] emphasis on the sky than on the land. Hence, Hi-tech has become a key point which can decide the final to a great extent.  Most people oppose war because they're afraid of war. We Chinese fear war because we're afraid to lose the present peaceless [wd2,2-] We have suffered so much from war that we'd rather the earth were destroyed than war broke [wd4,2-] But the fact is that no country can refuse war if it does come. You don't mean to fight others but others want to fight you [sn8,s] Mao Zedong has such a famous saying: we don't offense [wd2,s-] others until others offense [wd2,1-1] us. We can't always say war is unjust. Because on the part of the defence country, war is just. We call those national heroes who devoted their lives to the defense war and we erect monuments for them. But we never do so for the dead on the unjust side. A war doesn't always result in tragedies. If the bad side is defeated, then the war has pushed the world a step forward. Fortunately, most of wars ended with the victory of the just side. It conforms with Mao Zedong's conclusion, "Victory always belongs to justice."  War is the exterior form of the interior conflict. Like any other things, war has two sides and no one can avoid it. It won't disappear as long as human beings are living.

(t9-1)  	When our teacher wrote this topic in [wd3,-2] the blackboard, it aroused a heated dispute among our classmates. One boy said with regard to either physical strength or intelligence, [sn9,s-] women are poorer than men, and since the differences are [wd5,3-2] alway [fm1,-] exist, there is not any necessarity [fm1,-] to try to find equality. Some other boys said that it is impossible to have a [wd5,1-6] real and absolute equality [np5,4-2] in reality. So we should take the unequality [fm2,-] for granted and feminine movement is just [wd4,2-3] waste of time and strength. From their point of view, I got a conclusion that feminists are not only necessary but also imperative.  	Thinking of feminists, many people would associate it with those extreme radicals, who advocated that females controlled the world and domineered over males. I don't agree with them, neither [wd3,d] What I believe is that the two genders should treat each other equally, that is, respect each other and understand each other.  	There is no doubt that men and women are different. In fact, every person is different from others. The [wd5,-2] God endows [vp1,-3] us different appearences [fm2,-] personalities and abilities. If used properly every person could contribute to the society greatly. No one or one kind of people is inferior to others. Women are as intelligent and enterprising as men, evidences can be found all around the world. Discriminating [vp1,-] women not only harm [vp3,4-] women but also waste [vp3,s-] human resources. It harms our whole beings. So I think men who believe he [pr3,6-] is superior to women should learn to respect others, especially women.  	The equality, which [wd5,s-] I thought [vp6,s-] is not absolute equality. It is unrealistic to require that the number of female presidents should be exactly [wd4,1-2] same with [wd3,2-5] the number of male presidents. What I think is that women should have more oppertunities [fm1,-] in the society, such as in finding jobs promoting, or getting the same salaries. The oppertunities [fm1,-] also mean that woman [np3,1-5] could have their own choices, that is, if a woman wants to get out and find a job, she should have freedom to do so; If she chooses to stay at home, she would not be accused. So woman liberation does not necessarily mean all woman [np3,1-1] should go out and find a job, but rather means [vp1,-3] give every women [np3,1-] the opportunity to choose by herself.  	After so many years and so many people's struggle, the condition of women has improved greatly. However, in some area like Asia, the situation is not pessimistic. Due to the religions and historical influence, women in China are still struggling for living. Abuseing [fm2,-] women is a common phenomina [fm1,-] [np6,2-] Therefore how can we think feminin [fm1,-] movement is [wd4,1-3] waste of time and useless? And when will women and men, all the human being [np6,3-] can exist harmonily [fm1,-] and equally?  
(t9-2)  	Decades ago, chairman [fm3,-1] Mao, the great leader of Chinese revolution [sn9,s-] claimed: "Chinese women are half of the sky!" Decades later, however, Chinese women haven't yet own [vp9,2-] half of the sky.  	That Chinese women play an essential and indispensible [fm1,-] role in China can't be denied. While the western countries launched overall women liberation campaign [np6,4-] China, [sn9,s-] also put foward [fm1,-] laws to protect women's rights. It's women's legal rights to enjoy equality with men socially, politically and economically. However, it's not totally true in reality.  	According to statistics, only 26% [wd4,-2] government official [np6,3-] are women. Though women do [wd3,s-] phyiscally [fm1,-] weaker [sn8,-2] than men, they are no weaker in intelligence. Unfortunately, men chavvinism [fm1,-] pervades. A lot of people have a prejudice that women are unsuitable for management or politicis [fm1,-] Men chavvinist [fm1,-] [np6,-1] revel in seeing wife [np6,2-2] cooking, washing [wd4,5-4] doing all house chores in the kitchen while husband [np6,s-] sitting comfortably and lesurely [fm1,-] watching TV. And when a woman show [vp3,3-] talent in managing, she is unlikely to be promoted, since the boss (usually they [pr3,s-] are male) are [vp3,s-] skeptical about women's ability. The root of men chavvinism [fm1,-] is China's long feudal thinking influence.  	Though China has been liberated for more than forty years, feudal idea still exists. The Confucius's three cardinal principles are still obeyed by many Chinese [sn9,s-] especially those in rural areas. Confucins [fm1,-1] proposed "husband [np6,-2] guide wife [np6,2-] " and "women's virtue". Women's virtue means " [wd4,s-] wife [np6,s-] is subordinate to [wd4,s-] husband [np6,s-] and at [wd4,1-2] husband's [np6,1-1] disposal." So, when a women [np3,1-] excels, even nowadays, a lot of people still tend to consider her an unprincipled women [np3,2-] Since [wd5,s-] according to women's virtue, a female shouldn't go beyond home, insteadly [fm2,-] their [pr3,s-] duties are doing homework and waitting [fm2,-] on [pp1,-1] husbands. To go to work and show yourself will be considered as immoral. These old ethnical [wd3,d] codes if not possess [wd1,2-s-] [sn9,s-] a dominant part, at least [wd4,s-] a considerable place in many people's minds [sn8,s]  	I can give you an example. This year, a foreign trade company askes [fm2,-] for five graduate [np3,1-] in our institute. Their condition is simple: just five boys. Naturally, the institute doesn't agree. They want to make a bargain: How about three boys and two girls. (By the way, the two girls' academic mark is much better than boys') The company turned down firmly: "Even if you give us four boys and one girl, we wouldn't accept. Just five boys, otherwise, we would go for [wd3,1-1] another college." It sounds somekind [wd2,-] ridiculous. The company's reason is quite straightforward: "Women are weaker both in body and in intelligence. What's more, women will have birth and they'll have vacation. It's uneconomic for us to employ girl students." That's cruel reality, women's ability aren't [vp3,2-] universially [fm1,-] acknowledged.  	It's said Chinese women's social status is [wd4,1-1] highest [aj3,1-1] in the world. Chinese government even put [vp3,s-] high priority in [wd3,1-2] women issues. While the women's liberation organization play [vp3,4-] increasingly important role [np6,2-1] in western countries. [sn2,s-s-] I call on Chinese women become [vp4,s-] more conscions [fm1,-] [aj2,-1] about themselves. Since the reason of the present unequality [fm2,-] not only go [vp3,5-] to men, but also resides in women's part [sn6,s-]  	Some Chinese women is [vp3,3-] greatly influenced by conficusism [fm1,-] They take it for granted that women should stay at home, and it's no good for a women [np3,1-] to go to work and become [wd4,1-1] focus. Once I was asked by a girl: "What's your criteria for boyfriend [np6,1-] ?" I answered directly: "If we love each other." She was surprised: "What if your boyfriend [wd4,3-2] a worker?" "What does that matter?" She told me professionally: "Men should excel women. They can't marry a woman whose background [cc4,-4] and degree [wd4,s-] higher than themselves [sn4,s-]" At that time, I realized how deep [wd2,s-] the "women's virtue" effects [vp1,s-] [vp6,s-]  	Today, Chinese women enjoy more and more rights and their legal rights are respected. However, it's still time for us to say that they've own [vp9,1-] half the sky. They haven't yet own [vp9,1-] half of the sky. Therefore, I propose feminist [np6,2-5] would do good to women.  
(t9-3)  	Nowadays, women's status in many aspects has been elevated. This is attributed a lot [wd5,s-] to the women's liberation. Feminists have done a great deal [wd4,2-3] good rather than harm to the cause of women.  	The most outstanding goal of feminists is struggling for the equality with men in the fields of economic [wd2,4-] political [wd2,5-] and social [wd2,4-] Their efforts have been proven very helpful to improve the women's status, especially in the first and the last field [np6,6-]  	In the economic field. For centuries, the women's economic position was at the bottom of the heap. Women used to stay at home, taking care of the children, cooking, washing and doing all others [wd3,1-2] kinds of houseworking [fm2,-] They didn't go out for work to earn their own living. The family economy depends on men. For that, men thought that women must be very grateful to them. Eventually, men had the sense of superiority, for "it is us to feed you. you can't live on without us." So, "negligible" is the only word occured [fm2,-] to them when women expressed their opinions and wills. One can see how insignificant women's post is both in family and society because of their economic dependence. "Walk out of the kitchen!" is what feminists call for the women. They encourage women go [vp4,s-] out to work, to be independent [aj2,-1] to men in finance so that they can be themselves since they do have to "take men's opinions too seriously."  	In addition, it is not unusual that women's income is lower than men's. Feminists fight against this not only because it is a [np7,-1] economic inequality, but also because it is a social standing's inequality.  	In the social field. Feminists demand that women must have the same chances as men of education, job, social activities, etc. They are in opposition to the sex discrimination in work and insist that women must have the same wage with men of [pp1,2-] same job.  	There are many other goals feminists fight for, such as seeking the political equality, preserving women from family violence and sexual harassement [fm1,-] in work place [np6,2-] against pornaghapha [fm1,-] and using women in advertisment [fm1,-] [sn9,s-] for example, just recently, some university students held the demonstration against "the Miss Hong Kong Contest", appealing for preserving women's dignity, stopping selecting beauty.  	In conclusion, feminists play a very important role in improving women's status, [sn9,s-] they have done a great deal [wd4,2-3] good to women, and will continue to [wd3,1-2] their jobs more efficiently.  
(t9-4)  	If you open Bible, you will read about the myth of Eva's creation from Adam's rib. In ancient China's moral codes, there were three virtue guides, among them was "Husband [np6,-2] guides wife [np6,2-] ". For centuries, Chinese women were confined in their fathers' and later their husbands' houses, taking care of domestic chores, seldom went out, not to mention working equally with men. Women in Islamic countries have to wear long gowns and thick veil outside their houses. Even today their education and profession aren't encouraged. Women in Japan, Korea and Taiwan seldom go out to work even though lots of them have received university education. In human's long history, women were undisputably [fm2,-] placed on a submissive and inferior position. Even in the modern society of the 20th century, unfair treatments of women are still very common.  	Concerning women's education, for example, many schoolaged [fm2,-] daughters of poor peasants are kept in the house, helping with the housework, in order to save money to sent their brothers to school. Some people hold the false idea that girls are slower than boys in academic study and consider it a waste of money to send them to school, esp. higher educational institutes. The misunderstanding and discrimination of women even exist in universities and colleges. Most college admissions officers admit that freshmen women enter with higher marks and better high school records than freshmen men, as if because [wd5,s-] only the best-prepared girls are encouraged to try for college. When fewer women make the grade in academic life, their smaller numbers are taken to mean that they don't want to or are not capable of finishing complicated academic study.  	Women have a harder time than men when they are into the job market. Our institute as well as thousands of other universities and colleges in China face [vp3,12-] a big problem of assigning female graduates to working units. Companies think women are troublesome for their long period of conception and child rearing. Because of family pressure, women are usually not as active and ambitious as their men counter-parts in work. As a result, there is a prevailing view in the society that women are home-oriented while men are career-oriented. More chances of promotion are given to men instead of their female colleages [fm1,-] who may have the same or even better ability of fitting the post. Christine Craft, a Kansas TV anchor earned $38,500 a year, half of her male co-anchor's $75,000 salary [cc4,1-] Even so, her boss once said to her, "you are too old, too unattractive, and not sufficiently deferential to men". As to "not sufficiently deferential to men", the boss continued to explain, "You don't play second fiddle to your male co-anchors, you don't hide your intelligence to make the guys look smarter." In this case, the female anchor was unfairly paid. Worse than that, she wasn't able to keep her job for she's too outstanding, too intelligent and she even took the leading role from men.  	Generally speaking, the society has a wrong expect [wd2,2-2] of women, [sn9,s-] it see [vp3,1-] women as the genre dependent on men to make decisions both at home and at job, staying at home taking care of the family, sacrificing their creativity in return [pp2,s-] of marital harmony. It also sets a fix [wd2,2-1] standard of how a woman should be: it is not necessary for her to receive as much education as man, she doesn't have to work as hard either. As a result, many women are kept at home, and many career women are treated unfairly.  	Women's liberation movement is the result of these injusice [fm1,-] and misunderstanding. The movement includes persuading, protesting and education, hoping to wake up human race from its false tradition, help them, esp. women, to understand the essence of the status quo. Its goal is to achieve women's public and political identities seperate [fm1,-] from that of their husbands, as well as their freedom to lead the kind of life of their own choice.  	Enthusiasts of women's lib write articles, make statements to enlighten the masses, pointing out the unfairness. In treating of women's role in the family, they hold that it is not correct to assume that women are better at detailed work simply because that is the work they customarily do. While talking about women at jobs, they agree that differences exist between the two sexes, but these shouldn't be the reason to exclude women from well- paying jobs or keep them in inferior positions. They are strongly for the equal status among all human beings, women and men. The two sexes should have equal chances in education, job and home decision, and they should coorperate [fm1,-] in all these aspects.  	Mainly, their points of views are correct and means, suitable. Though there are some radical actions, they can't represent the whole.  	So, forward [wd3,-] women's lib! During more than of [wd5,2-3] a century of your struggle history [cc1,1-][sn8,s] great changes have taken place. Laws of women protection are promogated [fm1,-] in countries all over the world. Men are better estimating their old and new relations with women. While the most important of all [sn7,-] woman [np3,s-s-] have gradually stand [vp9,3-] up and are ready to defend their legal rights. They go out of their home where they have been tied to for thousands of years. They receive better education, have jobs and have more chances to see the world. In a word, they are trying to act as an equal social force as men.  	However, any change can be bitter and hard to procede [fm1,-] So never stop, women's lib. Forward [wd3,-] to stop the unfairness! Forward [wd3,-] to free the men from the burden of supporting psychic [np6,2-] [wd7,s-] as well as financial dependents! Forward [wd3,-] to give women true happiness to embrace their own fate [wd7,s-] ! Forward [wd3,-] to achieve eternal human harmony between the two sexes! 	 	Forward [wd3,-] women's lib!  
(t9-5)  	No longer was it possible to operate on the assumption that most women would spend the majority of their lives tending the home or taking care of children. That experience are [vp3,2-] now the exception rather than the rule. By the end of the 1960s the women's movement had succeeded in challening [fm1,-] nearly all traditional cultural assumptions about women's proper place. They challenge employment discrimination, bias against women in politics, and the antifemale [fm1,-] prejudice so dominant in the country's major economic and social institutions. They also fight for [wd4,1-2] repeal for [wd5,2-3] of abortion laws, provide support for alternative life-styles, and, above all, raise the consciousness of women to the cultural bondage of being categorized as a sex object. The social struggles of the feminist movement had clearly produced far-reaching and impressive gains. Therefore, in my opinion, feminists have done more good to the cause of women than harm. We can analyse the reasons from five aspects.  	In the first place, political discourse and behaviour also reflected the impact of changing gender roles. In America, though the administration of Ronald Reagan consistently adopted positions [wd4,2-3] anathema of [cc1,1-1] feminists, the same administration appointed the first woman justice of the United States Supreme Court, named two women to the cabinet, and claimed to be more committed to women's rights than any previous administration. In [wd3,-3] the influence of the movement, the quantity of women in employment has been increasing. The distribution of women in jobs historically defined as exclusively male also showed substantial change.  	In the second place, massive changes had occured [fm2,-] in family life. Because of the faminists' [fm1,-] effort, the family violence is decreased sharply by public opinion. Partly as an indication of all these social shifts, the family also changed dramatically. The shifts in family composition also testified, at least in part, to "new rules" governing attitudes toward sex, self-fulfillment, and gender roles. Also because of the faminists' [fm1,-] effort, informed by changing attitudes [wd7,s-] toward individual fulfillment, hundreds of thousands of young women have charted a new course for themselves, [wd4,s-] free of many of the constraints that in the past had assigned women to prescribed roles.  	In the third place, the professional women appeal to stop the sexual harassement [fm1,-] in work place. The standpoint indicates that the woman is not a plaything. According to this, many governments begin to pay attention to the woman's position in work and try their best to decrease the sexual harassment. Even in the army, American government will punish the man who does the sexual harassment to a woman. On the other hand, the prostituting [vp1,1-1] is publicized [vp1,3-3] an illegal thing to prevent the porn trade from developing in many countries.  	In the forth [fm1,-] place, the women fight for [wd4,1-2] repeal of abortion laws and the freedom of lesbian (of course, it is not suitable in China). They think it can improve human rights for everyone.  	In the fifth place, Many [fm3,s-] women are against [pp1,s-] they are used as a model in advertisment [fm1,-] In fact, it is useful for the employers to improve their goods' quality. Many employers only like to use the beautiful women to attract the customers. Sometimes it is effective, but if your quality is not good, you still will lose the customers. If the employers decrease [vp1,-4] to use the models and improve the quality to attract the customers, it is a good thing for society.  	Clearly, enormous changes have occured [fm2,-] both in the daily experience and in the cultural norms describing masculinity and femininity in society. The changes appear almost revolutionary in dimension [np6,6-] But it was [vp6,d] too early to conclude that dramatic progress toward equality had taken [vp6,s-] [cc2,s-] place. Therefore, at last I appeal to everyone in society to participate [wd4,-] the feminist movement which heigtens [fm1,-] the women's positions.  
(t9-6)  	One prominent and controvercial [fm1,-] campaign of this century is the feminist campaign. The Feminists, with their awakening consciousness of the women's value and human dignity, call for the equality of women with men in terms of economy, politic [wd2,1-2] social role [np6,3-3] and other aspects.  	The most emphasized and first demanded equality is about the job. It comes into [wd4,3-2] feminists [np4,-1] mind that women have always been in a discriminated position in [wd4,1-3] access to job [np6,2-] Firstly it's difficult for them to get a job. Many companies would rather employ a man even [wd4,s-] his ability is much lower than the female applicant. Secondly, if the women are finally employed, their salary [np3,1-1] are pretty lower than her [pr3,s-] male colleagues though they do the same kind of work. Therefore, what the feminists want is the equality that both women and men should stand on the fair ground of competition and that no discrimination should be exercised.  	Another proposition [np1,1-3] to protect women from [wd3,s-] the feminists is to curb the ill-treatment towards women. One is worsening sexual harassment in work places by their bosses. In the world where male [np3,-1] dominate almost all the enterprises, women, as their subsidiaries [sn9,s-] are in a very disadvantage [wd2,2-1] state. It's rather frequent that female [np3,s-] suffer from the harassment from their bosses phisically [fm1,-] and spiritually. Those who refuse will probably be fired or have no chance of promotion. The other is the family violence. Plenty of women stay at home, caring for the house and the children while [cj1,s-] financially rely [vp5,s-] on their husbands. So, when they are battered by husbands, they are in very negative position for they have no financial support in [wd3,3-2] their back, so they may possibly submitted [vp9,2-] [sn9,s-] this, would reverse to worsen their situations. [sn8,s-] 	The call for political equalty [fm1,-] is may be [fm2,1-] the most fundamental and significant one. Because the equality on other aspects such as economy and social role are embodied and consolidated by political right. [sn2,s] Women won their right for vote in the near [wd7,2-1] 1970s. Today, they are taking [wd4,2-3] more active part in more fields of the social life. Some have taken up posts in government, and some even became the governmen [fm1,-] chief [np3,s-] like Mrs. Thather. Apart from the above, feminists also appeal for other rights like abortion and lesbian.  	In my opinion, a large portion of the feminists [np4,1-1] propositions are [vp3,s-] sound and useful. They serve as pioneer [np3,3-] and ice-breaker [np3,5-] which [pr5,s-] run on the first front in the battle against the unfair social convention. And, as a consequence, [wd4,s-] will surely bring about the bright future for the women, even, [sn9,s-] the whole human society.  	However, the feminists are [wd5,2-3] also tend to be too radical in some aspects. For examples [pp2,1-] some feminists tend to be hateful and inappropriately associate anything with the illtreatment [fm1,-] of women. Like [wd5,s-] some suggest that all the words with "man", like "human, mankind," should have relevant "huwoman [fm1,-] womankind" in a way of equality. These, [sn9,s] are too extreme, because language is the result of remote history and are only signals. Some suggest that women should be as hard and rough as men and that there should be no womanly gentle [wd2,s-] which is another kind of extreme [np6,1-]  	To sum up, feminists have contributed a great deal to the good of women. Tribute should go to them except that they should be more objective and moderate on some terms [wd7,s-]  
(t9-7)  	According to some reports of newspaper, nowadays, more and more Battered Women Shelters are established in the world, with the purpose to give some help to the women who have suffered bad treatmeat [fm1,-] of their husbands. Obviously women and men have still not been equal, women are still not liberated. No wonder a crusade for women's right becomes more and more thriving.  	Though the slogan --- men and women are equal --- has been shouted for years, unequality [fm2,-] between men and women still exists on [wd3,s-] many aspects.  	For example, the graduate distribution [wd7,s-] which has to be faced by most of the university students, has become a headache to girls. Since many companies just prefer to accept males as their staffs [np6,s-] girls stand little chance for jobs. Graduate distribution [wd7,s-] falls into the one in which only sex is important but not students' capacity or achievement. This also provides a reason why boys' marks in their study are alway [fm1,-] lower than girls in most universities. For no matter how low the boys have got the marks [sn8,s-] they are the first choices to many companies. What an unfair world!  	Battered Women Shelter, which is mentioned at the very beginning, reveals another serious problem in our society. Traditional custom which requires women to give up their careers and go back home taking care of the family while their husbands devote themselves into their careers, confines many women to their housework. According to a book named "See U.S. from the University", we get to know that many female M.A. [wd4,3-] even PH.D, [wd4,5-] in U.S. universities, have to leave their careers when they are married for they have to provide a good environment for [wd4,1-2] husbands' study. Couples like Mr. and Mrs. Curie are not easy to be seen. What a waste of such females' good brains!  	From these, we can see that movement for women's rights is necessary for improving the females' social standards. In order to change the unequal situation I suggest that feminist [np6,1-1] can do something like the followings [np6,1-] :  	Firstly, we can rely on the publicization [fm2,-] Since nowadays there are still quite a lot of people [sn8,s-] do not realize the disadvantage [wd2,1-1] condition that women are standing in, publicization [fm2,-] seems very important. Feminists can give lectures to the public and let [vp1,-3] people aware of the existing unequality [fm2,-] [sn9,s-] in addition, feminists can set up some schools for women, just to teach them how to protect themselves by the way of law, for a lot of women just accept their fates when they suffer bad treatment.  	Secondly, feminists can urge the goverments [fm1,-] to set up some practical laws for women's rights. Most companies, for instant [wd3,1-] do not want to accept females as their staffs [np6,s-] One reason I suggested is that they have to pay the salary to women who are going to bear children and could not work. Thus, I think that the company of the husband and that of the wife can share [vp1,-4] to pay the salary. Governments should set up some laws about that. If such laws really put [vp7,s-] into use, women's rights can make [np7,-2] great stride. [cc2,s-] 	We are anxious to see any practical improvements for women's rights are [wd4,s-] [sn8,s-] coming soon.  
(t9-8)  	Human [wd3,s-] is divided into two parts: Man and woman, [wd4,s-] each plays an important role in this world. But are they equal? Absolutely not. Thus there comes [vp3,s-] women's liberation compaign [fm1,-] and Feminists, who struggle for the equality with men in the Man-chauvinism [cc1,-] world. Yet someone said: "Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good." Is that true?  	To answer this question, we'd better have a look at the situations now. From newspapers, we heard from time to time about the cruel husbands and battered wives and all kinds of unfairness towards women. Even in China where others believe women are equal to men, things is [vp3,1-] actually not so ideal. Though the government has stressed many times that men and women are equals, and we often say "women are half of the world". There are always people who just neglect all these. For example, when a [np7,-1] enterprise goes headhiking [fm2,-] it would not hire you no matter how competent you are because you are a woman. It would rather hire a men [np3,1-] less competent. Such kind of phenominon [fm1,-] are [vp3,4-] not uncommon in China. This is the reality facing Chinese women and women in other countries as well. So we need a compaign [fm1,-] a reform urgently. Answering this need, Feminists appeared.  	So what have they done? Women's Liberation Movement emerged in 1960s. It is not a long history. Yet the Feminists have done a lot: they persued [fm1,-] equality with men in economy, in society and in politics; they protested against sexual harassement [fm1,-] in work place; they helped women who were victims of family violence; they opposed porn industries. Above all, they have waken up the consciousness of women in the world about the serious matter, and lead the struggle for a better world. Now we can say "no" to the previous question.  	Perhaps, there exist some unproper [fm2,-] or overdone actions. For instance, some Feminists suggested [vp1,-3] to change "history" into "herstory". I don't think this would do any good and situation wouldn't change because of this simple change of words. We need more practical action rather than such formality. But comparing [vp5,-s-] to the good they have done, these overdones [fm2,-] are minor, and can be neglected.  	In conclusion, Feminists have done more good than harm. Only man-chauvinist [np3,s-] considering their shaking position, will say bad words against Women's Liberation Movement.  
(t9-9)  	Feminism is no longer a new concept to people nowadays. The feminist [np3,s-] commenced their actions since the beginning of this century, [sn9,s-] in less than 100 years, the movement has influenced a fairly large part of the world.  	Advocators and fighters of feminism make every effort to realise women's equality with men, which is women's great ideal for centuries. They strive for their aim in almost every field of modern society: equality in economics, in politics and in social aspect; self-determination on matters varied [vp5,s-] from sexual [wd2,1-] to abortion and advertisment [fm1,-]  	Feminism does obtain sweet [cc4,-1] success in the fields as was [vp3,s-] stated above. In most western counties, series of laws and regulations have been made and put forth to protect women's legal rights. Special allowances also have been legally set for them; women's social estate has been greatly improved and their status in education, employment as well as in politics and economics have [vp3,s-] been greatly bettered.  	Anyway, feminists in Britain and America, perhaps because of their too [cc4,-2] serious eagerness for their ideal, seemingly have gone to extremes in these years. One of their famous demands is the legal and social acknowledgement for lesbian, [sn9,s-] even if this demand could be regarded as understoodable [fm2,-] how can people accept their calls of equality in Porn? It's so ridiculous and absurd, no wonder that there are someone [np3,1-2] who say that feminists have done more harm, [sn9,s-] to the cause of women than good. People can't help thinking whether if [wd5,s-] the feminism will change this which is called "man chauvinist" society [sn8,s-] to a "women [np3,1-] chauvinist" one?  	But if we turn to the rest of the world, the situation is quite different. In those areas, the voice of feminism is weak [wd4,s-] even soundless: [sn9,s-] 	Koran, the Bible of lslum [fm1,-] rules the society of [wd4,1-2] lslum [fm1,-] world. In countries such as lran, lraq, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, commandments and precepts on Koran direct people's thought and made [vp6,s-] the society a complete man-absolution [fm2,-] one. Those strict rules not only forbid women to involve in politics and economics, but also inhibit them from taking part in the usual social activities: Women are always on [wd3,-1] unemployment, women are not allowed to walk on street or show up in any public place without their black veils, women are not permitted to talk to strangers.... I wonder how's the feeling of the women [wd1,s-] there. Have they ever thought or heard of feminism? Have the conception of equality with men ever came [vp9,8-] into their mind? Personally I hope there is a day they'll become aware of this and try their best to change it.  	Generally, East Asia is another region which the feminist should pay attention to (China is an exception, in this anciently historied [fm2,-] country, everything is under the doctrine of mean. We haven't yet find [vp9,3-] any need for feminism presently).  	In Japan and South Korea both of which have been deeply affected by Confucianism in social psychology, women's social estate is "traditionally" rather lower. Man-superiority has got deep roots in the society, [sn9,s-] man is the master both in and out of the home, man is responsible for all social intercourses [np5,-] man is the only back-bone of the family, man makes lives [wd3,1-5] for his wife and children.... while the woman is destined to play the role of wife to husband, mother to children and servant in the house; few chances are provided for women to develop their own career. A rather popular saying may tell us something elusive: "Japanese women are the most submissive wives on the world". Although feminism has been exerting its influence in the two countries, the achievement is little.  
(t9-10)  	Do feminists and women benefit from feminism greatly? Do they suffer from it? What target do those feminist [np3,1-] want to reach? And what is the specific definition of feminism?  	Perhaps, the first feminist's motive is pure [wd2,1-2] for promoting [vp1,-3] women to struggle for their social statue [wd3,s-] But, there is one important point which the first feminist neglected, that is, she and her followers did not give a definition for feminism, at least did not give a strict definition. That is why the feminism caused so many serious problems later. This is the root.  	As we all know, everything should have their own place for moving. It is necessary to limit their own activities in the place and it is seldom allowed to go beyond. For instance, army men should do things according to military rules; human beings should obey the law of nature, otherwise, they are punished. The feminists now just met the unforturnate [fm1,-] condition.  	Men and women are completely different. It is impossible to win the equality between them in all fields. I don't mean women should always follow men in every field. I mean women can do as good [ad2,2-] as men, or better than men in some fields, but not [wd4,s-2] all fields. In fact, feminists want to surpass men in every fields [np3,1-] they even want to place themselves over men. This surely caused [vp6,s-] many serious problems, which are difficult to solve, even for those feminists.  	As to the equality with men, the society has offered equal opportunity for both men and women. In this condition, women and feminists should take effort in improving their own ability in order to contest with man. In most cases, feminists don't do like that. They just call on those women to quarrel with men for equality. It is very difficult to get same salary, same number of officials in govermental [fm1,-] institutions, because the women don't have enough ability, although they have enough energy.  	Feminism is also one of the reasons caused [vp5,s-] family violent [wd2,2-] We know, most feminists are female. To those married female feminists, the most direct struggling action is to ask for equal rights in family. In most cases, men give what they want to show their generosity, while in some family [np3,2-] [sn9,s-] the number of this kind of family [np6,3-] is not small, husbands can't stand the feminists' excessive demand. Of course, it's not only the feminists' thing [wd7,2-] men also should be responsible for it. Here, I just point out, feminism is one of the reasons caused [bp5,s-] family violent [wd2,2-]  	Furthermore, [wd4,s-] sexual problem has been becoming more and more serious since the feminism appeared, such as, [sn9,s-] sexual harrasment [fm1,-] in work, porn, abortion, Ads [fm1,4-2] for women and its bad affection, homosexuality, etc. I don't know why all these things developed so quickly since then. Because I'm writing about feminism, so [wd5,s-] I have to think that's [sn8,s-] some feminists go beyond their legal sope [fm1,-] and partly caused [vp6,s-] these problems. Why don't those Islam countries have these problems? It is because the women in these countries just do women's own things. They are in their legal scope.  	All in all, feminists should take effort in improving women's own ability so that they can enlarge their legal scope gradually. Feminism now really do [vp3,3-] harm to women, except  feminists give a strict definition to the term of feminism from now.[sn8,-]  
(t9-11)  	"Should men and women be equal?" This is a question much discussed by people all over the world today.  	Many say that men and women should not be regarded as equal, because many things men do could not be done by women. They say that men have always shouldered the responsibility of protecting women, therefore men are stronger than women and should have more right than women.  	From a certain point of view, these remarks may sound reasonable. But take [vp4,s-] everything into consideration, one must consider men and women equal. Nowadays, many things done by men are done also by women, which is, to some extend [pp2,2-] attributed to the feminists' struggle for the equality of women. Women are playing an increasingly important role in society today. Having repeatedly demonstrated ability in roles traditionally held by men, they are showing just how much they can contribute. No longer can it be said that women's place is only in the home raising children and keeping house. Women have now walked out of the kitch [fm1,-] Throughout [wd4,1-1] society, capable women are proving that they are valuable to the communities.  	But some say that it's the women's liberation that makes women's situation worse. They argue that it is too much for women to work full-time outside the home and take care of home as well. As a matter of fact, this argument is groundless at all.  	With the changes in their social role, women's position in the family has been improved as well. The wife no longer is obedient to her husband but, instead, exerts an influence on the children and family affairs equal to that of the husband. Morer [fm1,-] the husband must now assume some of the responsibilities of maintaining a household such as cooking, cleaning and other such job around the house. Although China was once a deeply rooted feudal countrony [fm1,-] great changes of women's social position have taken place. A numerber [fm1,-] of social trends are combining to produce a unique shift in family relationship. The idea of a man doing all the housework was little thought of as laughable. There is a revolution in sex-roles. In some big cities, an increasing number of two-parent families have a woman as the source of income as well as the husband, although some poor rural areas [cc2,-s-] are still prevailling [fm2,-] the traditional pattern of men working outside while women staying at home.[sn8,-] It is less embarrassed [aj4,3-3] about the situation that the father shoulders part of the houshold [fm1,-] chores.  	In this case, we say, working outside while taking care of the family, the wife benefits a lot. Firstly, the wife is independent economically. She'll be subject to nobody. Secondly, when working, she'll meet with people from all walks of life and tackle various problems, even some hard ones, [sn9,s-] also she can learn a lot from her job, which will strengthen her will and wider [wd2,s-] her field of vision. Thirdly, if she just stays at home to do house work and take care of her children, she'll gradually feel life is so dull that she'll be tired of it. Occasionally, she'll be in a bad mood, which is not good for the family.  	In conclusion, women's liberation raises women's social position and cause [vp3,s-] a variety of changes in interpersonal relationship within a family, which is good to women, but [sn6,s-] not [sn8,s-1] does harm to women.  
(t9-12)  	A famous Chinese saying "Women can hold up half of the sky" can mostly portray the situation of Chinese women in present days.  	It is true that Chinese women can enjoy more priviledge [fm1,-] than women in the western society, but things are not always the case. Before 1949, women were at the bottom of the society. Discrimination can be reflected from many aspects. In characters, most Chinese character [np3,2-] with 'nu' (meaning women) as their components [np6,s-] mean evil qualities of mankind, such as 'greed' and 'wicked'. Even Confusuis [fm1,-] the blilliant [fm1,-] thinker and educator held that "women and villains are untrustworthy". In a man-chauvinist country like old China, women could not keep their own names at the moment they were married. Shortly after liberation, over 90% of the female grown-up [np3,5-] were illeterate [fm1,-] [np3,s-] or semi-illelerates [fm1,-] owing to the fact that only men can learn [vp1,-3] read and write in the old time because in the traditional concept only men can carry on the family name, they deserved all the privillege [fm1,-] in the society.  	During the four decades after liberation, China has seen conspicuous improvement in women's social status. First of all, from central government to township faculty, "Women's Federation [np3,1-1] " are set up to deal with women problems specifically, such as family violence, women abuse, child abuse etc. It is owing to this organization that China sees fewer problems with sex-discrimination than most Westen [fm1,-] countries. It is also for this organization of this organization [wd7,s-] that the privilege and equality are trickling down to Chinese women. The constitution stipulated that women should gain equal job opportunity as men. Most urban families, consequently, have the wives as one of their bread-earners. The history has ceased of Chinese women wearing their husband's family names before their own.  	Chinese husbands can be attributed to this great success for their lenience and kindness. There is also a slang to call the hen-pecked husband "Qi Guan Yan" (literally [wd4,s-] means tracheitis [fm1,-] while pronoucingly [fm2,-] similar to "wife controls tight"). Most Chinese husbands don't feel ashamed of the nickname. Why should they? If being called "Qi Guan Yan" means more respects are being paid to the wives in families why should the husbands [np3,s-] concern so much about his face, since a society, [sn9,s-] any society can not be regarded as a highly civilized one unless enough attention and respects are being paid to women.  	Chinese success does not mean it [pr1,s-] has achieved enough to rest. Actually, the more it achieves, the more it finds the problems [wd1,4-] Take the women in the better-off coastal cities in the south as an instance. My women [wd7,-s-] taking the westen [fm1,-] patten [fm1,-] as a model, quit their jobs and reduce to housewives after their husbands have become millionairs [fm1,-] Some even regard it as a fashion to wear [cc3,-2] husband's surname contrasting [vp1,s-] the westen [fm1,-] feminists are struggling for the women's right [vp4,s-] be called by their own names. What is undeniable, however, is that China is the country that makes the greatest accomplishment in women affairs and the whole world recognizes it with the honor of the 1st World Women's Conference being held in this country in 1995.  
(t9-13)  	What should a woman look like? Hearing this question, most people may come to this [wd3,s-] answer that a woman should be as busy as a bee in the kitchen, sweep the floor while telling the children's story and knit while humming the cradlesong. But this has been severely criticised by feminists who strongly advocate that women shouldn't be confined to housework and they have the right to work as men do. These feminists are the champion [np3,4-] for the liberation of women from the yoke of chores. To some extent, they do help women gain some equality, especially in China where women have been fettered by the feudal tradition of the three cardinal guides and the five constant virtues for so many years. But in my opinion, generally they have done more harm to the cause of women than good.  	Although most women are still clinging to traditionally feminine jobs such as nursing, teaching and office work, some pioneers have ventured into new fields which used to be men's patent. They run business, become astronauts, lawyers and take up politics. The tide of working women seems to sweep the world. But just as the common saying goes: "To be a woman is difficult but [wd3,s-] to be an independent woman is more difficult." Women's new role in the society has created some striking effects on both the society and the family. In the first place, since a woman work [vp3,2-] and is able to support herself, she becomes free to choose her marriage. As a result, today's women tend to marry later. Their devotion to their career results in the decline of birthrate. Perhaps this is welcome in some developing countries with overpopulation, but it poses a threat to some western-European countries whose population is too small to coincide with its rapid pace of economic development. In the second place, women's new role touches their family life. The most direct victims are their children. They spend most of their time not with their parents but with baby-sitters and teachers in the kindergartens. Due to the lack of motherly love, they tend to have an uncommunicative and eccentric disposition. For the working mothers have to devote themselves to their work, they can spare little time to take care of their children. Consequently, their children drift apart from them. Some working mothers make a success in their career, which does give them pride and self-confidence, but also makes them "guilty" towards their children. Owing to the long-time lack of communication, the children no longer tell their secrets first to their mothers, nor act like a spoiled child in front of their mothers. All of these deeply hurt the working mothers. They always try to make some compensation. Some of them have to take up a double career --- both as a working woman and as a housewife. Every day, they're kept constantly on the run between their home and office. Endless social activities and the drudgery of housework almost become the main content of their life. They are tired of the inflexible life but they have to put up with it because they want to be both a qualified career woman and a qualified mother. However, they're deficient in energy. They feel a heavy burden, which makes them at the edge of collapse. They're exhausted both mentally and physically. So, working women do have gained self-confidence and independence, but haven't gained real happiness.  	Thirdly, women's new role has a bad influence on the relationship between wife and husband. It must be admitted that more and more husbands are willing to share housework with their wives. But we must realise the deep- rooted tradition that the housework is mainly under the charge of women. So, most men only accept the theory of sharing chores with their wives, but they don't put it into practice. They have got used to being greeted by their wives when they come home and being served the delicious meal when they sit at the table. When their wives take a career, all have changed. Unavoidably, they will blame each other for not supporting and understanding the other party [wd3,s-] The worse is the marriage can be destroyed when the wife is more successful in her career than her husband in his, particularly when she earns more than he does. The two points become the main reasons for the increase of divorce rate. Usually it is the wife who hurts most because women are more fragile in sentiment (we cannot deny women's nature).  	The last point I'd like to mention is that feminists' view of women's complete equality to men is unpractical. The physical differences between women and men determine that women can't be qualified with any career that attracts them. If a weak woman insists on doing the job of carrying luggage at station just as the man does, it will only ruin her. It's pointless to compete with men in this aspect. It's a fact that women often meet great difficulties on their way to the success of their careers which are beyond their traditional ones. The factor of themselves and the factor of the society have both prevented them from reaching the top.  	Nowadays, working women see themselves in a new light. They've realised their own value. But for women, taking a career involves sacrifice --- either their family harmony or their physical health. However, most of the working women are bearing a heavy burden --- the double career (home and office). Feminists have helped women shake off the traditional yoke of housework, but who will help them to lay down to [wd3,s-] heavy burden of double career [np6,2-] ?  
(t9-14)  	Men and women compose a wonderful world and the relationship between them remains changing throughout the history. In the ancient matriarchal society, women dominated the society. Then when the society entered into [wd5.-]the patriarchal society, men took a leading role and this continues till now. Yet ever since 70's, the movement of women liberation has been brought before people, particularly in the Western country [np6,4-]  	Feminists insist that women should be equal to men and women should go out to work in the society instead of staying at home taking care of the kids. It's a great challenge to the traditional concept and it made women re-consider how to carry out their self-value in the society. As a result, many women return to the colourful society and become career women. People view [vp1,-4] on this phenomenon differently. Some say that it has done more harm than good to the cause of women. Yet I'm afraid I can't agree with that. Women should go out to the society as men do.  	First, what on earth is the cause of women? Of course, family is a great cause to women, yet it's far from enough. Besides taking good care of her husband and kids, a woman should also try her hand in society --- take a job. Everyone is born equal, so women and men should have the same right, the same freedom to choose one's own cause. Admittedly, there does exist difference between men and women, yet it doesn't matter. Since there are divisions of labour, people should cooperate with each other. As long as people take the job which suits them, it's O.K. And only when women go out to the society can they have enough chance to realize their value, to exert their ability fully. Just staying at home looking after the kids, doing the house chores and serving the husband is not all that women can do, their wisdom and ability enable them to do much and more greater [aj3,1-] thing [np6,5-] than these, of course those house work [np3,2-] are great too.  	Maybe some people worry that if women take jobs[cc3,1-], then it will do harm to the family and it may be too much for women to take a job as well as keep the house. If you come to China and have a look, you will find that this worry is groundless. Most women in China have a job as her husband does and they also have a happy family, lovely kids. It's partly due to Chinese women's hardworking [wd2,2-] yet more important is that how people view [vp1,-2] on it. If all the people are for [pp1,s-] a woman to have her own career and give her chance, such as [sn8,s] the government set [vp3,2-] up kindergarten [np6,2-1] where the mother can sent [vp9,1-] their kids to [wd5,s-] and then go to work at ease, and also the husband should have a hand in the house chores, then a woman can own a happy family and her own career at the same time.  	To go out to the society is not only good for women themselves, it can strengthen the linking between husband and wife as well. If a woman just stay [vp3,4-] at home and do [vp3,s-] all the housechores [fm2,-] I'm sure she will get bored of it sooner or later. Even worse, she will be out of keeping with society because of her lack of contact with it. She will have no idea of what's going on except the price in the market. While on the other hand, the husband goes home after a tiring day, and he maybe [fm2,1-2] too tired to talk to his wife too much about the work, to care about the housework and kids, and if he has any trouble in work he won't talk with her complaining wife for she can't understand him at all. Then gradually, the husband and wife haven't much common language, and the link between them will break. Yet if both the husband and wife have their career, and do the housework together, they will find it easier to communicate with each other and feel [vp1,-s-] more like that they are in the same boat. They can share their happiness and sorrowness [fm2,-] both in work and about family together.  	In reality, it's also impossible for all the women to stay at home. Due to the division of labour, men and women should cooperate with each other for both of them have their own speciality [fm1,-] General [wd2,-4] speaking, men are taking a leading role in the world, yet there are some fields that men can't take the place of women. So what about encouraging the women to go out to the society and make the world more colourful?  
(t9-15)  	Feminists are said to have done more harm to the cause of women than good. In my opinion, it goes the other way round. Since the women liberation, women have raised their social status. Women have obtained more freedom. Women are more confident than ever. In short, feminists speak out for women, hence, women can have as equal chances as men.  	In the long history of human society evolution, women have been cosidered [fm1,-] to be inferior to men, except for in [wd5,2-3] the matrilineal commune. The duty of women was to wait on men, attend to family chores and care for children. Women had no position of their own whether inside or outside families, while men are [vp6,s-] justified to dominate the whole society. It is, of course, totally unfair. Women possess their unique merits. They are fit for a large number of jobs. They need not be the accesory [fm1,-] of men. They certainly can support themselves and even compete with men openly and fairly. They must break away [wd4,2-3] the traditional norms that women are not match for men. Feminists stand out and call on their sisters to strive for their own rights. They stir their sisters' sleeping consciousness in order to help them out of men's domination. The facts prove that women have contributed a great deal to the whole society since they are equal to men as a member [np3,s-] of the society.  	Women are not born to be confined to a family. They can act not only the part of [wd4,2-1] daughter, wife and mother, but also the part of [wd4,3-1] secretary, teacher, minister, president and so on. They have the ability to do a good job as long as the whole society will do away with the concept that women are stupider [aj3,-] or weaker than men. When women walk out of the small limited circle, they will see a very broad world around her [pr3,s-] In this world, they will explore and develop their potential capability. They infuse the active power into the original men-dominating world and thus promote the development of the society in all aspects. As women enter the outside world, the competition becomes more and more fierce. It undermines men's superiority and wons [fm2,-] their respect towards women. However, women should not be misled in the process of self-support. There exists sexual discrimination in the division of jobs. Women are considered to be able to do only a few kind [np3,2-] of traditional jobs. Most of these jobs are regarded as unimportant by men. Therefore, that women go out to work does not necessarily mean women have equal opportunities. Women should have the ability to challenge other jobs, especially [wd4,s-] which are [wd5,s-] used to be men's, such as politician and scientists. Meanwhile, women should not be blind to see their own limitedness. They must act in accordance with their existing and potential abilities. Although women can do more jobs than housework, they are not supposed to do all kinds of jobs.  	If women can't walk out their small circle and speak and act for themselves, they are more likely to be a loser [np3,7-] When children grow up, they leave their mother. Husbands may not value their wives very much and tend to have affairs with other women. As years go by, women sacrifice their youth and beauty. They take pride in, if any, only their husbands or children. However, their husbands or children will do better jobs than they will if they support them. In such circumstance [np6,2-] women may take scrificication [fm1,-] into account.  	All in all, whenever possible, women ought not to hide in the shadows of men. They have all reasons to struggle against the oppression and discrimination of men. As long as there are men and women in [wd3,5-2] the earth, they are equal. Women don't have to submit to men. Women are free to choose to do what they like or what they are fit for. As Chinese say, women can hold up half the sky.  
(t9-16)  	A well-balanced nature, which used to be an Eden for humanity has no longer existed because humanity has regarded himself as the masters [np3,s-] of nature and has been excessively exploiting and utilizing natural resources without considering the consequnces [fm1,-] that will follow, let alone paying any attention to nature's calling. In order to develop industries and build housing estate, mankind constantly cuts down trees at will, exploits prairie [np6,1-] and primative [fm1,-] forest without reconstruction [wd2,1-1] them, or even removes a whole hill for some aim. For the purpose of chasing profits, they hunt and kill immense [cc4,-2] wild animals. Worsely [fm2,-] people even destroy nature carelessly: deposit litter freely, release the waste even harmful residue and water into the rivers and discharge black poisonous smoke into the air.  	Then, what are the consequences after continuous devastating destruction of nature? Human beings sow the wind and reap the whirlwind. In some urban cities and developing areas since pollutants discharged surpass the ability of natural purification, these places become unsuitable ones for people to live in. Noise pollution and atmosphere and water pollution are the major problems. People also suffer from the acid rain. Residents in some areas with river passing by will suffer from serious shortage of drink [wd2,1-] water because the river has been aggravatingly pollutted [fm2,-] and covered with floating rubbish.  	In the countrysides [np5,-] the placid pastoral life and tranquil environment have been damaged in line with the invasion of modern industries. The fresh atmosphere has been pollutted [fm2,-] and the clean streams are covered by the waste residue and water. Bad hygiene [wd2,1-1] conditions are the commonly existing components [wd7,s-] in rural areas.  	Manmade intervention also disrupts the ecological balance. Soil erosion, desertification, salinisation-alkalinisation [fm2,-] and land degradation emerge, which also worsen the disasters like droughts and floods. Besides, a tendency of increasing temperature and less rainfall stem [vp3,s-] from the destruction of massive grassland and forest, which also cause [vp3,s-] the changable [fm2,-] climate.  	In addition, we lost something precious that we can not obtain forever. It is reported that some materials in the tropical forest, which are the elements of medicine against cancer, Aids or other dangerous diseases disappear because of the deforestation. It is estimated that in the future our decendents [fm2,-] can only appriciate [fm1,-] regretly [fm2,-] the beautiful rare wildlife like tiger and red-crowned crane in pictures because they are now becoming extinct.  	Fortunately, humanity is finally aware of and face the degenerating environment. People nowadays realize how wrong they have done to nature and begin to take pratical [fm1,-] actions to protect environment. Various conferences on environmental protection were held. Laws on pollution control have been established. Some countries commence to concern about the endangered species and publish laws and regulations to ban illegal wildlife trade and set up natural reserve. Measures are taken to stop the vicious cycle of exhaustion of rescources [fm1,-] and the deterioration of the environment. Mankind tries to remodify [fm1,-] and co-ordinate the relationship between humanity and nature by saving natural rescources [fm1,-] controlling birthrate, promoting moderate consumption, implementing overall adjustment and control and restoring the ecology. A world-wide champaign [fm1,-] of environmental protection popularizes [vp1,s-] and more and more people join the issue. People contrive and manufacture rescource-saving [fm1,-] products and search for clean energy source. The concept of envionmental [fm1,-] protection even roots in the young generation. People consciously control their behaviours that may do harm to nature, lessen [vp1,-3] using plastical [fm2,-] bags or other products that may pollute envionment [fm1,-]  	Meanwhile, people reconstruct environment by afforestation and purifying water rescources [fm1,-] Some places which used to be garbage receptacles now become beautiful scenes. Some large-scale banks and companies invest numerous [np8,-1] capital to save the pollutted [fm2,-] rivers and scenery spots. Nuclear-power stations have been built and put into use, replacing the conventional, heavily pollutted [fm2,-] coal-power station. All these not only protect the enviornment [fm1,-] but also beautify our survival surroundings for a better life.  
(t9-17)  	I am not a feminist but I totally approve [vp1,-s-] those actions taken by the feminists to protect women and to seek equal status with men, because in varying degrees, women in the world are in a lower position than men and treated unfairly. This situation is urgently calling for improvement.  	For example, in China, girls are always at a disadvantageous position of enrollement [fm1,-] for primary schools, middle-schools and even universities. They have to achieve higher marks than boys so as to attract attention. It's an undeniable fact that women's intelligence is commonly dispised [fm1,-] and ignored. Imagine what a loss to human being [np6,2-1] if we couldn't have Mrs. Curie's great contibution [fm1,-] Women surely also have ability (if not equally great) to promote human development. Feminists [np4,s-] fight for women' equal opportunity to gain education is undoubtably [fm2,-] wise and beneficial.  	Concerning work, women have made greater efforts to get the jobs. The girl graduates are always less populor [fm1,-] no matter how hard they have worked through all these years, no matter how [wd3,-2] good marks they have achieved, only because their opponents are boys who were born to have the merit endowed by god [fm3,s-] And women also have to struggle for equal payment for the same amount of work. The unfair payment surely dampens women's enthusiasm for their professions, on the other hand, it encourages men's arrogance and unconscientiousness. What on earth [ad1,s-] good does this social unfairness brings to human [np6,s-] ? The depression of those enterprising women? The satisfaction of the incapable men? The whole draging [fm1,-] of human development?  	These social phenomenons [fm1,-] often trouble me. But [wd4,s-] women in some regions have more miserable fate even shock me vehemently.  	In Islamic countries, women have to wear veils all the time and wear long rob [fm1,-] letting [wd3,-] no part of body being seen by public [np7,1-] Women have no right to vote, to have their own profession, to take roles in the sports games. They are considered as personal property of men. Through efforts, women gained the right to hold the first women sports games in 1993. But, ridiculously, no men were allowed to watch any match in it, because the women had exposed their bodies. It seems that in Islamic countries, women's human [wd5,1-1] bodies are regarded as indecency. While in some regions of [wd3,1-1] Africa, a woman have [vp3,2-] to wear rings around their [pr3,s-] neck from a little girl [wd7,s-] and add [vp3,s-] rings every year so as to make the neck longer and longer. Only because their long neck is considered to be elegant, women have to torture themselves to please the men. Women have no identity at all in many places. They are only accessories of men.  	The situation has to be changed. When human [np6,1-1] is striking through all these centuries for development, this problem became [vp6,s-] more and more outstanding. Women should stand up to fight for themselves if god doesn't bless them. Feminists are pioneers in this move. They have gain [vp9,2-] some rights for women through years of striving. I personally think that this progress has profound and historic significance. Every step is a contribution to human development. 	  	But I also have to say that the best thing is always not extreme. I don't agree to those over-drastic proposals and actions. We fight equal rights for women. We don't fight for overwhelming previleges [fm1,-] for women and arouse Men's Liberation. Feminists should always keep their move on legal and reasonable light [cc4,1-] and fight with integrity but not hostility and prejudice. Human being [np6,1-1] is born equal, [wd7,s-] let all the men and women share the roughly (at least) equal rights on this earth.

(t9-1)  	I don't think feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good. In the past, women were universally looked down upon by men. The man was the master of the house. He should be respected and listened to by his wife. Women were considered housewives more than anything else. They were expected to stay at home, rear children and take care of the house. With regard to the children, boys were always cherished in a family. Girls could not do the same thing as boys did. They had no right to go to school, to go out and play with other boys and to do what they wanted. All they were permitted to do was to sit at home and to do some sewing. What a pitiful life they lived!  	Thanks to the feminists who have taken the lead to break through the outmoded convention, the position of women nowadsys [fm1,-] has ranked almost paralell [fm1,-] to that of men. The majority of women receive good education. They are doing what they like: taking up advertising, furnishing or interior decoration, studying science, medicine or law, etc. All these prove that women are obviously not inferior to men in their working ability. Nowadays, women live much happier lives than those of [wd5,-] long ago. They make friends with both sexes without feeling uneasy or embarrassed. They are respected and served by men in conventional circles where they enjoy [vp1,-3] together at conversation, games and amusements. They are no longer left at home by their husbands to look after their children and their in-laws [wd4,s-] to manage the house chore. On the whole, they have more freedom to choose what they like to do.  	To draw the conclusion, I think that both sexes should regard each other as equals. In fact, women have a lot of potentials. If given more opportunities, they can do more contribution [cc3,2-] to the society. In this aspect, feminists have played an important role.  (t9-2)  	I don't think this opinion is right. In countries like China and Japan, the males were much respected by the females. Although nowadays that old custom has been changed [wd4,s-] lot, to some extent, it still has some negative effect.  	At the present time, many women have become professionalists [fm2,-] A women [np3,1-] with high standard of education occupies herself with a profession, however, most of the time she would work on an employment with a salary which does not match up to her knowledge and qualification.  	Many people also have the old-fashioned idea that a married woman should stay at home to look after the house and that her education and knowledge should be a heritage for her children in later years. And her children need her discipline and guidance to form good, healthy charater [fm1,-] But what about the woman herself, [sn9,s-] if a woman with qualification and efficioncy [fm1,-] wouldn't be engaged in a profession, her knowledge acquired through several years of hard study would be wasted, [sn9,s-] I think it is unfair.  	Most women nowadays are able to be independent of a living. We can find women working with men in some fields of occupation, distinguish themselves by their ability, efficiency and cautiousness.  	Under such circumstance, feminists declaim [vp1,-s-] that women should be respected and be treated equally in every area. They fight [wd4,-] equivalent rights [cc3,1-] for women. In fact, they do good to women. Through their persistent struggle, women though not exactly above men in everything, are almost parallel to men in their social life as well as in their profession. Women work side by side with men and some of them even hold higher position than men do.  	I believe that in future women can aquire [fm1,-] rights that men have.  (t9-3)  	We are told according to the history book that long time ago there used to be a society in which men and women were cooperative and both sexes were living in peace. As time passed bit by bit, men came into power in a society little by little, and now in such an industrial society, it seems men are dominator [np3,2-1] in any fields [np6,1-] Thus feminism came into being in order to obtain equal rights with men. Unfortunately, feminists have been mistaking "equal rights" for "equal power", consequently they have done more harm to the cause of women than good.  	Let's look at the following facts that will confirm my opinion that women, with the help of "feminists", are living in even poor [aj3,2-1] situation. One fact is that the word "superpower woman" ("nu qiang ren") has come into being. What is a "superpower woman"? Well, such a woman should be both a capable housewife and an energy [wd2,1-1] boss. In a man-dominating feminism [wd2,s-] (I mean the idea or thought of that is controled [fm2,-] by men) movement, the situation can be easily interpreted as "she has traditional female virtue as well as modern ideas to be equal with men". But in my opinion that cannot be called "equal" and is overbear [vp9,1-2] for women. Another fact is that feminism have [vp3,s-] doubled the market of cigarette. I don't think it is a good habit to smoke heavily, as we all know that smoking do [vp3,s-] a great harm [np5,2-] to our health. Only men [wd3,s-] smoking is "bad" enough; women, demanding the same as men and joining such [wd4,1-2] smoking trend, is worse [wd7,s-] [sn8,s]. Maybe this example is not quite proper. I cite it only to prove that it [wd4,s-] unnecessary to equalize everything.  	An ideal society is one in which both sexes cooperate, help each other and live in harmony. To strive for such a society. [sn9,s-] we should not go beyond the proper limits in correcting an error. Now the error is that men is [vp3,1-] dominating the society. What we should do is to establish a new world in which women cooperate with men but not dominate men or do everything bad that men do.  (t9-4)  	In 1880, seeing her husband come into her bedroom, the honored empress had to kneel down before the emperor, calling herself *"his slave.**" In 1980, women walked with their husbands hand in hand, happiness shown on their faces. This great change would not have taken place without the persistent efforts of feminists.  	It was feminists who realized that the inequality between the two sexes were unjust and made other women conscious of their situation. Through lectures, advertisements and brochures, they call on women to struggle for their rights they deserve. It has been very hard because most men, accustomed to their predominance in the society, are strongly against the feminists. Even some women regarded [vp6,d] themselves inferior to men and can't understand why feminists want to be equal with superior men. The tradition has existed for a long time and is very forceful, But feminists' persistence has set a good example to women and encourges [fm1,-] them to be courageous and persistent.  	Besides educating women, feminists have been leading them to show women's anger towards the unequality [fm2,-] in terms of strikes and demonstration, which have been very forceful and effective. Their efforts have brought positive results. Lots of women have come out of their kitchens and have jobs in many fields such as politics, financial [wd2,3-3] sports and even astronomy which were dominated by men before. By doing so women are more independent than their ancestors and therefore more confident and happier than before.  	We should not forget that feminists have brought benifit [fm1,-] to not only the cause of women, but also the cause of men. By having jobs, women share men's great burden. Women are more equal [aj3,1-] with [wd3,4-1] men, which results in better communication. All this could not have been achieved without feminists.  	Feminists are continuing their efforts, trying to change some tokenism to real equality. I hope they will get more support from the society.

(t9-1)  	According to the dictionary feminism is the belief that woman should have the same rights, power, and opportunities as men. Feminists are those who believe in and support feminism. In my opinion feminists have done much good to the cause of women. Feminism helps to promote women's position both in society and family.  	As far as women's social status is concerned, nowadays there are quite a large number of female politicians, scientists, professors, doctors, etc. Women have almost entered every field of work. Politically speaking women have the same right to vote and be elected as men. Now female political leaders are not a rare thing [sn9,s-] as we see that [wd4,3-3] former British prime minister Tharcher [fm1,-] is a well-known woman politician. Some people' [np4,1-1] belief that politics belongs to men is no longer accepted by both men and women since many facts have proved this belief wrong. Thatcher is a good example. Economically speaking women are able to earn as much money as men. In the current of reforming women take up doing business as well as men and some get quite rich. It is no longer true that making money is men's task. Women can do the same. In addition girls can do as well as boys in school. Many teachers have noticed the phenomenon that in the early years of education girls averagely tend to receive higher marks than boys. This provides strong evidence for the idea that women and men are mentally equal though they cannot be physically equal. We have to admit that men are stronger than women with regard to physical strength. But this difference does not exist in the aspect of mental ability. Many girls get their MA or doctor's degree as well.  	Since in so many aspects women's ability is the same as men's, why should not women get the same rights and opportunities as men? Before women were liberated from the traditional view that women are born family caretakers, they were bound to their children, husbands, and families. They did housework all day long. No opportunity was provided for them to participate in social activities. Under such conditions how can women show their talent? We can be sure to say that many talented women lost the opportunity to become somebody. In this sense feminists have done much good to the cause of women because their belief contributes to the establishment of women's self-confidence and self-respect. Because of feminism women can have their own cause for which they exert themselves. Once offered the same opportunities as men, women are able to compete with men and even surpass them in some aspects. For example, teacher [wd3,-s-] seems to be one of the favourite professions for women. One reason may be that women are apt to love students due to their experience of looking after their own children. They may like to be with children to help them grow healthily, and to impart knowledge. Being a woman she possesses particular qualities that can never be found in a man. So it is unfair to say that women are inferior to men.  	Since all men are created equal, women should have the same rights, power, and opportunities as men. What feminists have done is greatly helpful to the cause of women. No one can disregard the achievement of feminism in discovering women's ingenuity for the society's use.  
(t9-2)  	As the social [wd2,2-1] develops [sn2,3-] Feminism becomes one of the social phenomena. What the feminists advocate is to improve the women's social status, make the women release [vp4,3-4] from the heavy housework and make the women have an equal opportunity to go to social [wd2,2-2] with man, and so on. In a word, feminists think the men and the women is [vp3,2-] equal. On the one hand, the phenomena reflect [vp1,-s-] that thoughs [fm1,-] of the women has been liberate [vp9,2-] [vp1,2-2] [cc5,-2] more furtherly [ad3,1-] [fm2,-] than before. On the other hand, the thoughs [fm1,-] has done more harm to the cause of women than good.  	In anciet [fm1,-] the [np7,2-3] women were consider [vp9,1-] as the humble classes [np6,s-] and machine of giving birth to children, [sn9,s-] the [np7,s-] women are [vp6,s-] inferior to men. For example the women were prevented from taking part in the anciet [fm1,-] Olympic Sports. Now the [np7,s-s-] women become an essential part of social [wd2,1-] The [np7,s-1] women not only can take [vp2,-2] part of the social action concerning political, economic, [wd4,-3] culture's [wd2,-2] field [np6,1-] the women [wd5,s-] but also can became [vp9,1-] managers, drivers, teachers, and so on. At present, social [wd2,-1] can't provide equal opportunity of employ [wd2,1-] with [vp2,5-5] the [np7,-] men to [sn8,s-] the [np7,-] women in a certain captimism's [fm1,-] [wd2,-1] country. Nevthless [fm1,-] the phenomena are less.  	While the completely equal [wd2,2-1] between the men and the women is out of the question [sn2,s-] First, the physical differnce [fm1,-] is existence [cc3,1-] On a [wd3,1-1] whole the [wd5,-1] men are strong, the [wd5,-1] women are weak, which lead the men to become the embodiment of strenghth [fm1,-] and make the men be equal to the heavy physical work [cc1,8-] [sn9,s-] nevthless [fm1,-] the [wd5,-1] women can't do it. Secondly the [wd5,-1] wen [fm1,-] usually are bravery [wd2,1-] and confidence [wd2n3-] the [wd5,-1] women are tender and cautions [wd2,4-] The characterises [wd2,1-1] of the wen [fm1,-] make the men be prone to work in the social [wd2,1-1] and the women stay at home to look after the children. If the men tend for [wd3,1-4] the child other than the women. [sn2,s-] Which neither [wd1,s-] embodies the advantage of the men nor embodies the advantage of the women. [sn2,s-] [wd7,s-] In a word, the distinguish [wd2,1-1] between the men and the women in social act [np6,2-l] is only social's [wd2,-1] difference [wd2,-1] distribution rather than discriminate [wd2,s-] the women. We must accept the difference between the men and the women.  	To some extent, the opinion which feminists emphasis [wd2,1-1] on is at the cost of the women's health. Beause [fm1,-] the women's power is limit [wd2,1-] in contrast with the men's power [sn2,s-] For example, the women [np4,1-2] world's [np4,2-1] champion of runing [fm2,-] 100m must [vp9,-]ran more slowly [ad3,-] than the men's world champion. If people consider the[wd5,-1]  wen [fm1,-] and the [wd5,-1] women as the same as feminists describe, the [wd5,-1] women will undertake the [wd5,-3] [cc3,1-2] more impression from the social [wd2,2-1] and theirself [fm2,-] It will enfluence [fm1,-] the women's health in a long term, [wd4,s-] what is more, minize [fm1,-] the men's effect on the faimly [fm1,-] and the social [wd2,1-] It is against what the feminists wish.  	Therefore, the view of feminists isn't [vp9,4-1] deserve standing absolutely. We must deal with the view of feminists correctly.  
(t9-3)  	Feminists could have appeared with the development of the society. About [ad1,s-] in the 1970's, feminists turn up [vp6,s-] in the advanced western countries. They stuck firmly to the feminism, the principle that women should have the same rights and chances as men. But contrary to our common sense, feminists were usually male other [wd3,4-2] than female.  	Feminists initiated the women movement to fight up [wd5,1-1] against those old-fashioned traditional concepts, and appealed to the society for men and women's equality. We could say its original meanings and aims were good. But actually, feminists have gone to extremes to exaggerate the women's status nowadays, so it's not surprising that feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good. Why should we think so?  	In the first [wd4,3-] social division of labour is different, and men and women have different ability. Many kinds of jobs, especialy [fm1,-] those jobs which need strength, don't suit to [vp2,1-] women. Although the society is advancing rapidly, many jobs tend to need wisdom other than strength, we still think so, for men and women have distinguishing [wd3,-] physiological characteristics. Women are superior at imagination, language, memory and feelings, but men are good at mathatics [fm1,-] physics, operation, and so on. If we could let men and women engage in [vp1,1-6] what jobs most suit to each other, this kind of rational division of labour would do good to the social advancement.  	In the second [wd4,3-] the name of women is titled [fm2,1-] by [wd5,6-2] 'the weak'. Women are like bird [np6,3-] but men are like tree [np6,3-] Bird [np6,-2] should hide under [wd3,-4] the shade of tree [np6,1-2] to avoide [fm1,-] the strong sunlight. It's the same situation to the human being. Feminists' opinions encourage women to compare with men [vp1,2-5] in all sorts of ways. We often run across such situation [np6,1-] : a woman possesses money and success of enterprise [cc1,2-] but in [wd3,-2] the same time loses her feminine qualities and doesn't look lovely as before. She gets married late, and [wd3,s-] even becomes a spinster. In essence, feminism is the mainly [wd2,-1] reason for such tragedy.  	At last, what's the true meaning of the cause of women' after all? Feminists usually limit its meaning to the liberation of women. In their opinions, women don't need to rely on men, women can earn enough money to support themself [fm2,-] women should work hard at their work, women can become manager [np6,3-] scientist [np6,s-] and even president [np6,s-] [sn9,s-] We couldn't say the view is wrong, but women's cause also include [vp3,3-] helping men with their enterprises, bringing up children. Men couldn't be pregnant. It is women's responsibity [fm1,-] to bring birth a new life [cc3,4-] to the world. If all the women gave up houswork [fm1,-] to climb along the career ladder, what would happen to the world? The family would break up frequently, divorce should happen, and the society would be unstable, then women couldn't get truly liberated [sn9,s-] When God makes man and woman, he expects them to help each other rather than fight up [wd5,1-3] against each other.  This is only my personal opinion, do you agree with me?  (t9-4)  	In most countries, feminist [np6,-2] have strugled [fm1,-] for the right for many years. So in most countries the role of women is changing. Today, many women are going into professions, such as medicine, low [fm1,-] engineering [wd4,s-] even police [cc1,4-] They comprise a large part of the workers in business and factories, and, in addition, they are working up to important jobs which used to be held predominantly by men. There are [vp3,-3] even some business which are [vp3,2-] run completely by women in some countries. However, they still run up against some roadblocks since many government jobs are closed to them, and certain jobs are not considered honorable for women. In general, they feel they are more liberated now and have an alternative to their old way of life. But these have rised [fm2,-] [wd3,s-] the satues [fm1,-] of women indeed?  	In some countries, such as Russia, over half the doctors are women, over 30 percent of the engineers are women, practically all the teachers are women, and women comprise over half the university students. But, the majority of manual laborers in Russia are women. In fact four-fifths of Russia's working women are engaged in physical labor. As in most countries, women predominate in the lowest paying professions.  	In plain terms, women such as china [fm3,3-] [cc1,3-] work hard. In some ways, Chinese women are rewarded for their hard work. They can rise to positions of prestige more easily than elsewhere. and [fm3,-s-] for the most part, they are [wd5,1-3] get equal pay for equal work. But the thing is not so good. Because women [wd4,1-2] prodominant [fm1,-] in the low-paying fields, they receive, actually, less money than man [np6,6-] In practice, women often find it difficult to rise to positions of leadership even in professions they dominant [wd2,1-3] in some countries, such as Russia. Although men comprise only 15 percent of all [wd4,1-1] people involved in helth [fm1,-] care, they [wd3,-s] are 50 percent of the medical directors, supervisors, and administrators. Although women comprise 55 percent of all collective farm workers, they are only 33 percent of farm management [wd3,s-]  	in [fm3,-s-] the [wd5,1-1] addition, feminist [np6,-1] is not to relieve the burden of women, [sn9,s-] on the countrary [fm1,-] inurese [fm1,-] it. Although women enter professions, they should do nearly all the housework in plain minds [wd7,2-] They are not only earning the money, but also watching the children washing. Every day, after their working, women can't have a rest like men. They have to prepare dinner, have to wash the plates and so [wd4,-]. In fact, women do the double of work.  	So we can say "faminist [fm1,-] [np6,-1] have done more harm to the cause of women than good".  
(t9-5)  	On account of history, some western countries such as America, England, and Iceland, have always an advanced culture in physically [wd2,1-] [wd7,s-] It makes a good chance for women in these countries to have a good education. The women in these countries always lead a life comfortable [wd1,2-] and wealth [wd2,5-] In physically [wd2,1-] they have almost melt [vp9,1-] Good education makes them have an intensive self-sense [wd7,2-] In some respects, they appeal for personality libration [fm1,-] strongly. But whatever [wd3,s-] the woman [np3,s-1] work hard [wd1,s-] at their cause, they always have run [vp6,s-] up against a few serious roadblocks in their successful road [cc1,1-] In practice, women often find it difficult to rise to [wd4,1-2] position of leadership in professions they dominate. At last, in order to obtain their rights, they alway [fm1,-] have a feminist. Although they have many reason [np3,1-] to do this, in general, in my view, feminist [np6,-1] have done more harm to the cause of woman than good.  	Though this is the world that man is advantagous [fm1,-] over women, in general, the society still advocate [vp3,4-] equality between man and woman. The socity [fm1,-] have [vp3,2-] given several "the lady first" conditions for women because of [wd4,2-2] differences both [sn8,s-] man and woman. But [wd4,1-2] feminist emplisises [fm1,-] woman's right too much. I think it is extreme [wd4,-] Let's suppose, once the feminist would success [wd2,1-] [sn2,s-] The woman [np3,s-1] have full rights to let man [np3,s-] serve [vp2,2-2] for them. It is not real equality. The men hate woman [np3,3-] and don't help them. It will [wd4,1-2] more harm to the cause of woman [np3,s-] than good. This is one hand [wd7,3-]  	On the other hand [sn2,3-] There are great differences in physiology between man and woman. For the woman, they are more fit [aj3,1-] for [wd4,1-2] family than woman [wd3,s-] [wd4,-2] Feminist over-emphsises [fm1,-] woman's political rights, and ignores act's [np4,1-1] in their family. This result will cause the disintegration of the family unit. The sociaty [fm1,-] would be out of order. The woman couldn't go in for their cause with soul and heart [wd1,3-] This would be great harm to women's cause.  	In conclusion, feminist [np6,-1] have done more harm to the cause of woman than good.  
(t9-6)  	Some people mind [wd3,s-] that the women's movement has brought about [vp1,s-] the [wd5,s-] women more harmness [fm2,-] than goodness [wd3,s-] but I think, [sn9,s-] the women's movement do [vp3,3-] to the women more good than harm.  	Before the women's movement women were considered following cultural tradition [sn8,s-] to be the best or most "natural" parents and were given [vp7,s-] custody of the children. In 1970s came finally the women's movement. The aim of the women's movement is to overcome the legal, economic, and other inequalities that have been termed institutionalized sexism. The leaders of [wd4,2-1] movement are mainly college-educated women. It's not surprising that these women are highly sensitive to attitudes and practices which try to limit women's work roles. In few short [cc4,1-1] years, they caused American society to start reexamining itself, influenced the government to pass antidiscrimination lows [fm1,-] in hiring and increased their following [wd7,2-]  	Women's liberation is surely to take place. As societies become more technologically advanced, sex roles change gradually, despite institutionalized sexism. Even in some traditionally male-dominated societies, women are moving toward equality.  	The most practical goals of the movement were [vp6,s-s-] to gain job equalities in pay and promotions, because people seem to feel that women's work is inherently unequal to men's. For [sn8,-s-] women can being [vp9,1-] free [vp9,s-] for [vp1,s-1] work outside the home, the women's movement has called for more child-care centres. These aims also require changes in the traditional family structure. Feminists believe that man should play a large role in housework and child care. These changes in the family life-styles would more equally [ad3,1-] socialize boys and girls and would decrease sex-role difference.  	Feminists are trying to change certain cultural myths as well. Two of these concern working women. The first is that working women are not as happy as housewives. But the fact is, [sn9,s-] more and more women worked [vp6,s-] and the working wives are much more optimistic about job roles. The second is that women working outside the home are less likely to have happy, stable marriages than housewives, [sn1,s-] this means that her [pr3,s-] job has a bad effect on her [pr3,s-] marriage. However, the young working women have slightly greater marital stability than those without jobs.  	On the other hand, because the leaders of the movement don't know well the condition of low-educated [cc4,1-1] women, their actions sometimes are not practically [wd2,2-2] and unreasonable, [sn9,s-] sometimes they go too far away [wd4,2-3] the practical life, those [wd7,s-] bring the women harmness [fm2,-] But those [wd7,d] are not mainly [wd2,2-]  	On the whole, the women's movement bring [vp3,2-] the equality to the women. Now women are not only housewives, they can also work as men, they have their own independent lives. So I mind [wd3,s-] the Feminists have done more good to the women than harm.  
(t9-7)  	With the progress of society, women have taken an important role in many areas. Although wearing tradition clothing and staying at home used to be the rule, today many women are going into professions, such as medicine, law and engineering.  	Feminists has [vp3,1-] grown rapid [wd2,s-] these years. In fact, I think the men and women should be equal in position of society, in human rights and personality, also in equal [wd5,s-] paying for equal job. But the leaders of feminists emphasis [wd2,s-] these too much. They think women should rise to positions of leadership in every areas [np6,1-] [sn9,s-] even in some what [pr5,s-] they couldn't do well.  	As a [wd5,1-1] women, they have their own characters different from men [sn4,s-] They do things carefully, they are warm-hearted, but they have limited physical and mental vitality. Some works [np5,s-] are fit for them to do and others not. They have their own home, they have to do housework and take care of children, [sn9,s-] this is a heavy burden. They couldn't have much time and energy to do heavy work, nomatter [fm2,1-] [wd4,2-4] in physical or in mental vitality. You can find those women insisting on feminists [wd3,s-] always end the day mentally and physically exhausted.  	I think our educated gentlemen could treat women equally in today's life. The government should offer some work which is easier for them to do. The women will have much time enjoying their happy life. Being an ordinary person [np3,s-] they could also do things which they care for in their spare time. In fact, feminists have done more harm to the women, whether in their work or in their daily-life.  
(t9-8)  	Feminists have strugled [fm1,-] for women's right in the [wd5,1-2] most countries for many years, and it has brought some right which only men can [vp6,-2] have before, [sn9,s-] for example, the women in the [wd5,1-2] many countries can do the same job as men, go to school and enter politics. Do these make [vp1,-6] the situation of women to rise [cc3,5-] indeed?  	As we know, women hadn't been allowed [vp6,s-] to work for few [wd5,s-] thousands of years, such as [sn8,s-s-] china [fm3,s-] in which the fedlism [fm1,-] has more than 2000 years of history, [sn1,s-] the concept [np6,s-] which Kongzi and Mengzi established have posses [wd3,s-] the main situation in many people's brain [cc1,4-] In that [pr3,-1] days, me [pr4,s-] [pr1,s-s-] held the seat of power [cc1,2-] Women was [vp3,1-] thought [vp1,s-] that they could only stay at home and do housework,they must be ruled by men.[sn1,s] It would be normal of [wd3,s-] a man hitted [fm2,-] a women [np3,1-] but conversely, if a man was striked [fm2,-] by a women [np3,1-] that women [np3,1-] would be denounced, even punished. So women hadn't right in any way. Although it is known by every people [cc4,1-] that the [wd5,1-4] man [np3,-2] and women is [vp3,5-] equal, furtherly [fm2,-] ensured by law [sn8,s-] but [wd5,s-] the traditional concept is very difficult to be changed competely [fm1,-] and rapidly.  	Some women in the professions consider working an honor and a privilege, but they don't abtain [fm1,-] the same right as men, [sn9,s-] although they can enter proffessions [fm1,-] such as medicine, architecture, and teacher [sn6,3-] they couldn't rise to [wd4,2-4] position of prestige more easily. In practice, it is very difficult, even in proffessions [fm1,-] they dominate. In the soviet [fm3,2-1] Union, although men comprise only 15 percent of all people involved in health care, they [wd3,s-] are 50 percent of the medical directors, supervistors [fm1,-] and ministrators [fm1,-] Although women comprise 55 percent of all collective farm workers, they are only 33 percent of farm magagement [wd7,s-] And, although most factory worker [np3,2-l] are women, the foreman would likely be a man.  	In the [pp2,1-1] addition, Femisnits [fm1,-] is [vp3,1-] not to relieve the burden of women, but to increase it. [sn9,-s-] for [sn8,-s-] the women entering [vp4,s-s-] proffessions [fm1,-] they not only watches [vp3,3-] the children, but also do cooking, washing. they [fm3,s-] are often involved in many trifles of their family. After the working is over, men may go home and have a rest, but they [pr1,s-] can't. they [fm3,s-] have to prepare dinner for her [pr3,s-] familsies' [fm1,-] and they must get to [vp2,1-] earlier than their husband for breakfast. So the women now do double of the work.  	According to these, the situation of the women hasn't risen [cc1,6-] indeed, and we expect that condition of the women's could be improved in the future.  
(t9-9)  	Firstly, I have to say that I can not agree with the given title. I believe feminists must have already done something beneficial to the cause of women. If not, why will the fourth world women's conference be held next year? We can find support from the 38th meeting held from March 7th to 18th by the United Nations' women's status committee.  	The preparatory meeting discussed the draft of 'the programme of action', and the detailed rules of procedure. The programme of action involves items concerning women's vital interests such as: sharing rights at different levels, participating equally in making political and economic decisions, enjoying equal pay for equal work to [wd3,s-] male workers, women's education and health care, elimination of violence towards women. [sn9,s-] etc [wd5,s-]  	The representatives pointed out that the World Women's Conference should be coordinated with the World Conference of Human Rights and the World Population and Development meeting which are to be held within two years. Deputy secretary-general of UN Desay said, the development level of a society can be measured by its women's position. Women's problems can be taken seriously enough and particularly undertaken [cc2,s-] only when they are brought into other important international conferences.  	Many deputies emphasized the importance for women to participate in various fields' decision: women must become fully equal citizens, taking [wd4,1-3] active part in lives of all walk [wd1,4-] and take responsibility for their society's and the world's future. It must be changed that men dominate organs of power and wield the power procedure. Yet in many countries now, the number of women leaders in governments, big enterprises and parliaments is reducing. Even in the United Nations, the percentage of women at policy making positions is only 13%, far less than 25%, the target percentage to be reached by 1995.  	Deputies from developing countries universally placed emphasis on [wd4,1-3] urgency of solving these problems: women's poverty, education and health care, especially for peasant women, old women, disabled women and women migrants and refugees. They pointed out that elimination of poverty is the question which claims precedence over all others. And women should be taught to read, and enjoy health care, including birth control.  	The problem of elimination of violence exists in developed countries as well. While women refugees suffering from chaos by wars are more likely to fall [vp1,-1] victim. [sn2,s-s-] If a peaceful environment without violence can not be ensured for women, all the efforts promoting equality and development will turn out to be futile.  	Since the whole world become [vp3,3-] more and more serious on the issue of women's position. [sn9,s-] how can someone say feminists bring more harm to women than good?  
(t9-10)  	In the Bible, it is stated that everybody is equal before the God, no matter how poor or rich he/she is, no matter how strong or week he/she is. Accordingly, "All men are equal" as it is said by George Orwell, [sn9,s-] thereby, everybody in the world has the right to live, to be educated and to defend himself/herself, and disabled persons are treated equally as normal people, they can live and enjoy themselves as anyone else.  	Therefore, all the newly-born babies seem to be equal to each other, but their futures are heavily influenced by their individual family background, social background and one's personal efferts [fm1,-] that is the reason why some of them are more likely to have opptunities [fm1,-] than others, and they are easy to reach their goals. With or without great personal efferts [fm1,-] which is the implication of George Orwell's statement --- "Some are more equal than others."  	When a baby first comes to this world, he/she knows nothing about our world, but something destine [wd2,1-1] will happen to him/her so that he cannot avoid them even though he/she wants to change them. For example, [wd4,-2] complexion is a character of a nation, [sn1,s-] people with different complexions should be equal as they are all live creatures created by the [wd5,1-1] God, but things are not always as what we had [vp6,s-] imagined. In a multi-nationality country, minorities are always looked down upon, and fewer chances of employment, as well as poorer education are supplied to those minorities. In the United States, the laws have admitted the equality between peoples of different colors. there [fm3,s-] is still a long distance between the real society and the ideal model of the laws.  	In the world, many people in Africa are going hungry, sometimes even suffering from starvation, but some people in other continents are enjoying themselves without taking money into consideration. Even in the same country, people with the same complexion also differ a lot in acquiring opptunities [fm1,-] and carrying out their rights.  	On the other hand, family background plays an important role in one's realization of ego [cc1,2-] For example, every university graduate should be equal, then equal opptunities [fm1,-] can be awarded to them to get a commonly desired job, but in fact, those who have better family background are more likely to get the job no matter whether they are more capable or not than others, which is one of the phenomena metioned by George Orwell --- Some are more equal than others.  	But the most important factor in one's life is one's personal striving and struggling, which makes him/her "more equal" [aj3,1-] than others no matter what social and family background he/she has. Obviously, the process of reaching the destination requires more efferts [fm1,-] and endurance, [sn9,s-] maybe, those who have no family background will fail several times more than those who have in the whole process[wd7,-] [sn9,s-] they should endure the failures and never be disappointed to realize their egoes [fm2,-] [cc3,2-] With those great efferts [fm1,-] their futures are promising. Once they succeed, they will be given more opptunities [fm1,-] as we always give more to those who have much and take away from those who have little [wd7,s-] thus their prevails [vp4,s-] over others will remain and affect [vp1,-2] a lot for a long time. Then, they are "more equal" [aj3,1-] than others.  	So, everyone should struggle from [wd3,s-] him/herself, especially for [wd5,s-] those without good family background. Only with striving and great efferts [fm1,-] [sn9,s-] can we make ourselves "more" equal to others.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH B2W> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> 
(b2w-t9-1)  I am not in favor of this idea totally. I think feminists have done good to women themselves and [wd4,s-] society, to some extend [pp2,2-] to family and children.  As we all know, women's position was very low in the past. They were inferior to men. They were men's accessorise [fm1,-] First they must abide by their fathers; then be faithful to their husbands. After husbands died, they must depend on their male children. So women's fate was tightly connected with men's fate. Especially in feudal China, women smiled with mouthes [fm2,-] closed; they never dare to go out of their houses alone. Or they would be considered dissipated. There were so many codes of ethics that women should follow that women's potentiality couldn't be brought into full play. God creates women and men to develop society together. Without women's efforts, productive forces couldn't be promoted very quickly. So slave and feudal societies were backward and poor, while capital [wd2,-3] and social [wd3,-1] societies developed very quickly. To some extend [pp2,2-] it's due to women's emacipation [fm1,-] Some jobs do need to be done by women. Women are more intuitive than men.   In addition, once women go outside to work, they are economically independent, which makes them break away from men's control. They are never men's accessories again. Feminists help women to gain more and more rights. In China they can go to college; they have the vote right; they are entitled to be paid equally for equal work. That was unthinkable in the old China. Now when you enjoy Olympic Games, do you know that women were forbidden to participate in it in the beginning? Fact [np6,s-] proves that women not only [wd1,s-] can do it, but also can do it well. Especially [ad2,s-] Chinese female athletes win more honor for their motherland.   Someone may say, "If parents all go to work, no one will take care of children." Yes, perhaps parents can't spend more time caring about children. But mothers don't reduce their love to children. And children also need paternal love. Why can't fathers and mothers take care of Children [fm3,s-] together? Meanwhile double income will make family [np6,2-3] live a rich, happy and comfortable life. Isn't it a good thing?   Anything, only if it fits the development of history, can survive in society. I think women's emacipation [fm1,-] is unavoidable.    (b2w-t9-2)   Since the 1960s, feminism has improved women's life in many respects. It has been encouraging them to work more diligently, to tap their potential, to make them become more aware of their own existence.   Feminism has also affected men's life in many respects. It shakes the absolutely dominant position of men. Their wives who used to be docile are no longer obedient. Men find their power weakening. Of course they feel a sense of crisis. Someone says: "Feminism do [vp3,1-1] more harm to the society than good", which I don't fully agree to.   Some women are totally independent. They think they can manage their life without men's help. Only themselves [pr4,s-] are important. Husbands, children are not their business. They live by themselves and they like this way of life.   Some other women feel like [pp1,1-5] that their life is complete only when they are at men's side. They lose themselves in the light of men. Their roles in the society are only husbands' wives and sons' mothers. They live on their husbands just like vines crawling on the trees.   I think this is their own choice which other people shouldn't put their fingers in, though I personally don't like the two kinds of life. They are too radical.   In my opinion, the true meaning of feminism is: It is really very important for a woman to keep a kind of intimate, friendly and deep relationship with a man, but such relationship shouldn't be all she wants. There are many other important things to do. Feminism is aimed to help women develop themselves, help them become confident of themselves as independent human beings, to help them get the most benefit from their career, from social and individual life.   I don't understand why some people say that feminism do [vp3,2-3] more harm to the society than good. Are they afraid of it? Actually feminism liberates both men and women. When a woman can take care of herself, she has lessened the man's heavy burden. If they both work hard, both support the family, both look after the children, the burden will be halved. If they share the joy, the joy will be doubled; if they share the sorrow, the sorrow will be halved.   Feminism is misunderstood and misinterpreted by some people. This is the reason that [pr51-] some people say that feminism do [vp3,2-3] more harm to the society than good.  (b2w-t9-3)   What is woman? This is a question even more puzzling than Sphinx's riddle. In history, or rather his story, man tyies [fm1,-] to put forward a satisfactory answer [sn9,s-] One incarnation of woman, in man's eyes, may be Pandora, who was a union of beauty and evil, stupidity and temptation. She opened the forbidden box and brought plaques [wd3,s-] and unhapiness [fm1,-] to mankind. In order to control the dangerous opposite sex, man [np6,s-] either grabs a whip as what Nicher said, or convinces woman [np6,s-] that as a rib of the Adams, she is intellectually inferior and physically weaker. Nevertheless, some men and many women who may be called feminists, stick to their own philosophies. They believe that women are individuals as men, they should have roles separet [fm1,-] from those of wife and mother as men do. One of them, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, even boldly attacked what she called the male bias [np2,-1] of [wd3,3-1] Bible, and published her " Women's Bible". Surely such radical ideas as well as the extrem [fm1,-] language would be hotly debated. That is why some people stronly [fm1,-] critisized [fm1,-] [vp1,-s-] [vp6,s-s-] that feminism has done great [aj3,2-2] harm than good to the cause of women.   Believe it or not, it is a fact that girls this day are much more happier and freer than their mother or grandmother, although they still confront some problems such as less oppertunities [fm1,-] of employement [fm1,-] than boys, smaller pay and limited scale of career, and abortion etc. More credit should be given to the feminists.  When women realized maternity, the biological role of them has troditionally [fm1,-] been regarded as their major social role, and the law written by men who were stongly [fm1,-] influenced by that stereotype turned out unfaveralb [fm1,-] and unequal to them, they began to fight for vote and for the chances to be legislators. After a long period of struggle, in June 1919, U.S. Congress finally passed the women's suffage [fm1,-] bill and the 19th Amendment to the constitution became law on Aug.26 1920. Some 25 million women in U.S. had [vp6,s-] won the right to vote. [wd4,-3] Same victory had [vp6,s-] been gained in Great Britain and other parts of the [wd5,2-1] Europe later. In China, the New Cultural movement [fm3,s-] also brought a sort of emacipation [fm1,-] to women. "New woman " came to be used in the popular press and widely spread.  As time goes by, feminists never stop their pursuit of full equality for women. In 1966, Betty Eridan, the auther [fm2,-] of the famous "Feminine Mystique" organized the National Organization for Women ( NOW )in U.S., it agitated for such improvements as child-care for professional women who wanted to work. They also lectuered [fm1,-] lobbied in congress, and filed legal suits against sex discrimination.  Socialists are usually feminists or the supporters of the feminism, because they believe a cooperative society would show respect to the right of women, so in China, women are supposed to hold up the half of the sky.   Since nothing is perfect, feminism itself certainly has some troubles to deal with. For example, does the equality means the end of the the [wd6,1-] family and home? Was it expressed in the way that all the difference between man and woman has to be abolished? Is it possible for women and men [vp4,s-] live in peace? To sum up all of these, women like men have to think of one question first [sn9,s-] that is, "What is woman?"  There is a [np7,-1] old chinese [fm3,2-1] saying, which goes like "more and less are equally bad", it is quite important for feminists [vp4,s-] pay much attention to the limit of their efforts. Anyway, we are the world, we can do without the opposite sex, neither man nor woman.  (b2w-t9-4)  In recent years, feminism has achieved many of its goals. Women began to be treated in a really equal way. Still, there are many negative opinions, one of which is that feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good. In my opinion, it is insensible to hold such an attitude, as we can conclude from the analysis of the present conditions of the feminism [wd2,1-1] movement.   As we all know, through the persistant [fm1,-] struggling of all these years, feminism has alrealy [fm1,-] gone a long way towards success. Society comes to recognize the claims of women's rights equal to those possessed by men. Women begin to cut [vp2,1-2] smart figures in all fields. There are more and more successful woman [np3,-1] scientists, artists, journalists, and even politists [fm2,-] in recent years. In the fields which used to be regarded as man's privilege, women are making contribution not less than men. For example, in the past, women in many countries were forbidden to take activities which made them appear in public, especially in muslim [fm3,1-1] countries. But now, even in these muslim [fm3,1-1] countries, there are several woman [np3,-2] political leaders, and they are doing a good job. It was impossible in China a century ago that a woman had the right to refuse the marriage imposed on her by her parents, that she could refuse to become a life-long widow if her husband died without society's condemnation. However, in today's China, people feel natural if they know that some [np9,-1] woman divorces her husband because it is well-known that women have already had the right to choose their companion. This right was possessed only by men in old times. In Turky [fm1,-] where women were always forbidden to show any part of their body except eyes in public occasions [wd5,2-] women are adopting some western custume [fm1,-] to beautify themselves. Women's legal rights have been claimed after centuries of oppression from religious dogmas.  Whenever new-born things mad [fm1,-] their appearences [fm2,-] there is always great pain. The same is the case of feminism. The history of feminism is a history of struggling and overcoming unfavorable conditions. Every step they take is surely confronted with strong objections, which will certainly bring difficulty to the cause of women. It is not out of expectation. For instance, feminists' effort has gained much job opportunities for women, but new problems arise. Women have to deal with a series of new problems as soon as they get their long-aspired [fm2,-] freedom and rights. They are now almost free from chores, but the old relationship with their family has to be changed or even destroyed, which doesn't mean happiness at all. They now have their right to work, but at the same time the privilege of women are [vp3,3-2] also deprived of. In the past, women enjoy [vp6,3-] much convenience when having child [np6,1-] Nowadays, women are given [vp1,s-] [vp7,-] [cc2,s-s-] to know that they must take responsibility as man do [vp3,2-] Thus their maternity leave becomes as short as possible. In [wd4,s-] society, they are not in a position to be protected and taken care of by men, but they have to take care of themselves now. Furthermore, in some cases, because of prejudice, women are treated even more unfairly.  All that has been written shows the unfavorable conditions of feminism, but they are temporary. They are the troubles whose solvement [fm2,-] will lead to success, because the essence of feminism is perfectly correct. In addition, the achievement of feminists is also a plausible proof of their contribution to the cause of women. Through this movement, human beings will make a [np7,1-1] important step towards equality. Regarding long-term happiness, we will undoutedly [fm1,-] choose feminists as our pioneers to make benifit [fm1,-] for women and for human beings.  (b2w-t9-5)   Feminists have played an important role in promoting the social status of women. But today, their activities have been bringing damages to the cause of women.   First, feminists appeal for eqality [fm1,-] between man and woman, ignoring social divisions. As we know, many jobs can be done better by man than by woman. But many are in nature the speciality [fm1,-] of women. It doesn't mean any difference in social status, but in social division. If any woman assumes that the jobs dominated by men show high social status, she can try to do it. If she can't do it well, she should not have any complaint. But feminists have the prejudice that [wd4,s-] society offers unequal chance and right for man and woman [pp1,3-] namely [wd4,s-] society favours man instead of woman. What they think about influences a great deal in women's mind. So many women don't do the work they are fit for while taking the job they can't necessarily do well.   Second, feminists think that women's rights should be specially protected. They set up many organizations in the name of protecting women's rights. Actually, it is redundant to do so. It is known to all that people are equally protected by law, regardless of man or woman. As for casual violation of women's rights, women can resort to the law. So, we can safely say that women are enjoying equal rights today. What's more, women tend to have advantage over man [np6,6-] Maybe in the future man will launch a movement of man's emancipation. Is there anyone who wants to see such a matter? Definitely not. It will do nothing good to [wd4,s-] society but to waste [vp4,s-] time and money.   On the whole, it's needless to specially advocate the protection of Women's rights today. It will be better for women's cause if feminists stop appealing for women's equal rights which are actually equal.

(t10-1)  Two hundred years ago, some distinguished people brought forth on the North American continent, [sn9,s-] a new nation, dedicated [cc3,-3] to the proposition that all men are created equal.   Two hundred years later, people all over the world still struggle for equality. In a sense, we might say that, [sn9,s-] all men are equal, but some are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.   Firstly, to some extent, it appears that all men are equal. Human beings, male or female, tall or short, plump or slim, beautiful or ugly, clever or stupid, are equal. Not a single person can escape from death. Not a single person can live without air. Not a single person can fly to Mars without a space shuttle. Because we belong to the same species, we are [wd4,1-1] same, we are equal. All of us have the desire for eating and drinking. All of us live on the earth and shone [vp7,s-] by the sun.   However, we are not exactly the same. In addition, we have a lot of differences. That is to say, we are not equal all the time. Inequality comes from everywhere. Although we must die at last, some people were cut off in the prime of their youth, while others lived to over one hundred. Although you worked much harder than your boss, you suffered from poverty while he continued to lavish with money. For a long time, black people served as slaves while white people who are [vp6,s-] slave-owners enjoyed wealth without working. For a long time, women were deprive [vp9,2-] [vp1,2-5] the right of being educated, and, in some Arabian countries, they were forced to cover their face with veil when going out. According to the law, diplomats, who was [vp3,2-] [vp6,s-s-] convicted of murder in the [np7,s-2] foreign country, are free from punishment. You will not deny the facts above. There can be no doubt that, [sn9,s-] some people are really more equal [aj3,1-] than others.   The attractive goal of equality have [vp3,5-] not yet been achieved.   When thousands of ordinary people were in danger because of disaster, war and threat of violence, President Clinton stayed comfortably in the White House, with hundreds of bodyguards around him. Furthermore, not Clinton but the state was to pay this bill. Because he is [wd4,2-1] president, and [wd5,s-] he is more equal [aj3,1-] than you. Beause [fm1,-] he is [wd4,2-1] president, he can exercise a power of veto of the decrees while you can just obey. In the United States, only those who are backed up by millionares [fm1,-] could probably be elected as the candidate [np3,s-] for president [wd3,s-] So men of means are more equal [aj3,1-] than you. Racial discrimination is proved to be the most suitable illustration to demonstrate the problem of inequality. At present, negroes [fm3,-] in South Africa and some other places still suffered [vp6,s-] from discrimination and segregation. They don't have as many equal rights as white people do. They have been tortured; they have been looked down upon; they have been driven from the schools. In America, citizens of colors [np5,2-] tend to have less oportunity [fm1,-] of accessing the higher social class. Because they are judged by their color of skin but not their content [wd7,d] [sn2,s-]   In conclusion, in a sense all men are equal. But in fact, some are really more equal [aj3,1-] than others.  
(t10-2)   Despite the saying: "All men are created equal", no absolute equality exists among human beings, whether in China or in other countries. There are always some who are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.   Power corruption is a worldwide problem. Those in power exchange it for money or convenience. In a seaside city of China, the ex-mayor was so powerful that no one dared to accuse him of power abusing. He owned a beautiful modern house and had a huge bank account. His salary couldn't provide him with these things. The money, of course, came from back-door or other improper means. His two sons both engaged in smuggling. The customs knew, but did not check [wd3,-]them. They were the privileged class. Because they had power plus money, they were more equal [aj3,1-] than others. Only when their father fell out of power were they arrested.   It was reported that of the smuggling cases, at least 50% involved the government organizations, state-owned companies or even China's foreign offices abroad. In some cases, the public fund was used to smuggle. The smugglers met less trouble by securing the power protection[cc1,1-].   Things are no better abroad.   Political scandals --- mostly the exchange of power for money or the other way around, are so common in Japan that its people lose confidence in the government.   Nothing can illustrate "some people are more equal than others" better than the American presidential election. The US constitution declares that every citizen has the right to vote and be voted. The truth is, unless one has strong financial support, he can never hope to be voted. For a common US citizen, he has to work at least 10 years for a house of his own. Then he raises a family and lives from hand to mouth. He can never hope to possess that enormous sums [np3,s-] of money to run the presidential election. There is no fair play. "This is understandable", someone said, "otherwise, what's the use of money and power? Share it with the public? Work for it? Almost impossible!"   The same is with education. If one has enough money, he can buy himself an education. He is more equal [aj3,1-] than those who have not.   Diplomats stationed in other countries enjoy a special right: They can commit crimes without being punished. The most [aj1,-s-] they get is to be expelled. They are more equal [aj3,1-] than others before the law.   In fact, the same goes for almost every field of life, in the past or at present, here and abroad. George Orwell summarized it: All men are equal, but some are more equal than others.  
(t10-3)  "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others". This shocking slogan comes from Animal Farm and it is a typical black humor. Those clever animals, or somebody else, creat [fm1,-] the usage --- more equal, [aj3,1-] knowing that they are smearing the innocent word. I cannot help being stunned by their intelligence, they are skillful language-users and can express their ideas in a way beyond our imagination. I, like the rest of the world, am so naive that I only know "unequal" before I come across "more equal". [aj3,1-] But now I know more. (the "more" here is not the "more" in "more equal" [aj3,1-] ) [pr1,-] It reminds me of somebody, or to be exactly [wd2,2-] some country. Before it got independence, freedom and equality, it exclaimed to the whole world that it would struggle for them [pr1,s-s-] at any price. "Let's fight for justice" --- it's right, we are born equal, we are endowed with the rights to fight for the rights we deserve. So people all over the world stood up to support it, they sent all they had to help it: their food, clothes, medicine, even their husbands and sons. And they at last brought it to the sunlit path of equality. It succeed [vp6,1-] and became a young and powerful country. But now its greedy heart said [vp6,4-] to itself that it wanted [vp6,s-] more, maybe at the very begining [fm2,-] it said so, we don't know [sn1,s-] It wanted [vp6,s-] more rights, or another word "more equal [aj3,1-] ". It wanted [vp6,s-] to be equal in using other countries' natural resources as those countries themselves. And it also wanted [vp6,s-] to be equal in governing other countries as their own governments. That's what "more equal [aj3,1-] " means. It caused [vp6,s-] the world-wide condemnation. And now it had got [vp6,s-] what it deserved as it's rewarding [wd7,s-] and I think I needn't [sn8,s-] point out its name, let it become the history and let's forget it.   But we just cannot forget it. The arroundings [fm1,-] are repeating the same story in various ways. Even from a single person we can see the shadow of "more equal" [aj3,1-] The most common "more equal [aj3,1-] " are [vp3,5-] corruption. I don't know if we can say "more corrupt", but surely some are corrupt enough to be called "more corrupt" if we have this usage. Some high government officials make full use of their rights to be "more equal [aj3,1-] ". They live in villas and when they go out they use cars, their sons or daughts [fm1,-] also share the "more equality" to make more money. It's unfair and dangerous, "government of the people, by the people and for the people" should be the most just [aj3,2-] and honest government. Otherwise the people will overturn it. We have officials in the government in order to control and promote the country, improve people's living standards, not to exploit people. We have realized it and have done something. But what remains before us is still a long road.   Because life to everybody is a hard work, composed of laugh [np6,2-2] and tears [sn2,s-] But the latter one is much more than the former. So be kind to others as well as to oneself [wd3,s-] Struggle for one's equality, [sn1,s-] and when you enjoy it [sn9,s-] don't forget to treat others equally. Someone just cannot bear [vp1,-s-] that sun shines on everybody. In that case he'd better go into the basement to have his own special right of enjoying darkness. We are all children of God. We are brothers and sisters. We should remember: we are equal, no one is less equal, and no one is more equal [aj3,1-]  
(t10-4)   Equality has been long saught [fm1,-] after ever since mankind was conscious of its indispensibility [fm2,-] as one of the nuclei of human rights. Human beings long for equality which they believe [wd4,s-] destined. This can be best examplified [fm1,-] by that notable Declaration of Indepence [fm1,-] in 1774 in which the fourteen Bristish [fm1,-] colonies in North America advanced the idea as to [pp1,1-5] all men are created equal.   But, more than two decades have now passed, and I am forced to say that mankind is still lumbering on its way to the paradise of equality. History has seen too many tragedies in which devotees of equality fall victims to the antithetic forces mounted by those frantic authoritarians who cling to the notion that still some men are more equal [aj3,1-] than the other [pr3,7-] if they will agree that all men are equal at all. This is the notion reflected in one of George Orwell's book [np6,4-] : The Animal Farm. The book recounts the ups and downs of an animal farm where rebellion finally broke out when the high-pressure rule of the animal king was unbearable. But the animals did not enjoy the expected peace and happiness after they turned over the king because the new king, one used to be among them, turned out to be even more domineering. He preached that some were more equal [aj3,1-] than the other [pr3,7-] in the quaint hope of cooling down the mounting furiousness of the mass.   It is easy to draw something common to mankind from this story. It is impossible for human beings to be equal with each other insofar as personal interest and wealth, together with social status are concerned. Our world is a material one, but it cannot afford to guarantee equal treatment to every person. Wealth rains down on the rich; power attaches to the bigwigs; respect goes to the noblemen. This seems to be the constant scheme of human life. Can it be possibly altered?   The answer will never be consent [cc4,5-] as long as there are the rich among the majority [cc1,-1] poor. The answer is no as long as someone sits on the very top of a humble group brandishing his symbolic cane. The answer will never be yes unless the world drips with abundant wealth and opportunity for everyone's demand.   Every nation has been striving for a more secure and prosperous vista. In the course of developing economy and building up strength, nations on the earth and people of these nations should bear in mind the age-old desire for equality which is still languishing for full blossom one day.   But for the time being, a material prosperity throughout the world, which is one of the essential basis for valid equality, has not yet appeared. With this respect [pp2,2-] equality can just be a good wish for all concerned and some people in certain corners of the globe still has [vp3,s-] to face discrimination; [sn9,s-] be content with oppression, and wallow in despair. Let's pray for those suffering. Let the world grant them a wish for the best: be equal at last --- one divinist [fm2,-] thing World has not possessed.  
(t10-5)   After the liberation, the Chinese people became the host [np3,5-] of the country. Later, the constitution was promulgated, providing that all citizens are equal. But I would like to say that in China today, some people are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.   What on earth makes the Chinese unequal? Power and money. Though the Chinese Communist Party had made great resolution [np6,2-] to root out the leader's abusing their power, the problem is till very serious. Quite a number of Party members and leaders ignore the party discipline and the law of the state. They make good us [fm1,-] of their privilege to get what they want. Their families and relatives can also enjoy many privileges. It's very easy for them to enter some good institute or state-run company. Suppose you are the head of the institute you'd better not to infringe upon their privileges if you don't want to meet the trouble [cc3,2-] I learn that in the Silk Corperation [fm1,-] of the Foreign Trade Committee in Dong Guang city, there is about half of the stuff [wd3,s-] who are the leader's [np6,s-] families or relatives. Most of them are not needed at all. The leadership of the corperation [fm1,-] have to find some work to be done by them. Then, it comes out that a work [np5,1-] which should be done by one person was divided into 3 parts and done by 3 persons. All this trouble was taken to please some leaders. On the country [fm1,-] if you were a common people, even you had college certification, and you are [vp8,s-] exactly the company [np4,1-1] need, it would still be very difficult for you to enter [vp1,s-] into it. So, the leaders and their relatives are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.   The second cause of unequality [fm2,-] is: money. Suppose you had a child who were at the age of 3 or 4, and should go to kindergarton [fm1,-] Of course, it's quite normal that every parent want [vp3,2-] [vp1,-s-] their child has [vp4,3-] the best education. But if you had not quite a lot of money, you shouldn't hope that your child can [vp8,s-] stay in the best one [pr1,s-] It needs money to bribe the board of the kindergarton [fm1,-] so that your child could be received. It also needs money to pay your child's cost in the kindergarton [fm1,-] which is not cheap at all. If you had not so much money, you can [vp8,s-] only sent [vp9,2-] your child to a bad, or at least, not so good one. Then, your child grown [vp5,s-] up, [sn9,s-] it's time for him to go to university. Unfortunately, he failured [fm2,-] in the Entering College Exam. If you had money, you could still help him to receive the college educaion [fm1,-] But if you couldn't support the extra expenditure --- which is really a large sum for a common worker --- your child would have no choice, he could only enter sociaty [fm1,-] to earn his living. The gap between the rich and the poor is exit [wd3,1-] The rich is more equal [aj3,1-] than the others.   Insofar as I am concerned, I don't think the unequality [fm2,-] will disappear in the near future. Perhaps there will be real equality in the communist society?  
(t10-6)  The famous word of "All men are equal, some are more equal than others" is really an alternative way to say "not all the men are equal". It is very true today if we cast our eyes on the society we are living in.   When we look at the whole world, it may not be difficult for us to discover that some men are more equal [aj3,1-] than others as concerning the colors [np5,s-] of them.[sn8,s] When God decided to create human being, he created inequality in advance. He intentionally made them into different colors. So we have white, yellow, black, brown peoples. Then he even unfairly and unreasonably put them to different circumstances, providing the whites with the fertile plains, favourable climate, fat sheep and horses and rich natural resources and the blacks with barren deserts and a harsh living condition. This is the inequality in Nature, it is not directed by any human's will. But deplorably enough, thousands of years passing away, the deep-rooted racial unjustice [fm1,-] and inequality are still popular. This time, the God is far beyond reproach. So we have Martin Luther King's influential nation-wide boycott asking for equal rights in 1960s. Still today, people were [vp6,2-] shocked by the nutorious [fm1,-] scandle [fm1,-] of Rodney King's case which happened in Los Angles, the USA, a country that is long viewed as the beacon of freedom and democracy. To say nothing of these so-called less democratic nations. [sn2,s] Let's look at the condition in Somali, a country which is almost destroyed by hunger and wars. Its people are starving to death. Plagues and femine [fm1,-] are wide-spreaded [fm2,-] Every morning they wake up and find that they are living in the great terror of being killed or starved. These people are even deprived of the most fundamental right of a person --- the right of life, how can they be equal to others?   Even within the same racial society, we still have many "big" men who are alway [fm1,-] more equal [aj3,1-] than others. It is no doubt that every democratic government declares in their constitution "All men should be equal." While [wd5,s-] as far as wealthy [wd2,3-4] social position are involved, this can not be true. Every society has its privileged class which is made up of a number of big fish. They usually get more economic opportunities and political advantages which can not be obtained by every common countryman. This year, in Indonisia [fm1,-] the names of the ten richest person [np3,3-] in the country have been put in order to show to the public. Not surprisingly, there out of the ten are the children of Mr Suhato, the nation's president. More [wd3,s-] I do not deny their ability to become rich. But I would not doubt that they were less likely to be as they are now if they didn't have any strong support behind.   So no matter in what society, the absolute equality is impossible. Maybe the beautiful dream of "All men are equal" is always a distant destination for us to strive for.  (t10-7)   In his novel "ANIMAL FARM", George Orwell told us that the oppressed animals rose up and overthrown [vp4,s-] the Black Pig, a crude, unjust, violent tyrant. More significantly, they destroyed the board on which "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others" was written. It was true that the board had been pushed over, but it is also true that the words on it did not rot away with the wooden board, and it is still appliable [fm2,-] today.   "All men are equal" is a long-lasting dream for which so many people, both in [wd4,1-1] west and in [wd4,1-1] east, have fought. One can find many examples in history: The American in the Independence War, the Negroes in the Civil War and the oppressed and exploited Chinese in the Liberation War all fought bravely and hard to win their equal rights.   The aged-old [fm2,-] dream has always been in all men's heart and still will be as long as they exist. For even today, "all men are equal" remains a hope. It is till true that some are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.   Those who own power are more equal [aj3,1-] than others. They take advantage of the power they seized or given to them by people. Once they held any leading position, they think themselves superior [aj2,-1] than others, ordering others to do what they like, not considering others' interests. Furthermore, if ther [fm1,-] are objected [vp1,s-] or protested [vp1,s-] they would, within the region of their power, use all kinds of means to force his will to be obeyed. So, it produces an unequal scene: some men are above others. Such a condition easily leads to corruption which is existing among any government. Let's have Japan as an example. Nearly during every term of government, there were some corruption scandles [fm1,-] some of which led to the fall of the government. If some figures in the government, who of course have [vp6,s-] certain power, were not more equal [aj3,1-] than others, who would have sent money to them and bid [vp1,s-] them for help?   Apart from the persons who have power, the rich are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.   Nowadays, the world is more and more dominated by money, which means that the more money you have, the more rights you have and the more equal [aj3,1-] you are. Look at those millionaires, who can go from the U.S. to Swiss to have a holiday while ordinary workers are working hard to make a living. If they are in the mood, they can buy all the tickets of an amusement park for one night and enjoy themselves madly, just like the popular singer Mickle Jackson, which may deprive so many others of their happiness of playing in that park that night. In some places, enough money enables you to do whatever you like, including even committing crimes without punishment. Therefore, it is obvious that they are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.   In some strange conditions, some people are more equal [aj3,1-] than others merely because of their colour of skin, even though they are neither rich nor having any power. Martin L King's dream hasn't fully realized.   A world in which all men are equal remains a dream in everybody's heart. When will it become true?  (t10-8)   "Every [wd3,-3] people are equal, but some people are more equal." This is a famous saying from the film "Animals' Farm". Till now, the condition this sentence described is still commonly seen around the world. Perhaps we can learn something from it.   The United States, the most advanced country in the world, also the so-called "most democratic place" [sn2,s-] At the beginning of its history, the founders had written clearly about the human rights: "Every [wd3,-3] people are born equal." These words have also inspired a lot of people to fight for their equal rights, like the American Revolution, the Civil War, the two world wars. Indeed the democracy has thus been pushed forward greatly. But on the other hand, we have to admit that even here some people are more equal [aj3,1-] than others. For example, the law stipulated that everyone could elect or be elected. But the fact is that only the millionaires or politicians supported by powerful financial groups can afford the amazingly high expense of election. Furthermore, even if you want to vote, the value of your property must reach [wd4,-2] certain standard. Once they're elected as the congressman [np3,4-] they can enjoy a lot of privileges immediately, such as having free dinners, free transportation, free accomondations [fm1,-] etc. They indulge in luxury and extravagance all day and all night. In contrast with this, a large number of poor people are on the edge of starvation. In addition, the blacks and the whites are not equal, either. Racial discrimination has always been a serious social problem. Although they have fought for over 200 years, their miserable fates haven't any change. They are forbidden to enter the door of great opportunities and therefore can only do the dirtiest, hardest job. Some day, I'm sure, the volcano of anger of these blacks, who have been kept at the bottom of the society, will explode.   In our country we can also meet a lot of such kind [np6,4-] of "more equal [aj3,1-] " people. Most of them hold high position [np6,2-1] in the government or state-owned companies. They take full use of their power to seek extra profits, like taking bribes, finding good jobs for their relatives, spending [vp2,-6] country's [np6,s-] money on travelling, eating, going abroad, etc. Now, our social legal system isn't strong enough. Sometimes some leader's words are the law. If the leaders' children break the law, they can easily escape the punishment freely. All these exert very bad influence among the public [pp1,2-]  From [wd4,1-2] above examples, we can clearly see that at every corner of our world the "more equal [aj3,1-] " people all exist. So it's necessary for us to change this unfair situation. First, I think, the central government should pay [vp2,-3] more attention on this matter and get those more equal [aj3,1-] ones out of the leadership. Secondly, the media and the public should supervise and expose the repulsive deeds of the officials as soon as possible. Thirdly, everyone should make good examples [np3,4-1] themselves.  (t10-9)   In his novel Animal Farm, George Orwell wrote "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others". As far as I see it, this statement is still perfectly true in the present world.   First of all, the unequality [fm2,-] derives from an imbalance in [wd4,1-3] distribution of wealth. In this world, there are both people as rich as billionairs [fm1,-] and people as poor as church mice. Consequently, they cannot enjoy equal rights both in material and in democracy. It is obvious to say that people are not equal in wealth. As for democracy, we can take the judicial system as an example to see how unequality [fm2,-] goes on in this aspect. If a rich person is accused of a certain crime, firstly he is able to afford the usually high bail and to wait for the trial outside prison. Then, an expensive but eloquent and competent attorney may help him to reduce [vp1,-5] the sentence several years shorter or even prove him innocent, though he does commit something guilty. However, a poor person may not be so lucky. His empty pocket may even put his life to an end as well. There is no need to mention how many rich people bribe or threaten witnesses, [sn9,s-] so far we can see that the rich and the poor are not equal.   Then, let us look at what happen between civilians and government officials. Once mankind has power to administer others, he will abuse it more or less without doubt. Corruption and accepting bribes are common practice throughout the world. Certainly there are impartial officials as well. But people under their control always like to regard [vp1,-6] them as more superior [aj3,1-] [aj2,-] than them and try every means to please them, expecting they can get favour [cc3,1-] from them one day. In term of this division of labour of [wd4,1-1] society, people are not equal either.   Next reflection of unequality [fm2,-] lies between different races, [sn9,s-] racial discrimination is mostly existing in white people dominating countries with a multi-race background. In these countries, though the human rights of its [pr3,4-] citizens of colour has been improved a lot through the ages, there is still a long way to go. Two years ago, a negro [fm3,-] was beaten to death by the policemen in Los Angeles. This violation had [vp6,d] aroused indignation and outcry of the public. However, this is only one of the most distinctive examples from numerous acts of racial discrimination in various ways. Many white people seem still to be unable to reject the idea of despising people of another colour totally because of traditional, cultural and economic reasons.   To put the foresaid three [wd1,4-1] aspects to a nutshell, though all the governments in the world alledge [fm1,-] their countries to a free, equal and franternal [fm1,-] one, many unequal phenomena cannot be totally got rid of after all. Though the slogan of "all men are equal" is prevailing for many year [np3,1-] there are still some people who are "more equal [aj3,1-] than the others", even if it is all too bad for us to admit it.  (t10-10)   People in each country of the world have struggle [vp9,1-] for freedom and equality for hundreds of years, and it is now nearly the end of the 20 century. What is the situation today? Have all the people got equality? Are all men are [wd6,s-] equal today?   If these questions were raised fifty years ago, you could easily find the answer from a newly-published novel named Animal Farm, written by a Russian writer. In the novel it said "All men are equal: but some are more equal than others." Actually, these words illustrated the human right situation in the Sovil [fm1,-] Union of the day, and also that of the world. Fifty years have passed now, and the world have [vp3,2-] changed a lot. Are these word [np3,1-] still be [wd5,s-] true? To me, I will say yes.   Here I am not denying that in each country of the world more and more people have got their equality, and great progress has been made in the equality of man. But it is still not enough. Still in every country, no matter socialism or capitalism, there are some people more equal [aj3,1-] than others. There are many causes for this phenomenent [fm2,-] Here I would like to mention three, which are common and tipical [fm1,-]   The first reason leads [vp4,s-] to the unequalness [fm1,-] is the unequal distribution of poverty [wd3,s-] The current distribution system is enlarging the gap between the rich and the poor. The rich is becoming richer, and the poor is becoming poorer. Although according to the law, the rich and the poor are all civilian [np3,s-] of a country, and have the same rights and [wd4,s-] legally equal. In real life, they are not equal at all. The richer a person is, the more equal [aj3,1-] he will be. This conclusion can be proved by a simply [wd2,1-1] example. A man is accused for [wd3,4-] shoplifting, [sn9,s-] if he is rich, he can engage the best lawyer or bribe the judge, and he may be free after paying some fine. But for a poor [wd4,2-1] who committed [vp6,s-] the same crime, he has no money to engage a lawyer or bribe the judge, so he has to be in prison for several years.   The second reason is that in [wd5,s-] nowadays there are two different stratum [np3,2-] in the society. One is formed by the group of people who have power in hand. In other words, it is formed by officials. The other stratum, of course, is formed by civilians. The more power one has, the more equal [aj3,1-] he will be. Power is a kind of commodity between the officials. A president of a company can give a good position to the son of a government official who is in charge of tax exchanging for lower taxes than other company [np6,s-] And a mayor can promise to a judge that he would help him become the chief if he gives his nephew who committed a crime a lenient punishment.   The last reason is the difference between different country [np6,1-] different culture [np6,1-] and different races. The last one is the main cause of the racial discrimination, which is becoming a great obstacle for mankind to reach the hill-top of the equality of man. Some races, which is [vp3,3-] less developed or had been [vp6,s-] in lower position in history, is [vp3,s-] now being discriminated and unequally treated. In a same nation, they cannot have the same right like other dominating races have.   To sum up, people are becoming more equal [aj3,1-] today, but we still have a long way to go. Various of [wd5,1-1] reasons have made us unable to achieved [vp4,1-] the target our forerunners had struggled for for ages today. So long as these problems such as the unequal distribution of poverty [wd3,s-] or the commodity of power [wd7,3-] between official [np6,1-] or the racial discrimination exist, the world will never be equal, and the saying "All men are equal, but some are more equal than other" will always be true.  (t10-11)   Have you ever seen the film "Animal Farm" adapted by Georgy [fm1,-] Orwell? It's a famous cartoon reflecting the political situation of the former Soviet Union during its communist revolution time in 1917. In this film, there is a famous saying which was [vp6,s-] stuck out by the black pig when he finally seized [vp6,s-] power. That is, "All men are equal, but some one [fm2,1-] are [vp3,2-] more equal than others!" And for all the cartoon's artistic exaggeration and fabrication, this sentence is true and still effective in today's world.   First, on a world-wide scale, some countries are indeed more equal [aj3,1-] than others! America, who [pr5,1-] boasts its indispensable role as a "world police", is at all times interferring [fm2,-] with others' internal affairs. Putting sanctions against those who refuse to obey his orders, or lifting embargos [fm2,-] on [wd3,2-] the countries finally giving up their positions, Uncle Sam is watching impatiently for his chance to put this world under control. However, it does not stop here. The United Nations, which is a comprehensive body formed with members of most nations in the world and supposed to deal with the international affairs just [wd2,5-] and fairly, is finally turned [vp7,s-] out to be a "magic word" played by the superpowers on a wide political stage. On the other hand, the third world, now struggling its way for a better life, is not only dragged by the backward economy and low-leveled education, but also bearing an overwhelming pressure created by some so-called international "peace-keeping troups [fm1,-] ". In this case, it's hard for the people of these countries to keep territorial integrity and maintain political independence, let along [vp2,s-] human rights and social democracy! They are simply the dreams far beyond average person's reach and only appear on the screen when the arragant [fm1,-] westerners use them as weapons to attack their opponents.   Second, on a nation-wide scale, it's been a common knowledge [np5,2-] for people to hear the talks of power-abusing, duty-corrupting or bribery-accepting by some high-level officials up to the nameless self-employed laborers [wd7,s-] Most of these people either occupy an important position in the government organization, or enjoy some reputation in the literary and art circles, or simply have a fairly large fortune in the bank. It's them who make up a "noble class" in contemporary China, and now are regarded as [wd4,s-] superior to those ordinary citizens in terms of ease and comfort. Compared with these "rich people", the teachers, intellectuals and workers are simply leading a "miserable" life which is carefully budgeted only to have both ends meet. However, despite their poor income and low social status, we must admit, [sn9,s-] they are the backbone of our nation and should be paid [vp1,-s-] more respect as well as rewardings [fm2,-] for their life-long devotions [np5,2-3] to this society!   Now, with the famous words "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others" echoing back in mind [sn3,s-] it could be figured out that this not only [ad1,s-] reflects the past, but also the present, and [sn9,s-] I hope, it won't fulfill a same future!  (t10-12)   Thousands of years had past [wd3,4-] till some brave and opimistic [fm1,-] British men announced publicly that "All men a [fm1,-] created equal" in 1689. Three hundred years have gone now since we dedicated to that proposition. We have got great progress, [sn9,s-] as we all know, that [wd5,s-] we almost demolished kings or queens and it is written down in most nations' constitutions that all men are equal. Can we boast of our feat and engage in the luxury of cooling off, thinking that we will get our final success soon? No! It is true that all men are equal now but it is more true [aj3,1-] that some are more equal [aj3,1-] than others. Man is far away from his most beautiful goal --- real and complete equality.   In this equal world, lots of people are still concerned on [aj2,3-] the colors [np5,s-] of them [pr1,s-] and racial discrimination still exist [vp3,3-] It is quite obviously [wd2,3-2] if you put your view on South Affrica [fm1,-] where black [np6,s-] still can not enjoy the same rights as white [np6,s-] Even in the United States, the freest and equalest [aj3,-] nation, black [np6,s-] dose [fm1,-] not match [vp2,3-3] to the white totally. Usually blacks get poorer education and living condition [np6,s-] Their social position are [vp3,3-] lower. They are still crippled by the chains of discrimination and suffered [vp6,s-] police brutality. While Martin Luther King died with his great dream thirty years ago in Losangel [fm1,-] a fierce racial conflict broke out for the same reason King worried about.   Apart from the racial unequality [fm1,-] man also face [vp3,2-] the problem of wealth. Fortunately, in this equal world some men are rich and some are poor. This difference is becoming more and more bigger [aj3,1-] So we have five stars hotel as well as the benches in the parks. So we have the comfortable country villa with the shabby cabin in the ghetto. So we have tender beefsteak and black bread. A rich [wd4,2-1] can pay a fine in stead [fm2,1-] of go [vp4,] to jail. A rich [wd4,2-1] can employ the best doctor and a rich [wd4,2-1] can even sometimes destroy a poor [wd4,2-3l] with his money, if he like [vp3,2-]   The third thing I want to mention is the equality between men and women. Nowadays, thanks to the Women Liberation Movement, women get lots of rights from their rivals, but women are in some ways still in a subordinate position like before [pp1,1-] They do the same work as men but be [vp9,s-] paid little. Their promotions are more difficult and rarer compared with the males. Wives must take their husbands' names and they usually do most of [wd4,2-1] housework no matter who earned [vp6,s-] bread. It is common to see husband [np6,-s-] enjoy [vp3,2-] reading [wd4,-2] evening newspaper while his wife is washing dishes. Furthermore, in lots of places, women [np3,s-] is just a subject of men. The only duty of her is to satified [fm1,-] her man's sexal [fm1,-] request and product [wd2,-1] children. In these places people sometimes will kill femal [fm1,-] baby [np6,2-] for their inclinations of boy [np6,1-]   It is said that "even a cat can face the king", [sn1,s-] but I am sure if this cat annoys the king [sn9,s-] he will easily has [vp9,3-] this cat's head cut down. In our equal world, there are some people decide to fight with the neighber [fm2,-] country [sn8,s-] and it is some others who have to pick up guns. So, accord [vp5,-2] to these, I must say that equality has not down [wd3,-] with all God's children. "All men are equal" is a dream for us to try to realise. We still have a long way to go before we can sing together happily "Equal at last, equal at last, thanks [np2,-2] God almighty [47plncprg] we are equal at last!"  (t10-13)   In Geroge [fm1,-] Orwell's novel "Animal Farm", he wrote "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others." I think this is still true today.   Let's not discuss the racial discrimination existing in some countries for the present. We just take a common social phenomenon as an example. It can be said as a world-wide phenomenon. So as a large country in the world, China face [vp3,s-] this question as well.   After a long-termed [fm2,-] hard struggle, Chinese people gained freedom and the equal right, especially in the recent years, with the implementation of the Open Policy and other enlighterned [fm1,-] policies, Chinese economy is raising at a stunning speed, and Chinese people have a stable life. But we have to admit that the people who are more equal [aj3,1-] than others are still existence [wd2,2-] These men can be divided into two kinds. One is the men who possess authority. Most of them hold an important post or a lucrative post. It is the authority [np1,-1] that they[pr5,-] look down upon the average person[cc1,1-], and think that they are the men of noble birth; [sn9,s-] It is the authority [np1,-1] that they [pr5,-] solve some sticky questions easily which common people treat as difficult ones; It is the authority [np1,-1] that they [pr5,-] always are accorded courteous reception wherever they go, and their relatives and friends also benefit from them. So, it appears that the average people are sweating in packed buses, while they are glacing [fm1,-] over streets through the dark brown window of their luxury cars; the average person [np3,s-] are lining up for tickets while they are dialling [fm1,-]gracefully; the average person [np3,s-] are rushing about simpal [fm1,-] things while they sign their names skilfully on brief informal note [np6,3-] All these privilege [np3,2-] separate them from the mass and make them more equal [aj3,1-] than others.   The other kind is the rich men. Though they haven't authority like the former one, as they have money, they can share the privilege as well. As they have money, they can solve sticky questions under the help of expensive gifts. As they have money, they can buy all kinds of special service and convienence [fm1-] In people's views, these rich men are also more equal [aj3,1-] than others.   Today's society is developing speedly [fm2,-] and at the same time, our country is trying it's [wd3,1-1] best to suit this development with perfecting it's [24cyzsbrc] rules and regulations. So during this period, though the unreasonable phenomenons [fm2,-]like these are still exist [vp9,s-] we believe that they will be eliminated one day, and we look forward to the coming of that day.  (t10-14)   In George Orwell's novel "Animal Farm", he wrote that "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others." Scores of years have passed since then, however, this still proves to be true today.   It is said that all men are born equal, regardless of their race, color, sex and nationality etc.. If this is true, there should be [wd4,d] slavery, segregation and sexual injustice. The reality is: some men, most from the dominent [fm1,-] class in the society, regard themselves as more equal [aj3,1-] men, as the privileged class. They do whatever they like, ignoring the law, ignoring the social conventions. Look at the status of American negro [fm3,-] Segregation will always exist as long as the whites still bear the thought in mind that they are the dominent [fm1,-] class, they are more equal [aj3,1-] than the negros [fm2,-] [fm3,-] In such a deteriorating society, you are judged not by the content of your character but simply by the color of your skin. A negro [fm3,-] does not have the equal rights in politics, economy and culture as a white man has. It is the law that has promised the equal rights for all races. It is also the law that sentences criminals of different races in a different way. A court may sentence a negro [fm3,-] to death for a sin for which a white man will only be sentenced to one or two years' imprisonment. Racial differences makes [vp3,2-] unequal rights. This is the case not only in the States, but in almost every country around the world.   Go back to China. Pick up a newspaper [wd4,s-] you will easily find a criminal case of corruption. It is known to all that lots of government officials, along with their families, lead luxurious and corrupt lives, becoming the privileged class in the society. They make full use of their powers to seek for their own interests. They do this by hook or by crook, even by committing crimes. They are not afraid of any punishment, for they have the so-called "relation web" which will protect them quite well. They seem to be more equal [aj3,1-] than the ordinary people. Not until these social moth [np3,2-] have been eliminated will our society has [vp9,s-] a bright future, will our people lead a happy life, enjoying the equal rights the law has promised them. Take a look at the joint-venture enterprises in Guangdong province [fm3,-], you will probably be shocked by the unfair treatment of millions of workers who have come to Guangdong to fulfil their dreams of success. They have contributed a lot to the rapid development of the economy. But what have they got? They haven't been guaranteed the basic rights of payment, safety and freedom. They are just treated as cheap labor [wd3,s-] [wd4,s-] even working machines. Eighty-one workers, most [wd4,1-] from northern provinces, lost their lives in the great fire which broke out a few days ago. How could this tragedy happen? Because there isn't any fire-fighting equipments [np5,-] in the factory at all. Because they have [vp6,s-] been locked in the workshop by their boss so [wd5,s-] what they could do was only to wait to die. Where are their rights of safety and freedom then? Who is to be blamed for this tragedy, their capitalist boss or our socialist law which has promised every citizen equal rights in labour? When and how will such unequality [fm2,-] in all aspects be completely wiped out?   It is true that all men are getting more and more equal [aj3,1-] with the development of the society and the expansion of democracy in our lives. But we have to admit that unequality [fm2,-] still exist [vp3,3-] almost everywhere. Surely it needs our great efforts to achieve human equality for all the people. But we will always cherish the hope of an equal society in our mind, we will always strive for this aim.  (t10-15)   In his novel "Animal Farm", George Orwell wrote "All men are equal, but some are more equal [aj3,1-] than others." These words were the writers [np4,1-1] irony to some of the leaders of the former Soviet Union. Those leaders promised people equality and democracy. But after they gained power, they became dictators. They had special authorities which others couldn't possess. Now, the U.S.S.R has collapsed. Russia has taken the place of it. But in today's Russia, the phenomenon of breaking promise [np6,s-] and dictatorship still exists.   Russia was set up as a democracy. At least, Russian President Boris Yeltsin claimed that Russia was a democracy. Before he was President of Russia, he had preached pluralism in politics. He criticized [vp1,-s-] the Communist Party monopolizing the politics. He said the Communist Party should tolerate different opinions and allow other party [np6,2-1] to take part in the election. His words represented people's wish. Therefore he was elected the President.   But after he became a President [fm3,1-] he didn't keep his promise. He behaved in contrast with[pp2,-2] his promise. About the method of reform, there were different opinions. Some people preferred a gradual reform. Some advocated a radical one. The Russian Parliament supported a gradual reform while the Russian President was in favour of a radical one. There was controversy between the Parliament and the president. According to the President's promise, since Russia was a "democracy", any major problem should be determined by [np6,s-1] people. In stead [fm2,1-] of holding a poll, the President dissolved the parliament. Without parliament, no one could control his power and oppose his policy. He became a real dictator. All people has [vp3,2-] [vp6,d] converged on him. The parliament didn't obey his order. Then, he sent troops to surround the parliament building. He threw the leader of the parliament into prison. Is this a civil rule? No. His power came from the barrel. Now, he has more power than others. He can do whatever he like [vp3,1-] without any opposition. He is more equal [aj3,1-] than others.   The president has advocated pluralism before. He said different idea should be allowed and opposition party should be allowed to take part in the election. But before the new parliament election, the president announced that his opponent, Ruslan Khasbulatov, whom he had thrown in prison, was not allowed to take part in the election. He cracked down on his opponent by military means. The president will have no opponent in the election. His party will certainly win. But all the significance of election will lose because people have only one choice. The president do [vp3,2-] not have a sense of equality and fairplay [fm1,-] He think [vp3,1-] he is more equal [aj3,1-] than his opponent.   The president don't [vp9,2-] think that he is equal to others. He defends his interest at the expense of other's rights. It is impossible for the officials in his government to regard themselves as ordinary citizens. The officials have the authority to deal with the possession of the country. They illegally sell some important material at the market to hit big [sn8,s]. This has led to the disorder in economy. The Russian economy has been declining. The unemployment rate is soaring and the living standard is falling. But some people become millionair [fm1,-] in this slack season, of whom 90% are officials. They become rich because they have more power; because they are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.   Therefore I think the phenomenon that some are more equal [aj3,1-] than others still exists in today's Russia. Russia is not a real democracy.  (t10-16)   I saw the Animal Farm from the video. Actually, this was an interesting story. The screenwriter made use of the animals to reflect the idea and emotion of the human being. "All animals are equal, no animals kill the other animals." This was one of the rules of the animal farm. But in fact, the animals did not obey this rule. Some animals were more equal [aj3,1-] than others. Finally, the good animals rose up and wiped out the bad animals. "I HAVE A DREAM" was an article which I just finished. This speech was made by Martin Luther King Jr. In his speech he expressed his strong hope that one day all black people and white people were equal in America. All that made me sad. I asked myself why the human being could not unite and live friendly.   I couldn't help thinking of the situation at present. Maybe I was born in 70's and have not experienced hardships. I am growing up in a happy environment. Although, [sn9,s-] I learnt many things about the old society from my parents [sn2,s-] Since the policy [wd4,2-2] opening to the outside world was introduced in 1979 and we achieved the comprehensive modernization of agriculture, industry, national defense and science and technology. Living standard was improved. People work very hard and earn their own money. Then they use their money to buy services and goods that they like. Some people even run their own business. Gradually, you will find you live in a competitive society. Everybody has rights to compete. The more money you earn, the more happiness you enjoy. So I think the idea of unequality [fm2,-] almost disappeared [vp6,s-] The important point is depending on your hard working [sn8,s]   But in a large factory [sn2,s-] The problem of [pp1,-s-] some workers are more equal [aj3,1-] than others still remains. My mother works in a plastics factory. My mother and some women make packing bag [np6,2-1] of goods in one of the workshops in the factory. They wire the bag on a piece-rate system. The more you wire, the more you got [vp6,s-] paid. The plastics materials are divided into two kinds. One they call is "soft piece", [wd4,-2] other is "hard piece". If they get the soft piece, it's more easy [aj3,1-] and quick [aj3,4-] for them to wire bag [np6,2-] In order to make more money, some women flatter the supervisor of the workshop. They often call on him, bringing a lot of gifts and try their best to please him. In return, they usually get soft piece and good marks in the monthly report. My mother disgusts [cc3,-2] this practice, so her pay is lower than others [sn4,s-1] and she felt [vp6,s-] unhappy with her work. She often blows off steam at home. My father persuades her to be a yesman. When I know that I also felt [vp6,s-] very angry. That's unfair and unequal. I suggest my mother [vp4,3-] report this bad phenomenon to the factory director, and get [vp4,s-] rid of this bad practice [wd7,s-]  I have dream [np6,1-1] now. I hope one day the millennium will arrive. All people can live equally.  (t10-17)   In his novel Animal Farm, George Orwell wrote "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others." Though this statement is seemingly ridiculous, it is sadly true.   All men are created equal, as the Bible says. And some countries have already put it into their constitutions because they regard equality as a most valuable thing. However, in reality, when all men are crying for equality, inequality has its firm position almost everywhere. It is not unusual in many countries that a small group of people enjoy higher social status along with more privileges, more freedom and more priorities at the expense of unequal treatment of others.   Nothing, I think, illustrates the inequality between people better than racial discrimination. In many developed countries which boast of being the most democratic countries, white people always take precedence over colour citizens, especially over black people. Only because of [wd4,1-2] different colours of their skin from the white, colour citizens have to take harder work and get lower pay. They have to live in special sections of the city and they have to accept their unsatisfactory living conditions. Their children can not receive education as high as they want, not because they are not clever enough, but because they have no [wd3,-2] enough money. Since their children can not receive proper education, they are not likely to get high-paid jobs and improve their living conditions. So a vicious cycle forms. Brazil, one of the original homes of black people, has gradually become a white country. It boasts of no racial segregation as it has no laws against black people. But the white are taking the lead of this country in its politics and economy. The black illiterates are twice as many as the white illiterates. And the black, the poorest people in Brazil, who account for 10% of the population, only possess no more than 1% of [wd4,-2] total wealth. From this, we can imagine what the life of the black is like in other countries which have stipulations against the black in explicit terms. Colour citizens are always in the second class of the society. They give more, but receive much less than they deserve. Although people have struggled for equality for quite a long time and have made some progress, racial discrimination and racial segregation are still a big social problem. When can the manacles and chains that have crippled colour people for so long be smashed? Only if colour people are set free, equality will have truely [fm2,-] come.   Inequality between men and women in this man-dominating society is also remarkable. Since the Women's Liberation of the 1960s, women's status and conditions has [vp3,4-] attracted increasing attention. Though women's conditions since then have been greatly improved, women are still far from being equal to men. You will find the following common: Women get less pay for the same amount of work; women are always sort of discriminated by others while working together with them; and it costs women a lot more to get the same position and so on. In a word, women have less opportunities to fulfill themselves. In rural areas of China, many girls are not allowed to receive higher education because their parents consider it useless for girls to receive any higher education. They think that being helpful in housework or even farmwork is much more valuable than studying any books. So many girls leave school after graduating from primary schools, or even before their graduation they have to quit.   Apart from the two forms mentioned, inquality [fm1,-] in this society has many other various forms. It mainly results from unequal distribution of wealth between people and results in unequal economic status, political status, social status, etc., which lead to further inequality. So, in order to fight against inequality efficiently, people from the lower classes must learn how to gain equal economic status first through every possible measurement. Then all other things will follow like a stream.   Being equal between all men is a sweet dream, in which "all men will be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness". Obviously there is still a long way to go, but I believe with everyone's efforts, this dream will come true someday, and by that time all men will be truely [fm1,-] equal.  (t10-18)   "That all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." The architects of the America wrote these magnificent words in the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence in 1776. Now, more than 200 years has passed. Has this wonderful dream of all Americans come true? Are all American people equal? When asked to answer this question, I would have nothing to say but "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others."   It is true that the law of America has recognized that all citizens of America are equal and they all have the same rights, despite of different beliefs, religions, races, educations [np5,-]... But it is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note so far as most of the citizens of the country are concerned.   Politically, it is clearly stated in [wd4,1-2] American Law that citizens have this or that kind of right, including the right to run for the presidency. It seems that people in that country are equal to one another and it is really very fascinating to a lot of people. However, this is only the specious writing and the superficial phenomenon. In fact, there are many restrictions to these rights when people are to exercise these rights. Although the law states that all men are equal to have these rights, no chances are provided for most of the people. For example, the law says that everyone has the equal right to be elected. However, it will cost one several million US dollars to run for the congressman and even more for the presidency. However, there are very few people who have so much money to cover the cost. We all know that none of the last candidates who run for the presidency in America are not millionaire [np3,s-] or billionaire [np3,s-] So the "equal" rights to vote and the "equal" rights to be elected are actually seperated [fm1,-] and the right to be voted is only a "patented article" of the millionaires, or the billionaires. So, to be a president of America is only a wonderful dream of the common citizens of America and it will never be possible for the common citizens to be a president, no matter how equal they are. So I have to say "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others."   Moreover, some white men are more equal [aj3,1-] than some black men. White men are still having better education, are living in better houses, and are occupying higher positions. However, the black men are still languishing in the corners of American society and find themselves exiles in their own land. Although the black men have struggled for a long time for equal rights, the local authorities still reflect the popular prejudices against the black; there are many cases of injustice. The riot in Los Angels broke out a few years ago just because of the police brutality against the black. In fact, the black men are still the victims of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality.   So, what we can say is still "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others."  (t10-19)   I think today it is still true to say "All men are equal: but some are more equal than others."   The famous saying was first written by George Orwell in his novel "Animal Farm". The novel tells a story of an animal kingdom. At first all the animals lived and worked together equally. One day they rose up and drove their master away. Then things changed. Since a pig was elected as the leader of the kingdom, all the pigs realized that they were in a privileged position. So they began to work much less than other animals or even stop working at all, and enjoy the best food produced by others. Though other animals felt angry at the inequality, they dared not speak out, because the pigs raised a lot of fierce dogs to punished [vp5,1-] those who dared to defy their authority.   It's only a tale, but you can find [wd4,1-2] reflection of the huamn [fm1,-] society.   We know that all men are created equal. But most of the time we can see some people who are more equal [aj3,1-] than others. Even in the United States, a country always shows great concern about human rights in other countries, the situation is not so satisfying. Most of its black people are living in ghettos. Their children cannot receive good education, and the adults cannot find good jobs. If they do wrong, they would get more serious punishment than those white men. Racial discrimination has prevented them from enjoying the prosperity which the white people are enjoying. But little can be done to change it in a very short time. The white men don't want to give the black men the same amount of wealth and opportunity, for fear that they would lose a lot, or even their dominion. Only when people learn the exact meaning of "All men are equal", and keep it in heart, can the black men enjoy the same rights as the white.   It's obvious that those who have got some power can be more equal [aj3,1-] than other common ones. They would set up rules for others to obey, but they themselves needn't obey it [pr3,s-] thoroughly. So they become members of the group who are more equal [aj3,1-] than others. We can find examples for this very easily. The following is one. Each year there are many students who would sit for the College Entrance Exam. It is said that only those high-level students can win the competition and enter colleges. But in fact, we can see that many students of lower marks can enter a better college and choose a better speciality to study. People can do nothing to stop it but complain. They just think it very natural for those with power to make use of their power, they would make full "use" of the power as well.   It's almost a truth that men are selfish animals. And it seems impossible for all the men to overcome it. So the fact that there are always some people who are more equal [aj3,1-] than others still exists today, and will last for a long long time.  (t10-20)   In his novel, Animal Farm, George Orwell wrote "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others". At that time, it was considered as a reflection of the situation in the Soviet Union. Dozens of years has now passed since it was written in 1930s, [sn9,s-] from my point of view, it is still true today, although the world has changed a lot.   In every country all over the world, you can easily perceive that the case still remains true. But let's be specific by taking American society as an example.   In the American Constitution it was declared officially that all men are created eqaul [fm1,-] But in effect, it was not the case. As a result, unequality [fm2,-] together with other factors begat [fm1,-] the American Civil War. Though after the war Negroes were set free, it was nominal. Negroes are still contempted [wd2,s-] and are not as equal as the whites. Still remember the accident in which the victim, a black person [sn9,s-] broke the traffic law, [wd4,s-] took place in Los Angeles two years ago? I was surprised to hear that instead of being punished in the legal way, he got brutal beating by two white policemen as his punishment. More unexpectedly, after the controversial trial, the two white policemen were declared inguilty [fm2,-] Though the case is on trial again under the public pressure and the result is still unknown, we can come to a conclusion from what we have learned so far that in America, the country which calls itself the most equal society in the world, there still exist some people who are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.   Let's look at the American society once more. The constitution says every citizen has the right to vote as well as the right to stand for election. The reality is another story. In America, when you have a desire to run for Senator [wd3,s-] President [wd3,s-] or whatever it is, it is quite impossible for you to get the upper hand over your opponents if you have no strong backup. Closer to the point, you will lose in whatever election it is without sufficient money support. At [wd3,-2] such circumstance [np6,2-] you cannot afford the expensive fee of the publicity which will certainly help to make you familiar to the public and as a result will do good to your victory. Since not all American citizens are billionaires or millionaire [np3,s-] those who are not, I must say most of them are not, will by all means not hold their own with those who are. Thus, in a sense, most of the American citizens have no right to be elected at all. In another word, the rich are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.   So, in a nutshell, the case which George Orwell described sixty years ago remains true.  (t10-21)   The Declaration of the [wd5,3-1] Independence says: All men are created equal. Equality, which men have been persued [fm1,-] struggled for and dreamed of for thousands of years, is still our dreams. Some people are more equal [aj3,1-] than the others among our equally-born creatures.   It is not surprising, [sn9,s-] [wd4,s-] in China especially in the countryside, men account for most of the people who ask for divorce in the court. A woman will be in a great trouble if she puts forward a claim for breaking up her marriage. She will be thought to be adultering [fm2,-] or degenerated. The rumors and slanders will engulf her. But it is quite natural for a man to submit a case for divorcing his wife. In a family, the wife is dominated by her husband, who boasts superior authority. I once heard that a woman had been beaten to death by her cruel husband, who, later, received no punishment at all. In a Chinese family, the men seem to be more equal [aj3,1-] than the women.   In China, power is superior to all the other things. Now, in market economy, most men are devoted to earning as much money as possible. Apparently the wealth opens its door of opportunity to all the children of the God. For a learned man, it is very easy to get a decent and highly-paid job from a sensible boss, who is heading for high profits as his business is concerned. Those who received little education and have little capacity will be refused to be accepted for a very important position. But actually in most cases, things are quite different. If you have a very good friend or a relative or a brother or father, who is in a very important position in our government or in a company, you don't have to waste your time and energy worrying about your job or your future. When your friend or relative entered [vp6,d] his job [cc3,2-] your work was arranged [vp6,s-] at the same time.   I come from the countryside and I can understand why so many peasants dream of being a cityman [fm2,-] Not only [cj1,s-] because in the countryside they work very hard just for living a hand-to-mouth life also because many rights have been derived [wd3,s-] as citizenship is concerned, [sn9,s-] [sn2,s-] Children in the city and in the countryside are born unequal. In the city, before you go to school, you can receive pre-school education and utmost care from the nursey [fm1,-] or kindergarten. While in the countryside, you'll be refused to be accepted by school until you are at the age of 7. All you can do is to stay with your parents who have little education and don't know how to teach you. The right to vote and stand for [cc3,1-1] election is the holy right granted by God. Every citizen has the right to vote according to our constitution. But my parents never vote or have the right to stand for election. The most ridiculous is that even my father, as a teacher, seldom vote [vp3,s-] The people in the countryside never enjoy the pleasure for [wd3,3-1] voting.   We still have a lot to do to improve our democrat [fm1,-] We have to open the door opportunity [wd7,s-] to all the people.  (t10-22)   In his famous novel "Animal Farm", George Orwell wrote: "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others." At the time, his intension was to satirize the authorities of the USSR of 30's. Sixty years have passed now. How ture [fm1,-] is this quotation today?   In 1863, at Gettysburg, Lincoln said: "...all men are created equal.." One hundred years later, at the same place, another great man, Martin Luther King said it again to the American people. What does equality really mean? In my opinion, the first meaning of equality is that everybody in this world should have a right to survive if he does not violate the law (such as murder or some other crimes). On this point, I must say that, today, some people are still more equal [aj3,1-] than others. In those developed countries. [sn2,s-] Some rich people spend thousands of dollars on a common dinner, which generally happens in their lives. At the same time, at eastern Africa, thousands of children are suffering from starvation. They are living at the verge of death. Comparing these two kinds of situation, I have to say that Orwell's quotation is still true today. Secondly, equality means that everybody has the same right to receive education, to have a joy, to get married... Considering this, let's look at China. In recent years, some public schools (private-owned [fm2,-] ) have been set up in some biggest cities. It is said that all students graduate [vp4,s-] from these schools will become talents. In order to go to these schools a student must pay a fairly large amount of money that is equal in the gross payment a worker gets in several years. Yet, in some remote areas, students study in such poor conditions that it is beyond your imagination: No chair, no desk, no blackboard, even no classroom [np6,s-] ! They sit on some flat stones and also study on it [pr3,s-] Some children can not go to such "school" just because they can not afford to buy a text book. It is the money, I should say, that makes some people more equal [aj3,1-] than others.   Thirdly, equality means that all people ( men or women, black or white), all races, all countries are equal. Some dozen years ago, a movement for women liberation broke out. Today, this movement is still going on. Women have more difficulties in getting jobs. Women workers receive less payment than their man [np3,1-1] colleagues. One hundred years ago. [sn2,s-] Lincoln announced that all men are created equal. Today, racial segregation and discrimination still exist in South Africa, the U.S. etc. Today, a race might be totally destroyed just because some people disgust [cc2,1-1] it, and a nation might be invaded because it disobeys the will of some powerful countries. I am not telling joys [wd3,4-] We should remember that these things happened several score years ago.   Although taking these in mind, I would not say that "the world is no equal", because we are making great effort to make things better. I would rather say that "the world will be equal". Time will proof [wd2,1-] everything, of course.  (t10-23)   In his novel "Animal Farm", George Orwell compared the dictatorship in the former Soviet Union as [wd3,8-] a farm where the black pig is [vp6,s-] the dictator. But ironic enough, this malaise seems to be more epidemic in the United States, the so-called most democratic country.   When the United States was founded, the nation's great architects wrote in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution that "We hold the truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal". The White or Black, the Jews or Protestant, are given the same rights as the citizens of the nation. But hundreds of years have passed, the poor, especially the black, must face the tragic fact that the unequality [fm2,-] still exists, and that they still remain on the bottom of the American society, exploited and suppressed by those who are standing proudly above them and walking all over them.   Standing on top of the pyramid are the tycoons, politicians of the state, with abundant money and great power in their hands, brandishing their baton to preside over the political and economic life of the nation. Their position is so far beyond the blue-collar and the white-collar that even the legetimate [fm1,-] power can have little effect on them, they have cleverly stationed themselves beyond the reach of the law, and into the refuge of money. The laws, which are worked out to decipline [fm1,-] people's conduct and behaviour, is [vp3,s-] hardly anything in their eyes. When there is [wd4,2-2] lawsuit against them, they generously open their purse and offer sufficient sum of money to win the justice to their side. They are a special class, a class that seldom suffer [vp3,4-] from punishment because of the wrong thing they have done, a class that without sweat, toil and tear, can make their purse swollen day by day, a class that merely by pressing the keyboard of the computer, telephoning, coaxing and persuading, obtain [vp3,s-] respectable status and make [vp3,s-] themselves indispensable to the society.   When they elegantly stand on the political platform, preaching their political points of view and trying to inculcate into people's mind that they are the representatives of the public, a common member [np3,s-] of the society, few people would like to doubt their sincerity. But the slogans they call out, the pledges they make and the dreams they promise to realize are tricks to keep them in their present veteran position, so that their privileges can be guaranteed, and they may enjoy much more equality than many others. They may easily accomplish many things which may seem incredible to the working-class. They win the listeners' applause by saying "All of God's children are born equal", but they gulp the latter part of the sentence, "though some are more equal [aj3,1-] than others."  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH SJD> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (t10-1)  	Liberty, Fraternity, and Equality is [vp3,4-] much advocated in the western world. Here apart from 'Liberty' and 'Fraternity', I'd like to have a word about 'equality', [sn9,s-] the Declaration of Independence of America began with the remark, "All men and women are created equal..." Equality is highly valued in that society. They think in their society, everyone has the equal chance to gain success by hard work. Abraham Lincoln, who became the president of America from a child of poor family, is the very example of this kind. [sn8,s]But we also have to admit the fact that American has only one Abraham Lincoln and similar examples are very rare, too.  	In fact inequality can be found everywhere. Even in [wd5,s-] nowadays black people are thought to be inferior to white people when applying for a job, [sn9,s-] a white people has more chance than a black, and before the 1960s, black [np3,-1] are [vp6,s-] descriminated [fm1,-] even more seriously. In a bus a black must give his seat to a white, [sn1,s-s-] black people was [vp3,2-] looked down upon everywhere. In 1960s, black people felt so unberable [fm1,-] they held a movement seaking [fm1,-] for equality with white people. That was about two hundred years after the publicaion [fm1,-] of the declaration [fm3,s-] of independence [fm3,s-]  	The position of men and women is another proof of inequality. This is almost a worldwide problem. Traditionally, women are always considered inferior to men. Women are expected to be staying at home and do housework while men do importment [fm1,-] work in the society. In a government high rank officials are mostly men, and if a women [np3,1-] wants to gain success in society she must sacrifice a lot more than a man does. If a man comittes [fm1,-] a mistake, he can be easily forgiven by others. While if [wd5,s-] a women [np3,1-] comits [fm1,-] the same mistake she will be more severely criticised by others, be considered really incompetent compared with a man. Her female sex becomes a target of attack. Also in 1960s the movement for women's liberation reached its climax in American and other European countries. They demanded equality with men in society.  	In the society, rich people and poor people are also unequal. In western countries classes are devided [fm1,-] by the property a person owns. A rich person is always respected and have [vp3,s-] more previlige [fm1,-] than a poor person. Rich children have more chances of receiving better education than poor children have.  	In short, although 'All men and women are created equal' has been advocated for hundreds of years, in a sense it's still a slogan. So in his novel American Farm, George Orwell wrote "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others." That is to say, in equality [fm2,s-] still exists in our society.  (t10-2)  	In his novel Animal Farm, George Orwell wrote, "All men are equal: but some are more equal than others." We can interpret it in a simple way, "All men are not equal." Even today, this is still true, which can be realized in [wd3,d] the different role of man and woman.  	It is true that today women are better educated and have higher expectations. They have far greater freedom of choice about their lives --- great number [np6,-2] [wd4,1-] choose to cohabit outside marriage and a range of work opportunities outside the home has opened up for them; it is common for mothers to leave young --- even very young children in the care of others while they work from choice rather than necessity [wd7,s-] but most women of working age are economically active as well as looking after a family [sn6,s-][sn8,s] 	Thus the general picture is that most married women of working age fulfil at least two roles simultaneously --- that of housewife [np6,2-] [np4,1-] and that of paid worker [np6,3-] [np4,1-] [sn9,s-] many are also mothers, especially at ages 25-44.  	But because of the physical differences between men and women, the types of occupation [np6,s-] for women are limited. There are women who are doctors, lawers [fm2,-] officials, but the number is small. The common occupations for women are secretary [cc1,s-] assistant [cc1,s-] in shops or banks, upbringing of pre-school children, care of the sick and elderly [sn9,s-] disabled, etc. Besides this, the wife's working life is often disrupted due to child-bearing, child-rearing, house keeping and perhaps the subordination of the wife's career prospects to those of her husband. When the two roles --- raising a family and doing economically productive work [sn9,s-] cannot go hand in hand, most women choose to carry only one [cc3,s-] namely, the family function, which is the effect of strong conventional influence.  	From the traditional point of view, a woman's place is in the home. A good wife does not have to be told what her husband and children think or need. It is her job to know them better than they know themselves. So if there is a conflict between the roles, most women give up the latter one --- doing economically productive work.  	Culture finds reflection in the language the people employ, because they value certain things and do them in a certain way, they come to use their language in ways that reflect what they value and what they do. This can be proved by the existence of [wd4,1-2] sexist language.  	In English, "man" is used as a term to describe the human race, even Orwell did stick to this rule, and 'he' is used as the unmarked (i.e. general) third-person singular pronoun.  	Because of the existence of the so-called sexist language, feminist leaders are trying to change the terms and creating new terms. Whether women can gain [wd4,1-2] equal right with men after the elimination of all the sexist language after women gain [wd4,1-2] equal right with men [wd5,s-] remains a puzzling question.  (t10-3)  In his novel Animal Farm, George Orwell wrote "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others." It is to a great extent not true today.  First of all, men are unlikely to be equal in each society, as there unavoidably exist some differences among sex, people's blood relationship and genetic factors.[sn1,s] Firstly, as we know, the Bible tells us that at the beginning of human history, one man (called Adam) and one woman (called Eve) were created by God, with the man in charge of hunting, farming, and the woman sewing and bearing children. From then on, men and women are socially different in that society lays down different social roles for them and expects different behavior patterns from them. On the whole, man can get more opportunities to develop themselves while women can get quite a few. Secondly, some people are fortunate enough to be born in those families which are rich or have high socialstatus. As a result of this, these people are more likely to get better education, develop much more kinds of hobbies and have much better jobs. Nevertheless, some people are unluckily born in poor and humble families. Their parents may not have enough food to feed them, how can they get chances to go to school? Furthermore, how can they find good jobs after being adults without receiving education? Thirdly, it is well known that in each society, there are always some outstanding people who can do many things much better than ordinary ones, and there are also some idiots who can hardly do anything well. According to genetics those children whose parents are clever are likely to be more clever [aj3,1-] than those whose parents are not. Therefore, I should say that men are not equal even before they come to the world [wd7,s-]  These unequalities [fm2,-] among men may result in the phenomenon that some men are more equal [aj3,1-] than others. That is to say, some men are more capable than others. That is why some pupils can become college students, some workers can become factory directors, and some people can become famous film stars or popular song stars while others can not. Of course, it is largely due to people's different abilities, but their different abilities are greatly the result of unequalities [fm2,-] among them at [wd5,-6] both before and after their birth.  (t10-4)  All men are created to be equal no matter what sex they belong to. They have the right to be born, to live and to vote. They have equal chance to recieve [fm1,-] education and to find a job as they want. However, some men are more equal [aj3,1-] than others even in [wd5,1-1] nowadays.  China has a long history of feudalism. The feudal partriarchal [fm1,-] clan system is the pillar of the system. So oppression and discrimination of women are one of the key points in Chinese feudalism. The feudal idea of regarding men as being superior to women exists everywhere. For example, on the one hand, parents especially in the countryside [sn9,s-] show much more favour towards boys in the family, as they think that boys are the roots of the family and married women are like water poured from a basin that you cannot take back. If a woman's elder brother has been married, she will be the person who always gets blamed by her sister-in-law. On the other hand, married women are always treated as the absolute property of their husbands. What women are required to do is to take good care of their husbands, children, mother-in-law and father- in-law. They are bound by domestic chores, have no opportunity to go to school and get jobs outside the home. An old Chinese saying reflects that --- (nu zi wu cai bian shi de). That means the less education a woman has, the better or if [cj1,s-] a woman with no education, she will be the best.  The reason for saying that women have low, even humble, social status is that the level of being educated is low and their own psychological qualities are not good --- they themselves have the concept of inferiority, and they tend to be jealous of other people's achievements. They are willing to be obedient 'servants'.  But today with the development of the society and improvement of civilization great changes have taken place in China. The role of women is quite different from that in the past especially in 1980's. Many of the women do not feel fullfilled [fm1,-] solely by household and family duties. Chinese men seem to do more than they used to of the household duties such as cleaning, cooking, shopping and caring for children though people the world over still regard household duties as basically women's tasks and women's responsibitities [fm1,-].[sn8,s] People usually think that women are good at being typists, sales assistants, textile workers, nurses and so on, but women have gone into all walks of the society. There have been women among scientists, pilots and mayors though they are only tokens. Certainly it is still true that men are given obvious preference in education, job selection and promotion. After the liberation of China women can obtain almost equal pay as men. To our delight in some units (factories, schools) women have extra subsidies for health.  What I talk about above is only one aspect of inequality. Indeed some are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.  (t10-5)  "Human beings are born to be equal", this is a concept firmly held by those advocates of science and democracy. Especially in our modern world, it has seemed to be a universalized truth. However, this is only an ideal concept. To be more truthful, something has to be added to fulfill the description of human equality --- "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others." Thank Mr. Orwell for his witty words, even today, this is undeniably true.  In fact, the moment children are born into this world, various kinds of unequalness will begin. Different children are not equal either physically or socially, or even both. Physically, an infant may be born to be very pretty and healthy, while another one may be ugly or unhealthy. More unfortunately, some babies lost [vp6,s-] their chances to live before or just after they face the world. So, can we say "All men are equal?" Is there anything of "equality" shown for those babies. [sn9,s-] 	Socially speaking, some babies are born into a pleasant living circumstance while others are not. Because of their parents' high social status, favorable economic conditions and fine family background, those lucky children indeed show their priority and superiority everywhere. Not only would the surrounding people look down upon them, but also [cj1,s-] the children from unfavorable families themselves would feel humble appearing in the world. Either they will be depressed, or [cj1,s-] they will make every effort going [vp4,3-] upper [wd2,1-3] to break the "unequalness." Then they will forget all their past and look down upon others as well.  Those who adovacate "All men are equal" indeed are the representatives of "unequalness". Because, after all, there are always people who are only seeking for daily foods and they have no time and effort to think about any abstract idea or concepts.  Just like the "universality of contradiction", unequalness exists everywhere. There is no ideal equality. This is the basic rule of nature.  (t10-6)  	All men are equal. It sounds alluring. But in fact it is only an impossible dream. What does "equal" mean? It is an obscure concept lying in people's mind. However, nobody can define it in the strict sense. Take human life into consideration, there may be two essential aspects concerning equality --- economic equality and political equality. In either aspects [np6,2-] it is true that "some are more equal than others".  	Economic unequality [fm2,-] is universal all over the world. It is reported that there were about 44,000,000 refugees in 1993. Compared with the number in 1973, it has been increased by 35 times. Those refugees had to move from one place to another without food and shelter. Among them children are the poorest victims. We can often see malnurtured [fm2,-] African children in magazines. On the other hand, We can also see how luxurious an Arabian princess' life is in other magazines. The gap is so great that nobody can still persist in saying that all the men are equal. Perhaps it is an extreme contrast. Let us see what is happening in our country; if not so acute, it is significant to a great extent. In big cities spoiled children are seen here and there. They eat imported food; they play with imported toy; they live in a comfortable enviorment [fm1,-] But in some remote areas, esp. in some inland villages, children cannot go to school because their parents cannot support them. How can we say all men are equal when we see and hear these facts?  	Political unequality [fm2,-] is also universal and severe. In English we have two phrases --- small potato and VIP, which is an evidence that some are more equal [aj3,1-] than others. The unequality [fm2,-] takes place not only among individuals, but also among nations, races and even between sexes. In the united nation [fm3,s-] some nations are more influential than others. In the United States, from [wd4,1-3] human rights movement in 1960s to the Los Angeles Incident in 1992, blacks have been struggling [vp6,s-] for equal rights for three decades. Yet almost nothing has changed. The unequality [fm2,-] between men and women has a longer history. In the Bible it is prescribed that women is [vp3,1-] inferior to men. Shakespear [fm1,-] also wrote in his masterpiece, "Woman, thy name is weak." Thus we can see how such a viewpoint is commonly accepted.  	Time goes on. Yet no changes have ever taken place. The situation is always the same, either what George Orwell described 50 years ago, or what happened 500 years ago as Shakespear [fm1,-] wrote. The world is like an animal fair. Martin Luther King's dream is still a broken dream.  (t10-7)  	In his novel "Animal Farm", George Orwell wrote "All men are equal: but some are more equal than others". In the "Delaration of Independence", the forerunners of the United States also proclaimed that "All men are created equal". In the sense that all men have to eat, drink, breathe, and die, all men are equal. No men can be any exception to these basic natural laws. However, in terms of sex roles and social success, all men cannot be equal. At least, this is the case today.  	First of all, men and women can't be equal. There is still bias agaisnt women in many respects. Women are traditionally regarded as "weak sex", both physically and intelligently. Therefore, there is a strong belief that women can only assume the role of a housewife, keeping the house, taking care of children and husbands, cooking and washing, as opposed to men's traditional role as a bread winner. Even in China, whose government stresses once and again that "women hold up half of the sky, and there should be no prejudice against women", many female graduates are rejected by some factories and companies just because they are females. [wd4,-2] Recent years, with the development of Women's Liberation Movement, more and more women are beginning to hold important roles, such as manger [fm1,-] [cc1,4-] doctor [cc1,5-] professor [cc1,6-] etc. In spite of this, the percentage for women in high position is still much lower than that for men. It seems that the way to complete equality between sex [np6,1-] is by no means short.  	Secondly, even among [wd3,1-3] the same sexes [np3,2-] say, males, there still can't be complete equality. On the one hand, all the males can't have [wd4,1-2] equal opportunity for education and employment. In many rural areas of China, many persons can't go to school for education not because they are intelligently unqualified, but because they can't afford the tuition. It goes without saying that without [wd4,-2] equal opportunity for education [wd4,s-] will necessarily result in unequality [fm2,-] in employment. On the other hand, even all the persons have the equal chance for education, they still can't achieve equal social success because not all the persons have the same capability and personality. Those who are talented, industrious and strongminded [fm2,-] will certainly be more successful than those who are not. In those countries where one's social background plays an important role in one's success, this matter will become more complex.  	In conclusion, it's not true that all men are equal today. Although it's uncessary [fm1,-] and impossible to make everyone achieve equal success, we should try to create equal opportunity [np6,3-] for everyone to success [wd2,4-]  (t10-8)  The sentence "All men are equal: but some are more equal than others" in George Orwell's novel Animal Farm gives me deep thought. Connecting this sentence with the reality now, I find it is still true. Nowadays in the world, some men are still more equal [aj3,1-] than others. Many aspects can reflect this. In this essay, I demonstrate 3 aspects to prove it.  Firstly, in social status. Social status came into being because of the development of history. People have different kinds of work, so, they have different social status. In fact, social status can't reflect the equality between men. But, as time going, some in superior positions look down upon those in subordinate positions. Some people show their respects for people in higher positions. Some people, such as, [sn9,s-] farmers, sanitation workers, etc are sometimes regarded as subordinates and looked down upon. This is a kind of social phenomena. From this angle, some people are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.  Secondly, in education. In some countries, for example, in the United States, black people can't have the equal chances to enter some good colleges and universities. In fact, every person should have the equal educational right no matter where he/she comes from or what nationality he/she is. This is another aspect.  Lastly, in the application for jobs. There are men and women in the world. Men and women should have the equal chances to apply for jobs. But, in reality, it is easier for men to apply for jobs. And those catering jobs are for women. In some countries, women are even not allowed to work outside. Women are regarded as to serve [pp1,2-2] their husbands at home. This is really unequal for women, and should be changed quickly.  On the whole, there are many aspects which can reflect the truth of this sentence. And, what we need to do is to try our best to make all men equal --- true [cc4,-1] equal.  (t10-9)  	In his novel Animal Farm, Georage [fm1,-]Orwell wrote: "All men are equal; but some are more equal than others." Perhaps, at that time it is [vp6,s-] true. All men are created by the [wd5,-1] God. From this view, they are equal. Some are born weathy [fm1,-] some are born poor. In his opinion, the rich are more equal than the poor. Today, such a phenomenon still exists. Some people are very rich while some people have to beg for [wd4,1-1] living. Some people have enormous social background [wd7,s-] Whenever and wherever they want something done, they can get it done quickly. In the meantime, many people often get into trouble, live a miserable life and don't know what to do. In [wd4,1-1] society today, generally speaking, not many people inherit the property. Even if they possess large quantity of property, it doesn't mean they can have it forever. They also have to work hard or one day they will possess nothing. Can diligence and laziness explain such a phenomenon? Sometimes, people working hard still can't change the situation. In my opinion, not only hard work but also opportunities determine a person's fate, but opportunities one can get are mostly accidental, not fatal. So, unfairness is unavoidable. I don't agree with George Orwell on this point. All men are equal. Under the conditions that people abide by rules made by the government, they are free, they can do what they want to do to achieve their goals. Although things are often unfair, on the way to success, they are equal.  	The most important factor influencing one's success is diligence. No matter what he does, he should put his heart in it and try hard until he succeeds. Only when he sees no hope can he give up. This is also related to another factor which has great effect on one's success. He must be persistent and can't have the intention of accidental victory. If he thinks that people who are consistently diligent can't achieve anything and yields, he will never succeed. Although persistence and diligence don't always lead to achievements, a person who succeeds is always persistent and diligent. Last, but not the least important, if a person wants to be successful in life, he must be able to make, find and get opportunities. Diligence and persistence are subjective while opportunities have little subjectivity. People trying hard to make and find opportunities get nothing in the end. Sometimes, people suddenly get opportunities. If they seize the opportunities and expose their full abilities, they can make great achievements in a short time. When it seems that a person has no opportunities at all, he'd better make and go to find opportunities by himself. It's no use to sit there, waiting and complaining [vp1,-3] his bad luck. Though he may face the failure, there is also possibility some good may come of it [wd7,s]  	All men are equal. Some fail, some succeed. There are only two reasons which can explain one's failure. First, he is lazy and give [vp3,4-] up any hope soon. Second, [sn2,s-] has no opportunities and doesn't make any efforts to find opportunities. Money is not equal to success. A person who owns a large sum of money is not really successful in life. It doesn't mean that he is more equal [aj3,1-] than others. It's just unfair.  (t10-10)  In his novel Animal Farm, George Orwell wrote, "all men are equal, but some are more equal then others." This is a satire upon the unfair treatment towards people of different social status from the sociaty [fm1,-]in his days. All men are created equal; none of the human race comes to the world bringing more property and power than others do. However, at the time, some people were entitled [wd3,-] the moment they were born what they might never obtain by themselves, while others came to the world "naturally", that is, with absolutely nothing, and had to struggle for what they deserved as human beings such as food and shelter. Men were actually not equal with each other in the sociaty [fm1,-] with the minority inheritedly [fm1,-] superior to the majority. Today, the sociaty [fm1,-] has undergone numeral [wd3,1-1] developments, and the unequalness [fm2,-]among members of the sociaty [fm1,-] has been paid much attention to. Most of the people who are enquired [vp1,s-] will state that men are now considered to be all equal, but in my poit [fm1,-] of view, what George orwell [fm3,s-] said is still true at [wd4,1-2] present time.  Obviously, the distinction between nobles and commons in feudal times has become history already, but there do exist the concepts of superiority and inferiority in people's mind. The distinction does not exist any longer, but it has had a very important influence upon sociaty [fm1,-] and man. Factors which were once the features of the superior social class are now the signs of being superior, although there isn't any superior class any longer, and the persons themselves can in no way be identified as members of it. Anyone who is closely related to these factors will be generally more respected than others, and the respect encourages him to remain what he is in order to feel respected, to feel superior to others. The persuit [fm1,-] of these factors indicates gradual emergance [fm2,-] [wd3,s-] into the higher group in the sociaty [fm1,-] The influence of the concepts is deep-rooted --- after all, the duration of the feudal sociaty [fm1,-] is quite long --- and is now almost impossible to remove. Man has never rejected the concepts, hence there has never been a time when all men are virtually equal.  Apart from the historical factor, developments of the human society here also played an important role. There are developed and developing areas in the world; those from the developed countries will enjoy preference in the developing countries, whereas those from developing countries will encounter prejudice in developed areas. This is also the case within one same nation. Another example is the prejudice cast upon the black people by the white. No matter one is black or white, he is born as [wd4,s-] natural man with inherent features, that is, the race is by itself natural instead of social. Black people are considered as of lower origins, because their ancesters [fm2,-] are [vp6,s-] from poorer areas, and had for many years been treated [vp6,s-] only as physical labourers. One can see that it is not fair at all, but, again, the fact is that it is impossible to get rid of the existing concepts.  	In a word, men are still not equal, although some have tried to alter the situation; that is the way it is.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH BW> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1>  (t10-1)  	Equality, [wd4,s-] the present human beings are born with, seems a little far-fetched for most women in China. For a large number of women, their success could be judged by the husband they marry. A charming Prince still stays in their mind as their ultimate aim. If not happily married, they would replace their marriage with their children as the hope of the latter half of their life. But never they themselves [wd7,s-]  	All the thoughts are taken for granted by most women. Are they born with such thoughts?  	In the childhood, while boys are taught to be strong and confident, girls are instilled with agreeability, delicacy, and obedience. Parents would probably tenderly comfort [wd4,1-1] girl when she encounters setbacks. But they would encourage a boy to stand up on his own and fight again. Such education partly explains the attitude of most Chinese women.  	Even though boys and girls get equal schooling, their interests seem to be determined by their sexes. It is arbitory [fm1,-] that girls should be interested in arts, literature and language, etc., while boys are believed to be born scientists, physicians, and technicians, etc.. Few girls escape such prejudice. The proportion of sex in most universities would be sufficient evidence.  	It is beyond doubt that female students would face much greater difficuties [fm1,-] when they are looking for a job. Many working units do not even have the heart to pretend that they give equal chance for boys and girls. They simply would not interview female students. The reasons given by them are that the girls would soon get married and pregnant, this would surely lead to inefficiency. They just neglect the capacity of these outstanding female students. In some cities, female students are even asked to make a rediculous [fm1,-] contract that they would not give birth to child in certain years.  	The inequality also exists in marriage. As mentioned above, marriage plays as the only judgement of most women's life. There is another problem. When choosing a wife, most men would automatically turn to the women who are considered to be "inferior" to them. Even for those men who claim to believe in equality, they are, to some extent, haunted with [wd3,1-] this men's "superiority". Maybe they think that "all men are equal, but some are more equal than others".  	Chinese women's traditional role is at home. It is still believed that women's main job is to look after her family and do house work. Quite a few husbands feel quite at ease to watch their wives doing all the house-hold chores when both of them are just back from the work. And for some men, their ideal life seems to be husband working outside and wife staying inside the family. They, as the supplier [np3,3-] of the family, should be the superior family member [np3,s-]  	When Chinese women begin to fight for equlity [fm1,-] in all aspects, could be [sn8,s-] assume that there must be enormous inequality throughout their whole life?  	The answer is "yes".  (t10-2)  	There are some people today who still hold fast to the idea that "All men are created equal, and all men indeed enjoy full equality." This is not true. As a matter of fact, this has been exactly what we have been longing for, but still unrealized [fm2,-] in actual life. We, either as an individual [np3,4-] or as a whole society, would cease to make progress unless the whole matter of inequality is clearly seen.  	In George Orwell's "Animal Farm", three pigs headed by Napoleon led all the animals to throw away the farmer's domination under the flag of "All animals are created equal". Yet later on they carried out a slogan that "Some are more equal than others". [sn9,s-] so as to get the whole farm under their control and to rule the animals who had devoted themselves to the cause of equality. Even in animals which have not got as much brains as men, there is no equality. How about men?  	All men are made equal, but they are treated differently, not to mention those in slavery system and feudalism [wd2,4-1] society. Slaves were not regarded as human beings, but the same as a tool [np3,s-] a walking and talking tool. Serfs, peasants were also regarded as one of the properties [np5,s-] of landlords. There is no equality to say as long as no freedom exists.  	People realized this situation, rose up and finally drove the privilidged [fm1,-] class away. They establish a society in which they firmly hold the belief that "Everybody enjoys equality". That is not the case. As a matter of fact, they enjoy various kinds of inequalities [cc3,4-] Yet people are blind to it and still cry out merrily that "we are happy as equals."  	There are many inequalities today, observed or ignored, which have done and would do great harm to our society.  	The most obvious is the inequality between men and women. In spite of the fundamental principle that all men are created equal, prejudice against women has long existed. Over centuries, men have been training and teaching women to believe that women are inferior and to accept their superiority. This [wd3,s-] is unfair that the world's most of the top positions [wd1,6-] in society, like company director [np6,2-] judges, are occupied by men. This is a male-dominant world. They confine women to house and block their way to full exploitation of their capacity and potential; they give women refusals [np1,-s-] to important posts just because they have children; they get more easily [ad1,s-] promoted than women; they do much less house chores than their wives. Worst of all, they take all these for granted. There exists not-in-the-least equality between male and female.  	The lack of equality also lies between the old and young, either in work or at home. At home, the old's [cc1,-1] authority shall not be shaked [fm2,-] or, it is to be claimed [vp1,2-2] as unfilial[fm1,-]. At work, people get promoted and find good chances according to their age and experience, in spite of their ability. [wd4,-2] Real [wd2,-1] talented are at the bottom of the society. They have no way to give full rein to their abilities and potentials.  	In addition to that, money and authority are the deepest roots of equality. In today's society, these two are worshipped as the highest aim for many to achieve. Money makes the mare go. So long as you have money, everything is in your reach, even love. So long as you have authority, there is nothing which you cannot get, even it [fm7,s-] is illegal. Rich and authorised people are entitled to get privileges almost in every way. Yet the poor and plain, but talented, could hardly make ends meet and live miserably at the bottom of [wd4,1-2] social ladder. This brings differences to their children too. Rich children with family backgrounds [wd7,4-] are not the students to their teachers, but the parents to them. The teachers flatter them so as to get their parents' favor. Could all this mentioned be called as "equality"?  	There are many other equalities besides the ones mentioned above, such as that in the field of religion and that between poor and rich countries. In short, when we cast our eyes throughout the world, equality seldom unfound [wd7,s-] [sn9,s-] what comes into our sights is absolute inequality.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH B2W> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (b2w-t10-1)  Once I was tempted to step into a splendid department store. Then I found myself wondering in a dreamland: The [fm3,1-] hall was ablaze with light; The [fm3,1-] sales girls all wore beautiful uniforms; [fm3,1-] The price of the goods are [vp3,3-2] [vp6,s-] astonishingly high to me, and I was even astonished to see so many people buying them. People around me all dressed decently, taking money out of their pocket casually. For the first time, I was aware that I was a poor girl.  I am a 22-year-old college student. Like many of my schoolmates, I am supported by my parents. I needn't worry about food and clothing, [sn9,-s-] I spent most of the time to do [vp5,s-] what I like to do but I still feel unhappy. "Dull" is the very word [wd4,s-] we describe our life. But last year, one of my former class-mates got married. She became a worker in a textile factory after finishing primary school. She worked 8 hours a day in a noisy workshop, hard and busy. When I met her in the street, I found she talked and behaved just the same way as those middle-aged, uneducated women.  I had a friend, who was very intellegent [fm1,-] and handsome. We all liked him and thought that he would be a writer some day because he was very talented in writing. But he died at the age of eighteen. He got cancer. While several days before, I saw an idiot, who was almost naked, lying in the middle of the cold street, neglecting the shout of those angry drivers. He was at least 40 years old.  We often hear the saying "All men are equal". But obviously, it's a lie. Why can't I enjoy equal service and get the same amount of smile from the sales girls as a millionair [fm1,-] ? Why can't my classmate have a chance to be a professor? Why can't a good boy live a little longer? The question marks are endless. How can men be equal? Equal, according to the Webster's, means: 1. having the same rights, privileges, ability, rank, ect. [fm1,-] 2. having the necessary ability, strength, power, capacity, or courage. 3. fair, just, impartial. If we using [vp4,s-] this as a standard, human beings will never be equal to one another, because men are born unequal. So a wise person corrected and complemented the sentence like this: All men are equal, but some are more equal than others.  In a society made up of human beings, there are always somebody [pr3,3-] who have more pocessions [fm1,-] enjoy more rights and privileges, are more talented or strong. so long as one cares about others and campares [fm1,-] oneself to [wd3,s-] others, he will never find equality. He can be either superior or inferior to others, but he cannot be equal to them. As the proverb describes: "Comparison reveals astonishing differences." Since we have standard [np6,2-2] to judge things and there are differences between things. Thus in our thoughts, some girls are prettier than others, you are luckier than I, I am cleverer than another guy. Therefore there are such words we want to entitle ourselves with: the rich, the powerful, the strong, the outstanding, ect. [fm1,-] In a word, men are not equal politically, economically and physically. One can only be equal to others spiritually. You can THINK you are equal to others but you can never BE equal to others. (b2w-t10-2)  In the Declaration of Independence, we see that "all man [np3,1-1] are created equal". But since the human society came into bring [vp1,2-] inequality has often been in the world: slave-owners sought pleasure but slaves were forced to toil day after night; thousands of years later, that's, in [wd5,-1] nowadays, we see some people are living in crowded slums but others in coastal villas, some children are playing in the park but others are crying for starve. So in his novel Animal Farm Geoge Orwell pointed out that "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others." How true is it?  What means equal? Does it exist or is it just our ideal? What causes inequlity [fm1,-] and which way leads to equality on earth? In the dictionary, equal means "the same in size, amount, degree, value etc.." According to this definition, equality can never be reached for there are absolute identity [wd7,s-] [wd4,s-] most important is that "the same" is not our aim.  To a nation, equality refers to independence without being controled [fm2,-] by foreign colonies [wd3,s-] that is, one nation is a sovereign state and has its territorial integrity. To a government, equality refers to a government of people other than that of some special groups of people. In such a government, leaders are all elected and supervised by people and the laws are all made according to people's will. To a person, equality means that his or her ability is appreciated no matter the white or black [sn8,s-] the rich or poor, man or woman he or she is.  Equality is not the gift from God, on the contrary, it is the natural result of evolution and revolution. Fight [np6,-2] for equality never stops though most of [wd4,1-1] world is in [wd4,1-2] peaceful situation. Without bitter struggle [np6,2-1] chinese [fm3,1-1] people can't get rid of foreigner's [np6,s-] control. Without bitter struggle, people in South Africa has [vp3,4-] no right of voting.  The importance of equality was awared [fm2,-] [cc2,s-] gradually in the past thousands of years, and the equal rights are got [vp7,1-] more and more [wd7,s-] Men first understood that they were born inequally [fm2,-] and used to it, [sn1,s-] later, as the society improved and the horizen [fm1,-] is [vp6,s-] broadened, common people were not contented with their inferior socal [fm1,-] status which did not match their economical status. They bagan [fm1,-] to claim the same rights with the nobleman and then they even fought for erasing the noble classes. In China, Cheng Sheng in Qing dynasty cried out: "Was man born a nobleman or slave!" We know, equality cannot be got easily, we will never forget that Martin Luther King who [wd5,s-] was killed 25 years ago. But now more and more people tend to think that they belong to a classless society, in which privileges and rewards are equally available.  We are looking forward to equality, on the other hand, we have to admit the difference between one and another. Someone is really more capable than others. So equality really means equal opportunity. Man should get what he deserves though [fm1,-] his hard-working. Positions are limited and the [wd5,s-] competition is the only way to get it. Competition is believed to strengthen the ideal of equal opportunity. It is also seen as an open and fair race where success goes to the swiftest person regardless of his or her social background. But once they success [wd2,1-] they became richer [wd4,-s-] and superior [aj2,3-2] than others --- a kind of inequality appears.  In whole [pp21-] absolute equality doesn't exist, what we can achieve is the equality of opportunity.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GW> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (t11-1)  	In the words of the old song "money is the root of all evil", there is something amiss. Only economic motive [np6,2-1] can not account for all evil of the pell-mell world. Even we add erotic motive [np6,2-2] [cc3,2-2] and ambition, the picture is still incomplete. There are [vp3,1-3] still something else. Money is not the root of all evil.  	Take Freuds at first, he insists all craves [wd2,1-1] come from sex desire. People suffer, worry, agonize and dream, because they long for or fear sex, because they have been raped or have not. Here money surely makes no sense.  	And there is no need to mention the sin. Adam and Evil certainly don't know what money is. Is it a result of hint, or instinct, or curiosity, [sn9,s-] no one knows.  	And here comes Chao Guilin, the author of the novel "Beijing Natives in New York". After he became famous, he claimed triumphantly that all his life he persued [fm1,-] two things: fame and women. He went back to Beijing, slept with numrous [fm1-] girls in hotel without knowing their names. He announced in newspaper that his wire [wd3,s-] was an other [fm2,2-1] woman though he hadn't divorced with his original wife [pp1,4-] What's all this due to?  	Ambition, sometimes, leads directly to evil. What the Godfather has done is all evil, but he did these for the friendship from all people (at least it seems so). And those politicians did their dirty work only for paving their road to the White House. People's aspiration to be insome [fm2,2-2] inner ring is also inevitable and unexplanable [fm2,-] and "as long as you are governed by that desire you will never get what you eant [fm1,-] ", and what's all this attributed to?  	And how about UNFORGIVEN? Those villains who hurt the girl are certainly deserved [vp7,s-] panelth [fm1,-] but is the hero right to kill them that way? it's [fm3,-] not only revenge, It's evil, blood is evil, it's unforgiven [fm2,-] In Marabar caves in A PASSAGE TO INDIA Mrs Moore is stunned and horrified by those evil echoes" If several people talk at once, an overlapping howling noise begins, echoes generate echoes, and the cave is stuffed with a snake composed of small snake [np6,1-] which writhe independently". It's an imaginable feeling, but not explainable. It concerns religion, culture and all those perples [fm1,-] things, [sn9,s-] can all this be attributed simply to money?  	That's why I say money is not the root of all evil, and on the other hand, money sometimes can be the root of some happiness.  	My university is now setting up an exchange programme with Lancashire University, which is in Britain. The exchanged students are selected rather by their economic background than [wd4,s-] their academic performance. Because the living and studing [fm1,-] in Britain for one year needs at least 130,000 yuan [sn2,s-] How many of us can afford it? So those lucky rich ones grasp this opportunity. That's what money can buy, furthur [fm1,-] education and widening of eyesight. (it's hapiness [fm1,-] isn't it?)  (t11-2)  	In an old song there is a popular saying that money is the root of all evil. The saying seems to be true and convincing enough to be accepted at first sight. However, on second thoughts I find it scientifically untrue. Money, whether in the past, or at present, or in the future, is never the root of all evil [np6,1-] because it is originally pure and contribute [vp3,s-] a lot to social progress. 	  	Money itself is not an evil. It is but a product of commecial [fm1,-] development, represting [fm1,-] nothing but the value of goods in exchange. Money has been used [vp7,s-] to be described as dirty, stinking or bloody, furthermore, as the root of all evil [np6,1-] Money is not dirty, stinking or bloody in [wd4,s-] original sense. It is people who make money appear so by doing everything they can for the sole purpose of earning the largest possible amount of money. Someone may question: "Isn't it money that prompts people to do so?" I do not want to answer this question at once. Instead, I want to ask a question first. If money is the root of all evil, does it mean that there was no evil before money appeared, or [vp9,s-] it mean that money is the root of all evil that emerged after its appearance rather than before? It is not impossible that evil has a longer history than money. Then how can money be the root of all evil? In addition, is it fair to hold money responsible for everything evil? If money is evil, the evil results from people who improperly use it. 	Money is one of the basic elements of human life and modern society. Firstly, man can not live without money. In this commodity society, everything like food, clothes, housing and travelling is exchanged by means of money. As long as you live, you have to be fairly closely connected with money. Secondly, money is necessary to economic development. To develop economy requires a substantial sum of money as financial backing for establishing factories, upgrading enterprises, providing advanced equipment and applying advanced knowledge. Capital is need [vp9,2-2] to bring in more profits, which will push economy going [vp5,2-] forward. That is the reason why China is thirsty for foreign funds. Thirdly, money is necessary to [wd4,s-] development of other sectors. Economy is the foundation of every other sectors [np3,2-] Only if [pr5,-s-] economy has been developed, [sn8,s-s-] other sectors have ample chance to develop. Developed economy means more capital available for other uses. Then it will be possible that railroads extend to remote places, IDD communication network cover [vp3,3-] more regions and new types of space shuttles are produced for further exploration. And people will be able to enjoy higher salary, shorter work hours, more convenient transportation system [np6,3-] and cultural facilities. In some sense, money is the root of social development.  	Nothing can be done without money. Though what money brings to the society and every individual is a little difficult to tell, it is certain that evil is only the by-product of the widely [wd2,2-2] use of money and is mainly due to [wd4,s-] dark sides of human nature. Money should not have been blamed for producing all evil.  (t11-3)  	In my opinion, I quite agree with this point of view that money is the root of all evil.  	In a sense, money is the most important thing in our life. Without money, it is impossible for you to lead even a homely life. On the other hand, you can even buy with money peerage granted by queens of the United kingdom [fm3,2-] due [fm3,s-] to the importance, everyone is crazy about money. The poor want more money to keep alive, the rich want more money to afford their luxuriant life or just to enlarge their property. As a result, many people make money by illegal means regardless of their fame and life. Such phenomena are very common. Many young women long for a luxuriant life. But they cannot afford such a life by earning legal money. So they take up a career as a hooker [np3,s-] to earn money to meet their needs. [sn9,s-] while some men are engaged in drug trafficking at the risk of their lives, although drug trafficking is forbidden throughout the world. The astonishing robbery and arson accident took place recently in Zhijian Province, [sn9,s-] China can be one good example to prove that money is the root of all evil. The accident happened in a travelling boat. Three men jumped on the boat, robbed all people on board of their property, drove them to the cabins under deck and then lit a fire to destroy all the evidences. It was their original aim to rob money [cc3,1-] But in order to succeed, it is unavoidable to kill people to destroy evidences. So, money is the root of all evil. 	Once you are well off, that means you have spare money besides the expense [cc2,-4] affording the daily life. If you donate your money to public welfare, no doubt it is good. But if you think you have money, you can do what you like. So you indulge yourself in gambling, drug or something else. Once again, money is the root of all evil. It is said that in Liaoning Province a young man made 30 million yuan by successfully running a little restaurant. After he had money, he madly clung to gambling. He kept on thinking that he was so rich. [sn9,s-] that he could afford this dangerous game. So he paid no attention to others' advice. Consequently, he suffered a crushing defeat and lost all of his money. Another example is about a foreman in Guangdong Province. This foreman used to be a farmer. After he became rich as a foreman in Guangdong, he thought his original wife was not a match for him. With his large sum of money, he remarried a young urban girl. 	In a word, money is the root of all evil [sn9,s-] 	  (t11-4)  	Is money the root of all evil? To my understanding, the answer is no. Money is no more than a medium for the purpose of exchanging. It serves to help people realize their dreams. 	  	In this sense, I emphasize that money is firstly not a root of anything. Although people try to earn money [wd1,s-] as much as they can, they are not making money to achieve a more comfortable, successful life [cc3,5-] ; they are making money to satisfy their needs and desire. Money is not the ultimate aim, never. 	On the other hand, it is acurately [fm1,-] true that, in order to speed up your approaching steps towards the crown of victory, you have to find some money in most cases. Whatever your motives are, without enough money, you might even starve to death. In such a circumstance, people endeavour to earn money with every effort. Some of them do that by hook or by crook. Every possible means have [vp3,3-] been used, including the illegal ones. Therefore we read stories telling us that in order to make money, sons kill fathers, husbands kill wives, houses burn, airplanes clashed...... [sn9,s] All these terrible scences [fm1,-] impress us that money, if not the root of evil, is essentially one of the causes of evil. But, don't miss the point that all those evil souls doing [vp4,s-] evil things not because they just want to get money for the sake of money, they have desire, evil or not, to be satisfied. They might intend to climb up to the upper society, to get an offical [fm1,-] position, to lead an extravagent [fm1,-] life, etc. It is desire that arouse [vp3,s-] their greedyness [fm2,-] not money. So, if we really trace the source of evil, we find evil desire and only evil desire. Money is but one necessary thing to get in their pursuit. 	When people say that "Money is the root of evil", they do mean that money is closely connected with evil. Surely I am not in favour of this idea. Money, I repeat, is no more than a medium, a tool, [sn1,s-] whether it will be [vp6,s-] concerned with evil is not decided as soon as it was born. The question of "what money is" has no definate [fm1,-] answer. Its function and essence vary from person to person. Every man has his personal judgement and explanation. In regard to this, we may say that for people who regard love, health, etc as their essential needs, in other words, people who pay less attention to the allumants [fm1,-] of the material world, money plays a trivial part in their mind. In addition, people of this kind have no evil targets but only pure motives, they keep a distance from evil. And, when these people are making money, money causes no evil. That is to say, money is certainly not necessarily connected with evil.  	It is a fact that we cannot live without money. A country's development needs money, a poor orphan needs money. Money brings us food and living place and happiness. Only if you are a noble person. [sn2,s-] Money's nature is decided not by God, but by the man who pursuing [vp4,s-] it, or, by the nature of his desire.   Finally, I'd like to conclude that money is not the root of evil, never.  (t11-5)  	"Money is Not the root of all evil", when hearing someone say that money is the root of all evil I will say without hesitation. 	  	Money has existed for thousands of years. In order to avoid the inconvenience caused by the exchange of goods, people invented money, just for the sake of convenience. And it really did. As time went on, money became a kind of symbol of wealth. The rich was rich because they had much money and the poor was poor because [cj1,-3] lack of money. Then, too much difference between the rich and the poor made a society unstable. At this time, someone would rise up and say: "Look, all these unrest and evil things are provoked by money, [sn1,s-] it is the root!" In fact, the root is not money itself, but the unjust social distribution system. In order to establish a more reasonable one, the poor tried to overthrew [vp5,1-] the rich by arms. And without money, how could they get arms? From their enemies' hands? Maybe they could. But you should amid [wd7,s-] that their enemies' arms was also a product of money. May I say that money is a mainspring of the development of a society?  	In daily life, we often hear someone else say, "Well. It is money that corrupts him" or "He used to be an honest man, but money does great harm to him. Oh, evil money!" Actually, money does not corrupt people nor does it do harm to people. What cause [vp3,s-] the touble [fm1,-] is the way people earning [vp4,s-] money or spending [vp4,s-] money. Money is attractive, that's true. Few people can resist this irresistible temptation. Many people have the desire to own more money. And some try in legal ways while others try to get possible big money [cc4,2-] by doing shady activities [cc4,2-] Maybe you will say, "Those people will not do such disgusting things if there is no money in the world. And all the evil things will disappear immediately." That may be right. But, Do [fm3,s-] you ever think about another question, that is, "What will the world be like if there is no money any more?" Do you think that we should go back to the primitive society? 	Money is not the root of all evil. On the contrary, it can help people doing [vp5,s-] many beneficial or useful things. With it, you can buy a ticket to enjoy a music concer [fm1,-] or an exciting football match. With it you can donate several dozen yuan to help a poor rural country boy in China to go to school. With it, some people can build a school or even a university for the local residence [wd3,s-] Like Li Jia Chen of Hongkong, he has donated more than 0.8 billion HK$ to Shanton University in eastern GD. When you visit this university, seeing numerous Spanish style buildings standing between trees and flowers and thousands of students studying, playing there, could you imagine what the land was like before the university being built? Surely you can not deny that money has played an important role. There are many other convincing examples. One can find out himself. And that is all I have said for this topic.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH ZD> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (t11-1)  	When we criticize the capitalist society, we like to use the description "the evil monetary relationship among the people". However, since "the open and reform" policy was carried out in China, people are richer than ten years ago [sn4,s-] but social problems such as the crime rate increases [vp3,s-] as a result. People sing the old song words "Money is the root of all evil" again. Should money take all the blame?  	I think this point of view is too partial. It is well known that money is only a means to measure the value of goods, and itself [wd3,s-] hasn't any value. It is human beings who are responsible for all the evil things. Acquisitiveness is one of the important factor [np6,4-] contributory to the crimes. In the ancient time, because productivity was not well-developed, people suffered a lot from starvation. In order to acquire enough food, shelter and clothes, they started wars, killed their enemy and seized others' land and food. As the economy is developing, most people are not worried about their living necessities any more. But their insatiable desires to acquire more property, power and achievement induce them to take some measures, esp. some illegal ways to reach their goals. Therefore, many crimes such as murder, robbery and embezzlement emerge. Though most of the crimes are committed for money, it is not money itself [wd4,s-] should be blamed.  	 Moreover, we should see money bring us a lot of good. We can use it to exchange others' commodity which we can not produce ourselves without fighting or stealing. It enriches our life and makes [vp1,-4] our society running [vp5,3-] ahead.  	In short, it is unfair to blame money for causing crimes or other evil deeds. It is only a perfect excuse for people to escape from their evil motivation or insatiable acquisitiveness. I hope in the future, all people can live richly, happily and peacefully and the old song "Money is the root of all evil" won't be sung any more.  (t11-2)  	An old song sangs [fm2,-] "Money is the root of all evil". These words contain a lot of truth. However, I do not agree with it to some extend [pp2,2-] In my opinion, money may cause much evil, but not all evil is caused by money.  	Because money is so important in our life, for it many people commit some crimes, such as embardement [fm1,-] bribery, robbery, murder, etc. or behave immorally to cheat or slander others. Money contributes much to evil and this is why the old song sangs [fm2,-] so. However, besides money many factors can lead to evil, such as power, envy, vanity or even love, etc. Some people desire for power, so in order to achieve their goal, they will do something evil. There are good examples. In the ancient time, sons of a king fighted [fm2,-] each other to control the country. In our modern life, some will slander others to get a high position. Envy will lead to evil. Some people envy others because of their position, prestige or knowledge, and they will intimidate, slander or racketeer others. Vanity will lead to evil. Those students who want to get high grades for scholarship but are afraid of their capabilities will cheat in the exams. Love will also lead to evil. Some people will try everything (beating, blackmail, or even killing) to get rid of their love opponents. So, many things may lead to evil and even the same evil may be caused by different things.  	Actually nearly everything can be the root of evil. It depends on the background, the situation, the people, and so on. But I have to confess that money is the root of most evil because of its important role in our life. So, I'd rather say, "Money is not the root of all evil, but is the root of most of it."  (t11-3)  	Modern people have an ambivalent attitude toward money. On the one hand, they try to acquire as much as they can, on the other hand, especially those who have failed in their hard fight for money, they indignantly accuse it as the root of all evil. However, in my opinion, money itself is either something bad or good, it is human being's [np6,s-] endless desire for money that is the root of all evil.  	I agree with a number of my fellow members on their views about money that, [sn9,s-] money do [vp3,s-] not mean everything, but without it, we can not do anything. But many of them have simply gone too far about the role played by money in the society and taken it as an [np7,-1] perfect excuse for their dirty tricks in getting money. Indeed, it would be a disaster for one in modern society to live empty-handedly, even for a short period of time. He needs money to pay the food, shelter and clothing --- three basic living necessities, and if he has a family to support, then he will demand much more, for his children's education and his parents' and parents'-in-law living fee, and certainly he has the duty to pay all kinds of taxes, whether willingly or unwillingly, determined mostly by the government.[sn8,s] The list goes on and on with which the reasonable desire for money grows.  	However, people are not satisfied with a quiet and regular life apart from financial problems [wd7,s-] they long for luxuries those wealthy people enjoy. In order to acquire all these unnecessary goods, some of them have come up with various devices, legal or illegal, evil or justifiable, to acquire the money they need. They cheat people; in a desperate situation, they even cheat their best friends, abandon their cozy family, some even kill a stranger for just a small sum of money. It is obvious that their endless desire for money have [vp3,1-1] turned them from a nice person into a cold-blood animal.  	Moreover, the society should take part of the responsibility for this phenomenon, to put it straight, it stimulates the bad side of human nature --- desire for money. How much money a person gain [vp3,5-] has become the only means to value him. therefore [fm3,-s-] he has to try to prove himself by gain [wd2,1-5] as much as he can, in order to gain respect from his fellow members. The whole society has come to such a stage where it believes [vp7,s-] that those who can gain a lot of money is [vp3,s-] the most able [aj3,2-] in the society, needing not [vp9,s-] concern [wd4,4-] how they get it.  	Since the ancient time, money has been considered as the root of all evil, but in my mind, it is only an excuse used by human beings for their endless desire for wealth and fame --- They shift their own responsibility to the innocent object. As I have mentioned above, it is their endless desire for money that is the root of all evil.  (t11-4)  	There was an old song in the west, which said that "Money is the root of all evil". I personally agree with it. Money is the wise creation of our human beings. It is used as a tool to value things. It itself is worthless. So we human beings should not be controlled by money. But now in our society, in this world, too many people are crazy about money. They pursue money and wealth at all expenses, ignoring the benefits of others and even the whole society. They have become slaves of money.  	Money indeed causes us a lot of troubles. When people are poor, they worry about money with which they can buy bread for their families and everyday necessities. But when people are rich, they also worry about money. They are afraid of their money being stolen by others. But compared with other big troubles caused by money, these minor troubles are not worth mentioning. First, Money is the root of crimes. Before the adoption of the pocily [fm1,-] of reform and opening to the out [wd3,-1] world, China is [vp6,s-] a peaceful country with very low crime rate. But now affected by the western value about money, people are more and more money-minded. Take Guangdong as an example, Guangdong province [fm3,1-] is a highly developed area as far as its economy is concerned. And the living standard of Cantonese is higher than other places [sn4,s-] in China. So a lot of people from poor areas come to seek fortune in Guangdong. Some evil-minded, lazy people commit many crimes in order to become rich immediately without laboring hard. Many crimes are appearing around us and people are frightened by them. And local Cantonese also do some very bad things to achieve richness. Some people smuggle and some people take bribery. All they do is just because of money. So money is evil. Second, Money is the worm which underscores [wd7,s-] the noble thoughts of people. In the past, people are [vp6,s-] kind to each other and willing to help each other without hesitation. But now, the relationship between people seems to be based on money. While some people are doing things, the first thought they have is whether it is good to them or whether they can benefit from it. So money makes people become selfish instead of noble. Some people are indefferent [fm1,-] to other people and even the society. When they do help other people, they ask for menoy [fm1,-] at a compensation for their work. [sn8,-]So having money as an influence, the society seems colder than before.  	Money is the root of all evil. In order to get rid of all these evil things in our society. We should take an appropriate attitude towards money. We should know that having money doesn't mean having everything, there is something which is more precious and valuable in this world such as love, friendship and happiness, which with money we can not buy. Thinking about these, we will gradually get rid of the influence of money upon ourselves, and our society will face a brighter future.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH B2W> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (b2w-t11-1) 	Today money always bothers us. All the advertisements seem to tell us that money is most important which can buy [cc3,-3] success, position, happiness. Little by little, people believe that what you can get deponds [fm1,-] on how much you earn. In their point of view, a millionare [fm1-] is not only the richest but also the happist [fm2,-] person in the world. So people are greedy to get money. A poor fellow dreams that some day he can become a rich man; a rich man wants more. No one says his money is enough. People fight for money, cooperate for money, deceive for money. To get more money many persons step on the road of evil. It seems that money is [wd4,1-3] root of evil. But if people use [wd4,2-4] money of people for people, money will benefit us a lot. The evil is not from the eagerness of getting more money but from the desire of occupying [cc3,-1] money by oneself. This bad spirit is born with people. However it doesn't show obviously at [wd4,s-] usual time, [sn9,s-] once it is arisen [vp1,3-3] by some desire, it will lead people to hell. So everything has two sides, the bright side and dark side. So does money. We can not only pay attention to its dark side, but ignore its other side [wd7,s-]  Basically, money is useful. It's necessary for people's surviving. If you have money, you will get better medical care and you can have better education. So, money is also important in [pp1,-3] improve people's spirit. In people's spare time, people are willing to enjoy the spiritual pleasure. They take part in many activities, such as, [sn9,s-] [vp5,s-] to go to cinema, exhibition, music concert, and to travel, to go sightseeing, etc.. But all these cost. You have to pay extra money for extra happiness. In business if a company has strong finantial [fm1,-] support, it can be very competitive and extend its business. Material flourishment [fm2,-] paves the way for us to enrich our spiritual life. So, in many people's eyes, money equals [vp1,-2] to wealth, happiness and position.  However, if people think money is omnipotent, worshiping money, it [wd5,2-] will be the root of evil. Because of money, many crimes occur. In this case, money is harmful to our society. It causes bribery and corruption. People are lured [vp1,2-3] to get money by all means, even offending against law. Money is also the basic reason for the break [wd3,s-] of wars beteen [fm1,-] countries. For example, the Gulf War was tipically [fm1,-] caused by money. Oil brings Quwait the richness. Its wealth made Iraq jealous. To own [cc3,1-2] such richness, Iraq broke the peace of the world. So, money can be people's ruin.  Since money's position can not be dicided [fm1,-] only upon one side, it is our responsble [fm1,-] to make money honestly and to use money correctly. Money may be the root of evil, if its owner has evil's [cc1,-1] heart. (b2w-t11-2)  I can't agree on [pp1,-]this opinion, because money, as the measurement of value, a medium of exchange and store [cc1,-2] of value has greatly promoted the development of economy, improved the living condition of human being [np6,2-] by facilitating the exchange of commodities.  When I say money is not the root of evil, I mean, it's people's evil desire that makes them evil, not money.  As a Chinese old saying says, the water can make a boat float, it also can make a boat sink. The same thing can lead to contrary results. This is not due to the nature of the thing, but to the different methods people adopt to make use of them [pr3,s-] If people know how to steer the boat, he will have few chance [np3,1-] to sink. But if he knows little about it, it would really be dangerous for him to sail.  The same is true with the use of money. As we all know, money serves as standand [np6,s-] of value, a medium of exchange, and store [cc1,-2] of value. The three major functions accelerate the development of commodity economy. It enables people living in different areas to exchange their products in an easy way. It also enables the government to make precise statement of its naional [fm1,-] economy and make [cc3,15] finacial [fm1,-] budgets and monetary policy to adjust its economy [cc3,2-] Thus, the country's economy can develop in a healthy and balanced way. So, in this way, money can and will promote the development of human beings, and it's not the root of evil at all.  People who say money is the root of evil should regard money's three major functions as the goal realizing of their desires or ideals [wd7,s-] For example, a person steals money to buy a luxurious car, and the money he stole [vp6,s-s-] is aimed [vp1,2-2] to pay for a blind lady's medicine fee. At last, the thief is put into prison and the poor blind lady's eyes are not cured, [sn1,s-] so some people say it is money that lures [vp1,1-4] the thief to commit a crime. But this is quite wrong. It is the thief's desire for getting the luxurious car without hard work luring him to do it [sn8,s-] Money is innocent. It just serves as a medium of exchange, as payment for the car and medicine fee as well.  All in all, money to human beings, just as water to the boat, can help us, and can also kill us [sn8,s-] But the key to the using of money is in our hands. If we want to eliminate the evil things, we should not degrade money, instead [sn9,s-] we should improve people's moral level and perfect our social system, especially our law system. (b2w-t11-3)  Money is indispensable to human life. But it has a dual nature. People work hard to earn money, and then use it to buy what they want. In this way, money can not only promote the productive forces, but also help to bring about the stability of society. On the other hand, if people believe that money is everything, when they make money by foul means, and try to get rich by an inpermissible [fm2,-] way, money becomes the root cause of all the evil things.  Here is a story in the Bible: The chief priests promised Judas to give him money, because Judas wanted to betray Jesus to them. But when Judas, the traitor, saw that Jesus had been condemned, He was seized with remorse, and returned the thirty silver pieces to the chief priests and elders. "I have sinned," he said: "I have brought an innocent man to his death." So he threw the money down in the temple and left them, and went and hanged himself. Even though Judas committed suicide in order to astone for his crime, he was imprecated by the Christians for thousands of years. What drived [fm2,-] him to do the evil things? It's the money.  From then on, money has became [vp9,1-] the root of all evil.  There are numerous evil things caused by money in Chinese history. For example, in China's Qing Dynasty, after the Empress Dowager CiXi usurped power, she brutally suppressed the 100-day Reform. Then she had the summer palace restored with the funds 130 million taels of silver intended for the development of the navy, which was only to celebrate her birthday. At the same period, she signed many national betrayal treaties with western countries. What she had done had brought calamity [np6,1-1] to the country and the people. Under the lure of money and power, the Empress Dowager became an evil, she betried [fm1,-] her nation at any cost. The money is the root [np1,1-8] to cause a person to be condemned by history.  At present, in our socity [fm1,-] a lot of people are corrupted by the money. The drug smugglers can accomplish their feat because they have plenty of help. They rely on a booming money-laundering industry that serves a clientle [fm1,-] ranging from tax-avoiding coorporations [fm1,-] to the Iranscam [fm1,-] schemers. Marcos, as the former Philippine leader, he [wd5,s-] stashed billions of dollars in foreign banks and set up dummy companies to buy New York City real estates. But he was overthrown by the indignantly resent [wd2,2-1] citizens. So if the heads of states as well as corporate chiefs have concealed [wd4,s-] dirty money, they will lend [wd3,s-] to evil things.  Money is the root cause of all evil things. People may love money, but they should acquire it through honest way [np6,2-] Otherwise, they would get into great trouble. (b2w-t11-4)   When we speak of "all the evil things", we refer to prostition [fm1,-] gambling, smuggling, burglary, robbery, swindle [wd3,s-] murder, assasination [fm1,-] bribery, rape, liaison and so on.   Why do they exist? For some, the root cause is money.   Take prostitution, gambling and smuggling for example, they are the main business in which Mafia engages.   Notorious for the most ancient occupation [np6,3-] in the world, prostitution is ranked as a tourist attration [fm1,-] by Thailand, for it brings  large sum [np6,2-2] of money to support the national economy. Tourists are there for excitement, since they are capable of squandering money and they  are willing to do so. But prostitutes and trans-sextulists [fm2,-] are different. None of them is born to be, but is forced to make a living on it. Since it is an easy way to earn money.   As we know, Las Vagas, Monte Carlo, and Macau are shrines of gamblers who can be rich or poor over night. Why do so many people indulge  in gambling? Obviously, all of [wd4,1-1] people who try their luck there hate  losing money. At the very beginning, if they taste the joys of winning, they  will be anxious to have a stake again in order to win more money; if they  fail, they will also continue their games, expecting to save the money they  lost. Such greedy psycology [fm1,-] makes them take risks.   Recently, New York police seized more than 193 kilograms of heroin worth $277 million while investigating an alleged drug rings [np6,3-] [sn8,s-] includes a French businessman with ties in Ukraine and Singopore [fm1,-] In the past decade, drug networks have developed rapidly and they tend to be internationalization [wd2,2-] They are well-eqipped [fm1,-] with advanced arms and they will remove obstacles recklessly on the way to success. Some of them are even granted asylum by government. In this case, both of two sides are beneficial --- one will avoid a lot of trouble and the other will take advantage of bribes to build his campaign. But in Malaysia, money fails to talk. Drug smugglers will go to [wd4,1-1] scaffold if they are alleged [vp1,2-1] guilty. Facing such severe punishment some of them still stake their life on it, for money is too tempting, which makes them care nothing about people and society, forget about shame.   For some evils, money can not be regarded as the root cause of them. Rape cases, for instance, [sn8,s-] most criminals are not motivated by money but because they are emotionally starved or influenced by the side effect of violence and sextual scene [np6,4-] promoted on TV or in movie. The incident of President Reagon's assasination [fm1,-] is another example, the gunman shot at him in an attempt to draw actress Judy Forster's attention.   In all [pp2,s-] money is not the root cause of all the evil things. Otherwise, people, who make effort [np6,1-2] to get a good job, gain a high salary and lead a good life, should be condemned, for they are in pusuit [fm1,-] of evil. Nevertheless, if people are swamped in money, they will [wd4,1-2] beyond self-control, involved in the evil things. (b2w-t11-5)  There's an old song sings [sn8,s-] : "Money is the root of all evil." No doubt that many people agree with it. But actually, money is not the root of all evil. The root of all evil is the greediness and ugliness in some people's souls.  What is money after all? Looking back, we can see that money came into being as an important landmark of our economic development. It came into being because of its necessity and importance. As time passed by [vp6,s-] money has become more and more important, especially in modern societies. We need money as we need water and air. No one can live without it.  Besides, money can give us enjoyment, fulfill [cc3,-2] our fantacies [fm1,-] So we can see, money itself has nothing to do with evil, it is good, it's useful. However, evil always appears around money because of its great importance and value. So money is blamed as evil, too.  However, can we say that weapon [np6,1-2] is evil, because it could wound people or even kill them? We know that is not fair, don't we? Weapon itself has no life. If there was no hand on a weapon, how could it hurt? So is money [sn2,s] It could not hurt by itself.  Money could be bad, or even evil, if it was in the hands of some evil people, just like a weapon could hurt if it was controlled by the devil. We wouldn't blame weapon [np6,1-3] for its killing, then why should we blame money as  "the root of all evil"? It is true that many people have sold their souls to devil [np6,1-] just in order to get more and more money. But it is those people's greediness for money which drives them to do all the evil things, not the money itself.  Like weapon [np6,1-1] money could kill, but it could save life as well. The important thing is to see who has it and how to use it. The money could help the homeless people, it could give strength to many poor scholars and students to carry on. Money, [sn9,s-] could also bring those refugees, women and children in Bosnia, food and fuel, give them some basic material to face another severely cold winter. It can bring them life!  Well, money always reminds me of the Aladdin's lamp. It is so powerful. The owner could do good with it, or do evil. It's totally the owner's choice, not the lamp's. The money is just like this magic lamp. It is neither evil nor god [wd3,s-] [sn1,s-] it's totally controlled by people. So now, the only thing we can do is to pray: never let the money be in the control of a greedy hand. Let the [wd5,1-3] it [wd5,s-] goes [vp4,3-] where it's most needed. (b2w-t11-6)  There are some words in an old song: "Money is the root of all evil." I have to say, [sn9,s-] they are nonsenses [np5,-]  If money is the root of all evil, why does it become more and more important in the morden [fm1,-] socity [fm1,-] ? Do we need evil? If money is the root of all evil, how dare the government pay us salary? If money is the root of all evil, why do all the people want to be rich? Do they want to be vicious? And what about the millionares [fm1,-] ? What do they actually have? Millions of dollars or millions of roots of all evil? If they are so dangerous, why does not the police pay a special attention to them? What a saying!  Actually, money is just like water. The water [np5,-s-] as we all know, is very impartial. Put into a glass, it is round. Put into a box, it is square. You can do with it as you like. It is equal to every one, [sn1,s-s-] no matter who you are, [sn9,s-] a prime minister or an ordinary person, as long as [wd3,s-s-] you drop into the water, and did not know [vp6,s-] how to swim, you will be drown [vp9,2-] It is fair to every one. Money is just the same. Save it, it is yours, [sn9,s-] spent it, it is someone else's. With money, you can buy the thing [sn8,2-1] want; without money you can only watch. So, I can say, money treats everybody pretty equal [wd2,3-] But how do we treat money? If money belongs to the person who is good it is the "gold money", but if the money is owned by some person [np3,1-] vicious, it is "dirty money" or even "the root of all evil." Shit! It is unfair. Money is money, it is nothig [fm1,-] else.  As we know, with money, we can turn our desires into reality pretty easy than [aj3,2-] the person who don't [vp3,3-] have money. So, the most important thing is what kind of desire do [wd5,s-] you have. With a kind mind[cc4,1-], maybe you will use your money to set up some charitable institutions, or, donate your money to schools or churchs [fm2,-] --- that we call charity. But with a vicious desire, maybe, you will use your money to harm people --- that we call evil. Therefore we can see, [sn9,s-] with money you can be charitable but also you can be evil [wd2,-] that means, [sn9,s-] you can be two kinds of persons, but, money still is money. What make [vp3,1-4] the thing different is how you use the money. Thus, money is rather "means" of all evil than "root". It is just a bridge ( If you want to call that). Kind minds[cc4,1-] --- money --- charity [sn2,s] Vicious desires --- money --- evil.  On the other hand, some poor persons, [sn9,s-] [sn5,s-] they do not have money, yet they still commit crimes. What's [wd4,1-3] root of their evil? Money? No, they don't have any money, what they have are vicious desires. No, we can see the real root of all evil is not money, but vicious desires.  Money is innocent. Please treat it fairly, just as how it treats you! (b2w-t11-7)  In today's money-worship [fm2,-] world, people regard money as the root of all evils. In fact, money is too innocent to be accused of that --- Money is none the root of any evils [np3,s-]  Firstly, what is money? According to economists, money is a means of exchange of equal values given and accepted when buying and selling. It is a tool of measure that makes our life convenient and smooth. It does not carry any kindness or beauty, nor does it carry any ugliness or evil. So how can money bring about evils to our world?  Secondly, if money was the root of all evils, the whole world should have become an abyss of evils after the birth of money. But who can deny that the world we are living in is a world of love, prosperity and development? Anyone sensible must admit, [sn9,s-] since its birth, money has helped, stimulated and promoted human society to progress and sophistication. Without money, millions of millions of Afican [fm1,-] refugee [np6,5-] would die from hunger and coldness; without money, the nine-year compulsory education would be impossible for thousands of Chinese youth who are eager to receive education but cannot afford the tuition fee; without money, Chinese southerners could not have rebuilt their hometown so quickly after the heavy flood hit; without money, China could not trade with the world and develope [fm1,-] herself stride by stride. All in all, in the history of human socity [fm1,-] money has played such a primary and important role that it has brought to us not only convenience and smoothness, but also prosperity, prospect and promise of our future. So how can money be the root of all evils?  Of course, troubles and problems do come up at the birth of money. As long as one and a half centuries ago, China was looted mercilessly by the Anglo-Saxon Invasion Troop for her invaluable treasure. In modern times, so many people cannot resist the lure of money and they venture [vp1,-4] themselves to satisfy their lust even if they break laws. Take Japan for example, this small country has been the hot-spot throughtout [fm1,-] the world for its notorious government bribery. Italy is also suffering from the same misfortune. Even in socialist China, the CPC is facing a serious problem of money corruption among its party members. However it must be clearly pointed out that all these evils do not root from [wd3,3-1] money itself but root from [wd3,2-2] human being's [np6,s-] misuse of money. Indeed, these evils root from [wd3,3-2] the born greediness, ugliness and evils of human being [np6,2-] It is human [np6,s-] themselves that create all these evils. Money is totally innocent.  We cannot get rid of evils even if we got [vp6,s-] rid of money. We can only get rid of evils if we could get rid of our weakness of greediness, ugliness and evil. If we moralize our people, if we strenghten [fm1,-] our laws, and if we use money properly, we are able to make the world a more prosperous and beautiful one.  Money is not the root of all evils. Money is none the root of any evils [np6,s-] (b2w-t11-8)  Everything has two sides: good and evil, love and hatred, joy and agony, success and failure, prosperity and povelty [fm1,-] Money is not an exception.  As far back as the primitive society when currency as a form of money did not come into use, people led a mean, humble, simple and even barbarious [fm1,-] life. At that time people had to carry heavy goods by horses, cows, or donkeys, walking far away from their home for what they needed. The use of currency ended a lot of convenience [wd3,s-] brought about by barter and narrowed both time and space. Therefore, we can say that money is the sign of social development and progress of human being [np6,2-] to some extent.  Money is the [np7,s-] necessity in our life. Without money, we cannot live, as fish cannot live out of water, particularly in the present day. When we go shopping, we have to bring a sum of money with us; we have to save some earnings for a rainy day; when we are on a trip, we may take credit card [np6,4-] or checkbook [np6,4-] with us if we are wealthy enough, so money becomes a good companion in most cases. A piece of news reports that a man who wants to see how long he can stay outside without any penny goes out and returns three minutes or so later dejectedly. It is easy to see that money now plays an invisibly important role in our life, for we must have money to get along. Nowadays, many intellectuals leave their posts and push themselves into drastic competitions, partly because they cannot bring their knowledge and calibre into full play, and perhaps partly because their incomes are not sufficient to support themselves. So those talented people, in a sense, are forced by the need of money to contend for a better life. If people have to rack their brain [np3,3-] to survive in [wd4,1-2] material world, how can they pursue mental cultivation? Hence, money is an essential element in earthly life.  Moreover, if we have a great deal of money, we can make our life colorful, exciting and kaleidoscopic. We may receive good education to become learned, polite, civilized, reasonable; we may travel around the world to enlarge our scope of vision, enrich our knowledge and to know about the value of life as much, deep and profound as possible [sn8,6-] ; we also may donate some money to charitable institutions to help the poor in the remote, outlying and barren areas out of backwardness, ignorance, povelty [fm1,-] and benightedness. So money is beneficial in this sense.  Yet, some people have a bad impression on money. "Money makes the mare go" reveals the strong power of money but in a negative way. Actually, it refers to some money-crazy people who are willing to let money dominate their mind, thus coming materialists [wd7,2-] In pursuit of money, they may do evil things such as committing crimes, gambling, robbery, theft, kidnapping, murdering, assassination and prostitution as well, which really produces bad impact on other people.  Money is good in one way and is harmful in another. On second thought, we may find whether money is good or bad depends on the people who use it. In a word, money is neither the root of all evil nor the abyss of all good. As long as we make use of money properly, money will surely bring us much more than money itself, such [sn8,s-] civilization, progess [fm1,-] peace, development and prosperity. (b2w-t11-9)  I disagree with the view-point "Money is the root of all evil." This is a lopsided view, because it only treat [vp3,2-] money as a wicked thing, while ignore [vp4,1-4] the value of money.  Evil is around each corner of the world and caused by money. In fact, we should not put the blame on money itself, but should blame ourselves, the holders of money. Just as Pope Leo XIII said, "It is one thing to have a right to the possession of money, and another to have a right to use money as one pleases." If we have evil minds and want to do evil things, obviously, money is the best tool for us. In other words, firstly, we never get money in proper ways. We don't earn money from hard working [pp1,2-] from our wisdom, from our great creations, while [wd3,s-] we use despicable means to get it, such as robbing, stealing, corruption and so on. Thus, all sorts of evil things happened, but they are based on our evil minds, not money. Secondly, we never make use of money in proper ways. We get money from our society, but we don't return it to [wd4,2-3] constructions of society, of our country. We use it to create wars, to do illegal things. So we, the holders of money should be responsible for what are happening.  On the other side, money is very necessary to everything which benefits us, such as building roads, promoting bilateral trade, developing education, especially the "Hope Project" and so on. An English proverb describes money in [wd4,-5] very funny and simple way, "Money is the sinew of love, as of war. Love lasts as long as money endures. When poverty comes in at the doors, love leaps out at the windows." Money is so useful that we need money. No one can do anything without money, especially in the very era of reforming and opening to the outside world. This is a truth.  Money is not the root of all evil, if we can get it and use it in proper ways and if we can get rid of our evil minds. Money should not be the owner of us. On the contrary, we should be owners of money. (b2w-t11-10)  My answer is "yes" and "no". It all depends on what role money plays in your life.  To mencious [fm3,s-] [fm1,s-] "honour and riches are just like floating clouds." Many people, who have the same idea about money as mencious [fm3,s-] [fm1,s-] regard money as mere worldly possessions. They consider it to be something important, useful and necessary, but never indispensible [fm2,-] Because they believe there are much more things much more important than money. Money is just a tool, which may help them get things they want --- justice, friendship, credibility and also power, position and honour. Nevertheless, they are the master [np3,3-] of money instead of a slave. When money becomes only a tool, it can never make them lose their minds. Those, who attach much importance to justice, friendship and credibility, are generous when spending money in helping others; but when they spend money on luxious [fm1,-] things, they become a "miser" [np3,3-] Money can never rule their mind and never dares to bring evil things to its masters. They know how to get money, just like someone said, "gentlemen love money, but obtain it through a right way". They not only know how to get money, but how to spend money. [wd4,s-] Those, [sn9,s-] whose aims are to get power, good positions and honour, who are unscruplous [fm1,-] in the process of acquiring them, even without the intervention of money, evil can find its root in their mind. And [wd4,s-] those, who have abnormal desire such as [wd4,s-] in sex or whose psyche is abnormal, drug-taking, the offense of rape, murder and mistreat [wd2,s-] will happen too. They are not the slave [np3,4-2] of money, but the slave [np3,s-] of improper desire.  Therefore, we can not ascribe all evil to money. Momey [fm1,-] is not able to bring evil to these three kinds of people.  But, on the other hand, if a person becomes the slave of money, money becomes his aim and whole thing in his life, things will change. He must be a mean guy. All he thinks is how to get money and how to save money as much as possible. Just like "Gronte", who is cruel to his wife, his daughter and very unscrupulous when he cheats his daughter to get her money which is inherited from her mother. When a person only cares about money, he will be crazy for money, he will do anything to get it, stealing, robbing, smuggling, selling drugs and all this kind of things.  To them, we may say, that [wd5,s-] it is money which urges him [pr3,s-] to do all these evil things. Money is the root of evil.  Therefore, we say, to those who are the master [np3,5-] of money, money is not able to ruin them; but to those, the slave [np3,3-2] of it, money is the root of evil.  But let us consider [vp1,-3] of it further, we may find that many evil things are related to money. But in the final analysis, we will see it is not money itself [sn9,s-] which creats [fm1,-] evil, but human beings. Because of their unlimited, uncontrollable desire, evil things plant their roots in their mind. So money is not the root of evil, it is only a scapegoat. (b2w-t11-11)  There is an old song singing, "Money is the root of all evil." For thousands of years we Chinese were taught to disdain money. An old Chinese saying told us that a gentleman does not talk about money. Today people often associate money with corruption and degeneration. Is money the root of all evil? Definitely not. The seven deadly sins in religion that are fatal to salvation of the soul are pride, covetousness, lust, anger, gluttony, envy and sloth. Among them, only covetousness, which means greed, is involved in money. The root of evil lies in society. A wicked society breeds evil. Overcrowding, slums, poverty, broken home, war and some other factors can lead to evil. Evil can only be drastically reduced by the elimination of social injustices which is [vp3,3-] just the root of all evil.  As the economy develops, money is playing a more and more important role in our lives. Today, money is often the main topic of conversation, and the desire for money, instead of the centries-old [fm1,-] contempt, has grown proportionately. We live in a material society. Without money, our basic needs in food and clothing cannot be ensured; without enough money, it's hard for us to live a decent life. We are more and more interested in money. In China, "get rich quick [wd2,2-] " has been the spur in our lives. Some people have indeed become rich --- mainly peasants in economically developed coastal areas, performing artists, private business people in urban areas and people with access to special channels. It does not surprise us to discover that success is measured in terms of money. It is not only in [wd4,s-] affluent societies that people are obsessed with the idea of making more money. Consumer goods are desirable everywhere, and modern industry deliberately sets out to create new markets. Gone are the days when industrial goods are [vp6,s-] made to last forever. Money is giving great impetus to the development of economy while the market economy has brought benefits to production costs. Money promotes the well-being of people and brings happiness to them.   George Bernard Shaw said: "Money is indeed the most important thing in the world; and all sound and successful personal and national morality should have this fact for its basis." These words sound reasonable, but in fact, they are not correct completely. Money is one source of evil although it's not the root of all evil. It cannot be denied that there are many wicked things connecting with money in society. Some poor people make money by stealing, robbery, extortion or other illegal and immoral means. Some rich people make money by graft or embezzlement in order to live in luxury and extravagance. They spend money on high consumption without restraint and have never been lavish in giving it to charity and education. They hold the idea that although money is not everything, one can do nothing without money. Thus it can be seen that they do not have a correct understanding of the value of money.  Prices concern everyone, rich and poor alike, and money connects all aspects of society. It is a highly sensitive matter. People should adopt correct attitudes towards money: money is neither the root of all evil, nor everything. (b2w-t11-12)  When thinking about the evils in the world, as big as murder, rape, robbing, stealing, [sn8,s-] as small as cheating, dishonesty and jelousy [fm1,-] we will find that all these evils come from money.  We all know that money is [vp6,s-] an article for the exchange of commodities at the beginning of the society. Later, money became a symbol of position and power. The more money you own the more prestige you may have. From then on, this special feature of money became more and more distinct.  As money is the essential element of human life, people have to get money to support themselves and their families. Some people have the ability to support themselves by their own labours, some people just want to get money easily. They steal others' money, rob banks, kidnap [vp1,-] blackmail [vp1,1-1] or even murder. On the other hand, though some people do not do these serious crimes [cc3,3-] they earn ill-gotten wealth by cheating, such as altering account book [np6,2-] corruption, evading taxes or squeering [fm1,-] others out of their circles.  When people have no money, they want to earn some, [sn1,s-s-] but when they have a lot of money, they will worry [vp1,-4] how to spend them [pr3,s-] Nowadays, to satisfy [wd4,s-] special needs of some big-holders, more and more shopping-centers, restaurants, gambling places, night clubs and some pornograghic places are being built up. These people who have become more and more unsatisfied with their living styles and families, gradually go to these places to get rid of money and gain some novel feelings and sensative [fm1,-] stimulations. Thus, their minds corrupte [fm1,-] Let's see why there are so many private cars appearing in front of the girls [np4,1-1] dormitories. On [pp2,-2] one hand big-holders want to feel complacent through having university students as their part-time lover [np3,6-] ; on the other hand, some girl students want to enjoy what they couldn't have while being a [wd5,1-1] poor. They cannot live without money. They struggle with others for money. So as long as money exists, there must be evils. Only if money is not the basic need of people, evils may have the possibility of extinction. 

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GW> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (t13-1)  	In the 19th century, Victor Hugo said: "How sad it is to think that nature is calling out but humanity refuses to pay heed." Since then, one hundred years goes [vp6,s-] by, however, the situation has not changed yet. It is no wonder that most human beings are said to be a kind of near-sighted creature [np3,s-] What they are doing leads to self-destruction more than development in the end.  	As we know, the global population is growing, which results in the shortage of natural resources. How to match the developement [fm1,-] of natural resources with the explosion of population ? Let's take a few examples.  	First, to solve the problem of food and clothing, we reclaim undeveloped land. It's approapriate [fm1,-] if the land is rationally developed. In fact, we often notice the immediate interests instand [fm1,-] of the long-term interests. We chop the exuberant forests on a large scale. The overchopping [fm2,-] causes soil erosion and land degradation. Consequently grain production reduces. We convert vast prairie to crop fields. Subsequently the harvest is not as good as we've expected, meanwhile, the development of animal husbandry is hindered. Then what can we benefit from it? Nearly nothing. Furthermore, such changes will have deep and long-term ill effect on the coming generations.  	Second, we fish and hunt without raising them [wd7,s-] Therefore, some rare species are in danger of extinction. We have destoried [fm1,-] the biological chain, which will make for catastrophe [np6,s-] Another example, we mine without good organization. That's why some of the landslide [np3,3-] happen. Although we have gained interests from these things, what will our descendants obtain but disasters? As the old Chinese saying goes, we are killing the chicken to get the eggs.  	Third, we develop our economy at the cost of our environment. We discharge industrial waste air, waste water and waste material at random. We live in an enviroment [fm1,-] filled with polluted air, unclear water and trash. Our health is damaged. We hope to improve our living standards, reversely, we are destroying ourselves.  	The above three aspects of development make nature suffer a great deal. To some extent, nature will take its revenge on humanity. Deal with a man as he deals with you. We can't only think of ourselves. We must consider our sons, grandsons and great grandsons. We must take nature's warning seriously. Only when nature is eternal can mankind be eternal.  	Development should be worthy of the name, otherwise we are self-destroying. Nature is not always on the defensive. It will protest, even be on the offensive. If it happens, nature is for sure to win overwhelmingling [fm1,-] It is a traditional Chinese saying that man can conquer nature. Still, it will not be applied every time and every where [fm2,1-] Only when nature and humanity are on good terms can both develop. Pay heed to the call of nature, whether it's good or not.  (t13-2)  	Since human beings came to this world, we started to do things to hurt the nature. We killed wildlife for food; we burnt plants for warmth; we dirtied the water for washing....... After the Industrial Revolution, the situation was getting worse. Billions of trees were cut down to be the material of the industrial producing; millions of hectares of arable land was desolated and became the "pollution producers" --- factories; millions of tons of water was polluted and poured into the rivers and the sea.  	Suffering from such severe destruetion [fm1,-] the nature was calling out for help, but humanity refused to pay attention until in the 20th century. Fortunately, nowadays, people start to concern about this matter. People hear about the nature's calling out. People begin to sit down and think about what we should do to the nature. We know we can't ignore the nature's call any longer. Soil erosion, salination --- alkalinisation and desertification are desolating more and more arable land; over deforestation is devouring more and more forest areas; air pollution is making the fresh air less and less; water pollution is making more and more water can not be drinken [fm2,-] [sn8,s-]..... The nature has suffered a lot, she nearly reaches her tolerant [wd2,1-1] limit. If the nature can't tolerate [vp1,1-2] any more, as a result, there will be horrible disaster.  	Although it is a little bit late for humanity to pay attention to environmental problem, human beings really take some measures to deal with this problem and make some achievements. In many countries, environmental monitoring systems are established, environmental protection laws are made and environmental protection research programmes are in work. Lots of new technique [np6,1-] is put in use on many environmental protection projects. A great deal of money is spent in buying or improving the environmental protection equipments [np5,-] to reduce the pollution of industry. Reasonable quoto [fm1,-] of tree cutting is set, and the authorities encourage people to plant trees. In some countries tree planting became a national policy. Even more, in our country, environmental protection became a basic national policy. Our authority has recognized the harm brought by environmental pollution and an unbalanced ecology, since the 1970's. After a decade of research, it has devised a policy with Chinese characteristics to protect the environment. Our environmental policy focuses on putting prevention first and combining prevention with treatment. China also made laws to ensure that polluters should pay the cost of clean-up and to strengthen environmental oversight.  	From the factors mentioned above, I think Victor Hugo won't feel sad if he could see the changes in present time. Human beings really concern about the nature and try our best to protect the nature, though there are a lot of problems in front of us.  (t13-3)  	Nature refers to the world itself and everything in it not made by man. Man can change nature. Since he first lived in this world, man has been making a constant struggle with nature, trying to reform and improve it in order to make the world more liveable [fm1,-] Nature does not provide man with [wd4,1-1] world. It's man who builds them [pr3,d] like wild rivers and lakes were made by nature [wd7,s-] like channels and reserviors [fm1,-] were made by man. Many original things in their original states or forms are useless to man. But man can make them useful by modifying or harnessing them. A lake can be turned into a reservior [fm1,-] and a piece of wild land can become a vegetable garden or fertile field.  	Although nature can be changed, not all wild things can be better as a result of changes. They can also bring negative results. As a matter of fact. [sn2,s-] There are a lot of things which have become worse and worse owing to changes caused by man. We can see mountains that are no longer green and rivers that are no longer blue. Pollution has become a serious problem and is considered to be a public enemy worldwide. The key problem of pullution [fm1,-] is chemical industry. It is caused by waste gas from automobiles and by smoke from factories using oil as fuel. In Europe there are a number of rivers that are [wd5,s-] used to be extremlly [fm1,-] beautiful but have now been seriously contaminated. Fish can not live and people can not swim. Indeed, the chemical factories are booming prosperously to produce our daily necessities. Whenever a new product comes into being, it immediately wins a [wd5,-2] warm acclamation. Yet, how many [wd4,1-1] know that it is right from these places that millions of tons of wastes are poured into rivers and lakes. This directly harm [vp3,2-] the people's health who [pr1,-] use them as drinking water.  	Besides, such environmental problems as soil erosion, salination- alkalinisation, deforestation and desertification are also threatening the very existence of human species. Though concerned people have made some progress in environmental protection, some governments have established law [np6,1-2] to protect the air, forests and sea resources and to stop environmental pollution, the issue has still not reached enough attention, little action has been taken. So talk of stopping pollution is always in the air.  	Furthermore, progress in science and the improvement of living condition have led to the rapid growth of the world population. Modern medicine, for example, has made it possible for babies to grow up healthily and for people to live longer. With improved living conditions, particularly in the countryside, people tend to have larger families. As a result, the world population has increased so rapidly that it has now exceeded 5 billion. The over-growth of population presents a threat to the existence of human society. A large population demands a great deal of food supply and shelter space. However, the limited productivity and scare [fm1,-] natural resources can hardly meet the needs of the ever-increasing population. Thus, in the long run, the growth of the world population will only harm mankind. Some developing countries in Asia and South Africa, particularly, are blind to family planning program, which leads to serious over population problems.  	It is doubtful, sometimes, whether the development of human society is a kind of progress or not. With the advancement of science and technology, mankind develops more and more ways to conquor [fm1,-] and make use of nature. It is regrettable that a large proportion of people do not realize that the bearings [np5,s-] of nature are limited, they cope with nature improperly, and create many environmental problems. We must bear in mind that only when mankind coordinates the relationship with the holy nature, can we avoid the potential disasters that might be brought by nature, and obtain more from nature.  (t13-4)  	In the 19th century, Victor Hugo said: "How sad it is to think about nature is calling out but humanity refuses to pay heed. [sn8,s-] " Today, though enviromental [fm1,-] problem remains a critic [wd3,s-] one, progress has been made in this aspect.  	The cause of pollution lies in the worst quality of human being --- avarice. After the Industrial Revolution, mankind broke up their overall friendly relation with nature, became its "sworn" enemy. Miles and miles of arable land were turned into construction base. Trees gave way to cement buildings. After more than a century's development, this relation has become more intense, since the flying [cc4,-1] development requires more space, more natural resource [np6,2-1] and at the same time discharges more waste. Startling phenomena can be found everywhere: In the 70s, in the "Silicon Valley" Los Angeles, the boosting of electronic chemical industry caused a yellow fog over the city, because of which thousands of people felt sick, heartache, some even lost their hearing ability. [sn9,s-] --- industry were [vp3,1-] developing at the expense of people's health. This air-pollution accident taught a serious lesson. In China, soil erosion and deforesitation cost the country billions of yuan annually, times of the GNP [wd7,s-] In [wd4,1-2] Antartic [fm1,-] Ocean, thousands of whales were killed every year. All over the world, wild life species are shrinking. All these facts deepen people's doubt: Is human being [np6,2-] going to survive amid what they have done to the nature, the crade [fm1,-] of all creature [np6,2-] ?  	Humanity, being the creature with the highest Intelligence Quato [fm1,-] in nature, begin [vp3,s-] to realize the problem and contrive [vp3,s-] to improve the current situation. Since avarice is deep-rooted in human mind, the war between development and environmental protection is, in fact, a war between avarice and conscience.  	A Texas millionair [fm1,-] set up a closed-up experiment base with all natural phenomena inside, and eight scientists working inside to collect data of the growing of plants and animals, changing of enviroment [fm1,-] etc. The project was emerging [wd7,s-] amid freezing irony and burning satire. But now, it is proved to have farreaching [fm2,-] significance in enviromental [fm1,-] protection, since precious data are being collected to act as the factual base for researchers to fight against pollution and restore cleaners in nature. More similar experiment bases are set up. People are getting stronger and stronger sense of enviromental [fm1,-] protection. Nowadays, news about ecological improvements can be heard more often. There are [vp3,s-] Green-Peace Party with their admirable members petrolling [fm1,-] around in [wd4,1-3] Antartic [fm1,-] Ocean to prevent whale-hunting, sometimes even sacrificing their lives for the sacred mission. There are [vp3,s-] United Nation's Enviromental [fm1,-] and Development Conference, gathering all leaders of the world's nations to discuss how to curb the greedy industrial development and maintain a purer, cleaner world. And China, a comparatively poorer country with the world's largest population has spent large amount of money to nature conservation and has set up a series of laws and regulation [np6,5-1] to boost the enviromental [fm1,-] protection.  	Human being [np6,1-1] is surely foolish in the aspect of distructing [fm1,-] nature, while it is also the only race that can learn from failure and mischieve [fm1,-] it has done and readjust its behavior, that is what made it the master of nature. Faith and patience should be put in the enviromental [fm1,-] affairs. If Mr. Hugo is [vp8,s-] still alive these days, he might alleviate his tone in criticizing humanity's ignorance in protecting nature, after all, only the mankind can save themselves.  (t13-5)  	"Nature is calling out!" People have been always stressing that. But even nowadays, although measures have been taken to restore nature, the achievement is still very insignificant for the damages that humanity has done to nature.  	Environmental pollution and loss of ecological balance are the two reasons for which nature is calling out. Not only nature but also humanity have [vp3,s-] suffered from these for a long time. But the thorough solutions for these are still in the air for the humanity doesn't pay enough heed.  	To a great extent, environment and ecological balance are two decided [wd2,-2] factors of mankind's development. What they head to [wd3,1-] so to speak, leads to what mankind's development heads to [wd3,1-] Because eventually, nature will repay humanity equally for what humanity will has [vp9,1-] done [sn2,s-] Humanity knows it without seeing it; the waste water is still discharging [vp7,s-] into the river, the waste gas is still draining [vp7,s-] into the air; the race animals [wd7,2-] are still being cought [fm1,-] and killed; the forests are still being cut down; the soil erosion is still affecting the land; besides, salinisation [fm1,-] and desertification also contribute to the unbalanced ecology. In order to solve these problems, regulations and decrees have been lain [wd3,s-] down by many governments. But they are not being carried out carefully and thoroughly, many of them are nothing but forms and people just keep ignoring them. Though some people have been punished for violating the regulations, the goal of setting up them has not been fulfiled [fm2,-] yet. Controlling environmental pollution and maintaining the balance of ecology call for improving humanity's quality.  	The harmony of nature and humanity is one of the philosophical thinking of ancient China. As for this, Professor Zhang Dainian from Beijing University, a renowned scholar on ancient Chinese philosophy, has ever stated that mankind is neither the master nor the slave of nature but its friend, and that the two should maintain a harmonious relationship for the good of each other. So, we hope one day, the humanity and nature will become real friends.  (t13-6)  	One century ago, Victor Yugo called for people on the earth to pay more attention to their most intimated [wd3,2-1] friend --- nature. Since then, people all over the world have become more and more aware of the importance of improving the deteriorating enviroment [fm1,-] in order to ensure human being's [np6,s-] existence in the future.  	Great progress has been made in protecting enviroment [fm1,-] and restoring the ecological balanee [fm1,-] Firstly, a lot of country [np3,3-] have established ecological environment reasearch [fm1,-] centers, carrying out intensive study on nature-remaking. Moreover, international cooperation has also been conducted so that the whole human being [np3,3-] could take unanimous action on increasing the enviromental [fm1,-] quality of the earth. For example, June the 5th is set aside as the "World Enviorment [fm1,-] Day." The U.N. Environment programme has defined the theme of the 1994's Enviroment [fm1,-] Day as "One earth, one family." Secondly, various accomplishment [np6,1-1] in enviroment-improving [fm1,-] research had been achieved, in [wd3,-2] some degree, contributing [vp1,-s-] to prevent the enviroment [fm1,-] from further deteriorating. For example, scientists have been studying the reform of energy structure, that is, substituing [fm1,-] the severely-polluting energy such as coal and petrol with the clean energy such as the solar energy, wind enery [fm1,-] and safe nuclear enery [fm1,-] In addition, scentists [fm1,-] are planning to launch solar satellite with the purpose that it may change the solar energy into electric power so that fossil fuel, which causes the increase of CO2 in air can be eliminated. Moreover, apart from full-scale afforestation, scientist [np3,s-] are endeavouring to enable the phytoplankton and algne [fm1,-] to reproduce in tremedous [fm1,-] amount, absorbing CO2 during their process of photosynthesis.  	However, an [np7,-1] universal problem people still facing [vp4,s-] is enviroment [fm1,-] consciousness. On [pp2,-2] one hand, scientists are making great effort to improve enviroment [fm1,-] and deminish [fm1,-] pollution; on the other hand, there are still a lot of people who are never aware of the significance of protecting nature and keep destroying the natural resources. It seems that the more backward the country is, the quicker [wd2,s-] their environment are [vp3,2-] damaged. For example, in Hongkong, a highly-civilized city, most people take their own shopping bags with them to avoid using plastic bags given by the shop assistants when you [sn8,s-] buy goods. Because plastic cannot decompose in the soil and therefore [sn8,s-s-] bring [vp3,s-] great harm [sn2,s-] However, in most city [np3,1-1] of China, plastic bags are becoming more and more popular, no matter how many things you buy, even it is a very little amount, you will be given a plastic bag. It is not uncommon for you to get dozens of plastic bags after shopping in several stores, leading to piles of never-rotten garbage.  	In short, though human being [np6,2-1] have attach [vp9,1-1] greater importance to enviroment [fm1,-] protection, we are still confront [vp9,3-1] the grim situation of worsened nature. Hence, a task of top priority should be strengthening the enviroment [fm1,-] consciousness of the whole human being [np3,3-]  (t13-7)  	In the 19th century, Victor Hugo said: "how sad it is to think that nature is calling out but humanity refuses to pay heed." Fortunately, it is not true nowdays [fm1,-] or at least not totally true. Human beings have received the warnings from the Nature, and many measures have been taken to protect our environment. So I hold a positive view of our future, which will be a green age.  	To creat [fm1,-] a green age is everyone's wish. For instance, Sydney city defeated Beijin city in the campaign for holding the 2000 year's Olympic Games. Why did Sydney get a [wd7,-2] upper hand over its strong rival Beijin? The most important reason is that Sydney declared that it would put the environment protection at the first, and held [vp9,s-] a "Green Olympics". This appealing idea stroke [wd3,s-] a fatal blow on Beijin [fm1,-]. So we can see that environment protection has already occupied a significant place in international affairs.  	Chinese government also pay [vp3,2-] much attention to environmental problems. A great ecological project is undergoing [vp1,1-2] in China, that is the "Green Great Wall" project. A green belt of trees is forming in northen [f,1,-] China. When it is completed, the Green Great Wall will protect the fertile land from desertification. So with the efforts of all countries and all peoples in the world, a green age will arrive some day.  	Although the world has a promising future, we are still facing many difficulties. In developed countries, people are doing well. But in developing countries, the environments are deteriorating. There are two reasons: Firstly, most people in developing [wd4,d] lack [vp1,s-] of education, thus they do not understand the importance of environment protection. Secondly, even when the developing countries have realized the problems, they have no [wd3,-2] enough money to support the protection of environment.  	So, to make a green world we need worldwide co-operation. I believe that, with the technical and finacial [fm1,-] aids from the advanced countries, the backward countries can also contribute a lot to the creation of the Green Age.  (t13-8)  	Today, the whole world is carrying on a "Green War" against the more and more serious pollution of our environment. It's [wd3,-2] main task is to protect the remain [wd2,1-1] forests and grassland and at the same time to reconstruct them.  	With the development of modern industry and agriculture, our living environment is facing danger. Modern industry creats [fm1,-] various kinds of pollution, such as wast [fm1,-] water, refuse, noises and so on, while modern agriculture destructs [wd3,s-] [vp1,-s-] large quantity of grassland or forest into farmland, causing the erosion of soil. At the same time, the increasing large mumber [fm1,-] of population also creat [fm1,-] great [cc3,1-1] scale of dustbin [wd3,s-] and other pollutants. All these are suffering [cc3,-2] the nature, with the consequence of rivers polluted, fishes dead, greenland [fm2,-] disppearing [fm1,-] and animal [np6,1-1] starving.  	Pollution is also quite serious in China. The setting of high targets in the development of industry and agriculture, the starting up of small industrial and mining enterprises in a big way, the destruction of forests to reclaim land, the diking of lakes to make fields and fast growth of the national economy in 1980s [sn9,s-] all led to damage [wd2,s-] the ecology and pollution of the environment. Environment pollution directly impacts the harvest of agriculture. Thus it can directly have a bad effect on the life of our people.  	In the 18th Century, Victor Hugo said: "How sad it is to think that nature is calling out but the humanity refuses to pay dead." This words [np3,1-] is proved with the fact that the world is facing great trouble of pollution. Yes, perhaps mankind do not like to think about the evironment [fm1,-] when they are doing their industrial and agricultural construction. Only when the punishment from the nature comes can they realize the seriousness of it.  Think more about our evironment [fm1,-] ; think more about our future.  (t13-9)  	NATURE, this word as well as its various forms in other languages, will soon evoke [vp1,-s-] us a certain association of crystal blue sky and slowly-drifting white clouds under which, [sn9,s-] lie green mountains covered by big forest. Clean streams twist their way across rocks and stones, now and then there comes from someplace the melodious singing of unknown birds... We may find more accurate descriptions and praise in the poetic works of Keats, of Wordsworth, of Ezla Pound; in proses [fm1,-] of W.S. Mowen and in stories of Jack London, of E. Hemingway. With the vastness of seas and oceans, the holiness and pureness of snow-capped mountains, and the nice, bright colour and scent of flowers, nature shows us its magnificent beauty and strikes and enchants our minds.  	For millions of years since the cradle age of human beings, nature had been the great homeland for people, and the descendants of Adam and Eve never left it: they lived, worked and died in nature; they got their food and materials frome [fm1,-] nature; they enjoyed themselves in the beautiful scenery of nature... it's fabulous for us to think that humanity would live contented without such a kind mother of nature --- it's also the same to other lives on the earth. 	  	Nevertheless, nature began to sustain severe harm and damage, facing great challenges since [wd5,-3] 400 years ago. This intervention comes from nothing else but the destructions [np5,-] human beings have done to nature. Owing to the development of industrial civilization which started in 16th century, man commenced to damage nature, the enviroment [fm1,-] by large scale pollutions [np5,-] by insatiable denudations to the forest, by checkless [fm2,-] mining of natural resources... countless hectares of forests disappeared, countless hectares of arable lands desertified [fm2,-] countless rivers and lakes polluted [vp7,s-] ; no more clear sky, no more clean air, no more fresh water... nature's seriously hurted [fm2,-] nature's grooming [wd3,s-] nature's calling out for help. [sn9,s-] 	It was more than one and a half centuries ago that Victor Hugor [fm1,-] sighed with feelings: "How sad it is to think that nature's calling out but humanity refuses to pay heed." In a sense, Hugor [fm1,-] might be the first famous advocator of protecting nature and environment. But in that age when the modern industrial civilization saw its flowering, Hugor's [fm1,-] influence in this field was so insignificant, his voice was so week that they both sank into the oblivion of the hustle and bustle of the development.  	A hundred years elapsed. How about nature in [wd5,-1] nowadays? Population growth is far more [wd1,-1-3] swifter and violent than 100 years ago, the degree and scale of pollution is far more greater [aj3,1-] than 100 years ago, cities expand at high speed while nature shrinks quickly at the same time... In general, the situation has deteriorated, nature is facing fatal threats.  	Fortunately, not like their cold attitude in the last century, human beings have become aware of the calling, they've realized (and already found) what disastrous result their mistakes would bring to nature --- and finally, to themselves, they will never refuse to pay heed; Governments set apart environment protecting instituations [fm1,-] to control and treat with pollution and other destructions; a large number of nature reserves have been establish [vp9,2-] all over the world; the U.N. Environment Programme provides guides and helps in enviromental [fm1,-] protection field to all countries; many civil nature-protecting organizations have mushroomed and some of them, like the famous "Green-peace", play an important role in this work. A lot of people are making efforts to save our nature  	What has made for such a great shift? The danger and threat to humanity itself certainly is the main reason --- everyone understand [vp3,1-] that and it needs no more discussion. An other [fm2,1-] key point I want to talk about is: Humanity has found that their relationship with nature is integrate. They come to realize the importance of keeping a good nature, a good environment.  	In traditional Chinese culture, there is a philosophic conception: the integration of nature and humanity. That is, an idle state of an absolute harmony between nature and humanity. Nature is human beings's [fm2,-] nature, human beings are nature's human beings. In the deep part of everyone's soul there is a mysterious induction of nature, so that it's easy for us to understand why many a people leaves [vp3,3-] houses in noisy city [np6,2-] and found [vp6,s-] new homes in rural areas, why in holiday people are so eager to refresh themselves from business by spending time in scenery spots and resorts; or why the sensitive poets always sing songs for the beauty and greatness of nature.  	The slogan Backwards To Nature is gradually understood and accepted by more and more people, because they've come to realize that one who's made from earth should come back to earth, [sn9,s-] human beings came from nature, and they would come [vp1,-2] [vp6,s-] back nature.   Love nature as we do to ourselves [sn8,s] in humanity's name.  (t13-10)  	In the 19th century, Victor Hugo said: "How sad it is to think that nature is calling out but humanity refuses to pay heed." It reminds me of the tortured nature by the mighty Industrial Revolution. With the emergence of the steam locomotive, humanity entered a new era. The progress in science gave an impetus to the development of all the trades. But at the same time problems appeared. The most prominent was the destruction of nature. The development of industry unavoidably caused pollution. Large amount of waste water was discharged into the river, which used to be clear and teem with fish; the waste gas irritating the nose wantonly invaded the blue sky. The farmhouse was replaced by factories with chimneys emitting black smoke. People were content with the immediate interests and turned a deaf ear to the painful moan of nature. 	The painful moan doesn't stop nowadays. People simply pursue the economic interests and become more and more shortsighted. They cut the trees, which leads to soil erosion and desertification. They overtap [fm1,-] the natural resources to meet the rapid growth of industry, which gets them tightly encircled in energy crisis. More and more motorcars are produced, which speed on the highway, emitting large amounts of waste gas. People are too busy improving their life economically to pay attention to their environment. They don't realise that due to the discharged waste gas into the air, our globe has become warmer and warmer. The consequence will be disastrous. The iceburg [fm1,-] in the Antarctic will melt and in the end most parts of the earth will be submerged. In the game of torturing nature, farmers also take an active part. They use more and more chemical fertilizer in order to increase their output. The overuse of fertilizer has led to land degradation. It's really a tragedy that even farmers don't care for the land on which they depend for living. Apart from this, many farmlands [np5,-] are changed into non-agricultural lands. The ecological balance is broken. 	Nowadays nature has been changed beyond recognition. Some people wonder where nature is. It seems that nearly every part of nature has a touch of artificiality. Nature is moaning while people are stepping up to their intended abundance. People are blind to the rule that since they've destructed [wd3,s-] nature they have to pay for it. Let's have a look at the startling facts. Every year the flood and drought claim thousands of people's life [np6,3-] The desert invades farm land at an alarming speed. Our living environment is deteriorating. If people continue to torture nature, several years later, they will be surprised at the sight of the dead fish floating on the stinking river and the billowing smoke shrouding the blue sky. The idyllic life will only become beautiful memory. But fortunately, people began [vp6,s-] to settle down to think about what they have done to the nature. They become aware of the serious situation of their ecology, and begin consciously to build a beautiful future. They are moderate in demanding from nature. The awareness of ecology among people is enhanced and widespread education on the protection of ecology enables people to undertake the task. More and more people advocate [vp1,-s-] to return to nature and restore nature's original look. World-wide campaign [np6,1-1] for a cleaner nature is flourishing. Every year there is an Earth Day whose purpose is to inform people of the current situation of ecology and appeal to people's action to protect the ecology. However, despite these measures, the effect is unsatisfactory. People tend to first create a disaster and then try to remedy it, thus creating a vicious circle. It is just like drawing water with a bamboo basket --- all in vain. Large amount of money and manpower are wasted while the ecology is still deteriorating. 	The alarm has been raised. Now, nature is moaning, but if people don't pay enough attention to it, in the near future it will be the humanity who moan at the mercy of nature.  (t13-11)  	One excellence in the traditional Chinese culture is of significance even today. That is about the harmony of nature and humanity --- mankind is neither the master nor the slave of nature but its friend, and that the two should maintain a harmonious relationship for the good of each other. Yet the relationship between humanity and nature seems to be more intense while the society develops. In the 19th century, Victor Hugo said, "How sad it is to think that nature is calling out but humanity refuses to pay heed.: And it's still true even nowadays when the whole world enters into an unprecedented development.  	Now in the end of the 20th century, we enter upon [wd3,1-3] a new era of great change. The revolution of computer, the emerge [wd2,1-2] of nucleus, the breakthrough in the biological engineering, all these indicate the great progress that humanity has made in recent years. On [pp2,-2] one hand, it shows that humanity becomes more and more capable of solving all kinds of problems, of making the world serve ourselves better, [sn1,s-] yet on the other hand, it also cause [vp3,2-] a lot of new problems such as the environment pollution, the sharply increasing population especially in the developing countries, the unbalance of ecology. To better solve and prevent these kinds of problems, all of us should realize that humanity should remains [vp9,1-] harmonious with nature.  	Humanity live [vp3,1-] on the nature, and it's the nature that provides us with all the materials for a living. We gain everything from the nature for our development. In this aspect, we should pay much attention to the nature, or it will at last do harm to humanity in reverse. Even in modern society, this constant truth will apply. Take population as an example, ever since the end of World War II, many countries in Asia, Africa and South America gained independence. Yet most of these countries are poor and economically backward. Among their joyous cheer for their independence, a baby boom emerged and the population increased dramatically, even out of control. This stands in the way of the country's development and [sn1,s-] even worse, it brought [vp6,s-] some new and more severe problems to the country. For [wd1,s-] the natural resources in a country is [vp3,s-] limited and the overgrowing population will lead to overtapping [fm1,-] of the resources [sn9,s-] hence the degeneration of environment, the loss of ecological balance and other social problems such as crimes, shortage of house [np6,1-] followed [vp6,s-] the heel. How can you have the heart to hear that thousands of children are starving, or suffering from deseases [fm1,-] because of lack of food? Creating new life is one of the greatest career of humanity, yet even so humanity should follow the rule of nature, should be in harmony with the nature.  	Maybe the problem of overgrowing population does not exist in the advanced [wd5,-2] developed countries. They have enough capability to feed their people. Through advanced technology they make better use of their resources and also invent lots of new ways to better people's life. While the industrialization brings people abundant goods for consumption, the waste discharged by the factory are [vp3,s-] worsening our living environment. The waste gas discharged by thousands of cars going and coming, the noise of the cars, machine [np6,5-2] all make the city a terrible place to live in. While we are revelling in the advanced facility and enjoying the modern life, can we keep our brain clear enough to realize that the nature is calling out for us to protect the environment? If we fail to do so, we will be punished by the nature. 	Now more and more people come to be aware of those severe problems and make efforts to solve it [pr3,s-] Severe as they are, we should be confident that we can solve it [pr3,s-] as long as we pay enough attention to it [pr3,s-] As the traditional Chinese culture states, humanity and nature are friends, we are able to remain harmonous [fm1,-] with each other and should be.  (t13-12)  	The nature has kindly provided home for man from the very day when they [pr3,s-] exist. Men to the nature is son [np6,s-] to mother. For she endows men with pure water, fresh air, delicious food, colourful clothing, most of all, a beautiful and comfortable home. [sn2,s-] 	But what [wd4,s-] men repay for her gentleness? That [pr1,d] is tons and tons [wd4,2-2] waste piled in the open wild [wd2,2-] billowing smoke set out [cc3,3-] into the air and poisoned water drained into river [np6,1-2] or sea. So that [wd5,s-] the ecological environment has been damaged. Due to the excessive population and overdeveloped industrialization, things has [vp3,1-] been worsening in the last century.  	In the 19th century, Victor Hugo said "How sad it is to think that nature is calling out but humanity refuses to pay heed." We can't deny that until today there is [vp3,s-] still those [wd5,s-] people. They always think the nature is an endless resourse [fm1,-] and it can be bullied without any revenge. Actually, serious problems has [vp3,2-] been brought before human beings, such as high-decibel noise, coal-smoke smog, acid rain, soil erosion, salination-alkalinisation [fm1,-] and desertification, etc. But it's glad [wd3,-]to find out that more and more people throughout the world wake up at this warning.  	People come to realize ecological imbalance not only hinder [vp3,s-] the development of globle [fm1,-] economy, but threaten [vp3,s-] the existence of human beings. The future of mankind will be decided by present choice. Men may either blindly dig a grave for themselves or consciously build a beautiful future.  	Measures for improving the ecological environment has [vp3,s-] been put forward by governments. For example, birth control policy is introduced by many countries, esp [fm2,-] in the developing third world. Draw up a "Green Land Plan" to comprehensively and rationally develop and restore land resources. [sn2,s-] Conduct wide-spread coordinated technical research for a "resource-saving type" of development. [sn2,s-] Adjust the energy strategy, control the use of mineral fuel and raise their [pr3,s-] rate of effective use. [sn2,s-] And strengthen education on ecological environment among the whole people. [sn2,s-] 	However, most of all [wd7,s-] see that men can not, and must not follow the traditional road of "high utilisation of resources and high consumption level" and "first polluting and then tacking [wd7,4-] ". The only way we can take is "saving natural resources, promoting moderate consumption, paying attention to coordinated development, implementing overall adjustment and control, protecting the environment comprehensively and restoring the ecological balance."  (t13-13)  	The great revolution of the industrialization more than 200 years ago had brought uncountable disasters to Nature at the same time when it promoted the development of the human society. Man is destroying Nature and themselves [pr3,s-] while creating civilization. Even today, humanity seems to pay little attention to it after they've suffed [fm1,-] from a great deal of retaliations [np5,-] of Nature.  	Nowadays human survival are [vp3,3-] challenged by the various pollution, increase [wd4,1-4] population and ecological deficit. It is inevitable that where there is industry, there is pollution. More people means creating more pressure on, increasing more greedy need to Nature. Nature itself is not as perfect as God. It will be sick from time to time but the destruction of humanity will beat the ill guy to death until man disappeared [vp6,s-] in [wd3,-2] this planet. [wd7,s-] 	Some people may be cheated by the World Ecological and Development Summit held every year. Every time they seem to sight a gleam of light of fine human conscience, but every time they become disappointed. Nature is still the dying patient. The prescription of the politicians is only a dose of anaesthetic, which makes people dream a good dream in daytime. Let's fly from [wd4,1-2] east to [wd4,1-1] west, from [wd4,1-2] north to [wd4,1-1] south and have a full view of the destructed [wd3,s-] planet. Do you see the deforestation of rainforest, the desertification of fertile land, the destroy [wd2,1-3] of O3 zone, the erasion [wd3,1-2] of soil and the disappearing of rivers and the depletion of fresh water? Ecological problems are far from solving. Man is still exploiting Nature in exchange of economic profit. "Nature is calling out but man refuses to take heed."  	No matter how advanced the modern technology is, if people don't wake up from the dream of ignorance and cheating, their effort and hope will never have any result. Some advanced countries fully realize the harm of pollutions [np5,-] so they take some "good" measure to solve them. Nuclear waste is extremely dangerous so they smuggle it to the developing countries as so-called harmless industrial waste and damp [fm1,-] it into the sea. And some developing countries are willing to accept it for the sake of money but care for nothing about the health of those poor guys. It is correct that some countries pay [vp1,-s-] attention their own profit and safty [fm1,-] but they fufil [fm1,-] it at the expesen [fm1,-] of other countries' profit and safty [fm1,-] They protect part of [wd4,1-2] living space but they destroy [wd4,-3] other part of [wd4,-3] living space and even the whole Nature.  	If the whole human society really pay [vp3,s-] attention to the protection of Nature, I think, Nature will reward us generously. The civilization of human being [np6,s-] will enter into a new era only when Nature and human [np6,2-1] live in harmony as friends. I hope this day will come soon.  (t13-14)  	Victor Hugo said in the 19th century that how sad it is to think that nature is calling out but humanity refuses to pay heed. If he can live up to now, I think he would feel both gratified and worried. The thing which can be gratified [aj4,5-] is that people have payed [fm2,-] more and more attention to the problem of nature. But environmental problem still worries people for the situation is bad or even worse.  	The earth is home of human beings, and nature is our mother. Since man exists, the nature feeds us unremitting [wd2,s-] and asks no repay [wd2,2-] She provides forest to us, so we have wood to lit [vp5,1-] up and then have warth [fm1,-] and light; she provides river [np6,1-] and we have water to drink; she gives us animals and fruit to eat. She is unselfish. But people are never satisfied. They did "repay" to her, by cutting more and more forest and woods, by occupying more and more land, by making the water more and more dirty [aj3,1-] Her green gowtment [fm1,-] became raged [wd3,s-] for the lost [wd3,s-] of tress [fm1,-] ; [sn9,s-] Her beautiful face became rough for the desertification of the land; [sn9,s-] Her body become [vp6,d] dirty for the pollution of the river and air. The nature is calling out desperately. Even in the 19th century, Victor Hugo was able to hear her cry. But that's too little. People seldom pay attention to their sick mother. They still go on demanding [cc3,2-2] to her. Things will develop in the opposite direction when they become extreme. Soil erosion, salination-alkalinisation [fm1,-] and acid rain, all these are the consequence [np3,s-] of people's act. If we don't stop this, the vicious cycle will finally bring a big disaster to us.  	To our gratified [wd2,2-] people become aware of the situation they caused. Measures are taking [vp7,s-] to stop the deterioration of environment. New laws are made and carried out. New technique is used on this field. Large amount of money is spent in researching and buying equipments [np5,-] In China, environmental protection has become a national policy. We have taken measures like drawing up "Green Land Plan" to develop land resources; [sn9,s-] conducting wide-spread coordinated technical research for a "resource-saving type" of development. Adjust the energy strategy and increase the proportion of clean energy sources. [sn2,s-] The most importance step is giving widespread education to officials and the masses on the protection of the environment to enable the whole people to undertake the task.  	Although we start a little bit late, but [wd5,s-] if we keep on making our effort, I believe the future of mankind is beautiful.  (t13-15)  	In the vast cosmic [wd2,3-] human beings are lucky to have our richly endowed home --- the earth. For centuries, amid the fast developing space technology and astraunomy [fm1,-] scientists and astronauts have been exploring the outer space for other planets where our human race can immigrate into. However, they've found none of such planets and no other creatures with high intelligence either. Up to now, human race can survive only on the Earth and nowhere else. The Earth is our home, our only place to live.  	Humanity and nature are closely linked together and interacting every minute. Human race relies on nature for place to live and resources to tap. Nature becomes livly [fm1,-] and animate because of human activity and human creation. Human race is the momentum in this relation, yet nature has its counteraction on human race. When human activities go byond [fm1,-] rein and run wild, doing harm to the nature, nature will have its revenge on human race, sooner or later.  	In the ancient times, because of the primitive state of human activities, human [np6,s-] didn't change the nature dramatically, and they coexisted harmoniously. As science and technology develop, human's [np6,-1] ability to change nature strengthen [vp3,s-] More and more man-made objects have taken the place of natural ones, the earth is being transformed into a place which human being [np6,s-] hope it to be. This sounds great except that nature is often harshly dealt with. Being more and more powerful, human race tends to neglect the harmonious relation with nature. 	  	Nowadays, pollutions [np5,-] [cc3,-3] are ruthlessly discharged and damped [fm1,-] into the air, the river and the sea without much efforts to recycling [vp5,4-1] them. Deforestation happens everywhere in indensely [fm1,-] wooded areas. As a result, many clean and beautiful natural lakes, rivers and other water resources become undrinkable and stink, a lot of big cities have soot and dust in their air and among them comes a "smog city" --- London. Many [np8,-2] fertile land with beautiful forests have been reduced to barren hills and even desertified [fm2,-] land. One example is the loess high land in northwest China, which used to be covered with trees and was endowed with the name "the cradle of Chinese Culture", because of excessive deforestation in the beginning of this century, became barren [sn8,s-] --- of the 540,000 square kilometers of the highland, the eroded area has reached 90 percent, with much fertile topsoil washed away by the area's torrential rain.  	These signs appear as the callout by nature, yet most human beings have [wd4,s-] pay [vp9,1-1] much attention to them. They think that enviromental [fm1,-] protection and improvement are the task of environmental scientists' and governments. But the truth is the opposite. Environmental problem concerns everybody. Recently, some companies invented a new kind of patrol [fm1,-] without the lead element. This new patrol [wd3,s-] get [vp3,s-] rid of the poinonous [fm1,-] matal [fm1,-] element which once discharged into the enviroment [fm1,-] would pollute the air, the soil and water and do great harm to brain nerves and affect children especially. This is a good trial and attempt of combating pullotion [fm1,-] Yet many people don't bother to change to this new energy because of its a little bit higher price.  	Though individual [np3,s-] can from their part try to protect our surroundings, this difficult task rely [vp3,3-] mainly on all governments on earth. They have the duty to draft up environmental protection law and guard against their own actions which would harm the ecological balance. For example, the chemical compound Freon which are [vp3,s-] mainly used in refrigirators [fm1,-] as refrigerants, is reported to contribute to the fact that the ozone layer has a huge hole in it. The result is that rays from outerspace can enter our atmospheric layer without any absorption and will cause great trouble for [wd3,3-2] human race --- bring skin cancer and other health problems. However, many countries still stick to using Freon instead of looking for other substitute for it. Another example we can easily get is the nuclear weapons. The first military nuclear bom [fm1,-] exploded in August, 6, 1945 in the Japanese city of Hiroshima, it killed 75,000 and injured 61,000. Apart from direct influence on human lives, it has great polluting power to our environment. It's [wd3,s-] fallout is absorbed by earth, plants [sn9,s-] animals and human beings, the effects of nature will last for years while the harm done to human bodies can be handed down to the coming generations. However, some governments, thinking only their security and status in all world forces, continue to research and build neclear [fm1,-] fercilities [fm1,-] for military purpose [np6,2-]  	The 19th century scholar Victor Hugo said, "How sad it is to think that nature is calling out but humanity refuses to pay heed." I'm sad [wd3,s-] to say that the situation has been improved greatly and the conscious must do our [pr1,4-] best to ring the alarm to the world. We must keep one thing in our mind: humanity and nature must keep a harmonious relation. That's where the welfare of all human race lies. Let's work for this goal!  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH ZD> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (t13-1)  	In the ninteenth [fm1,-] centry [fm1,-] Victor Hugo said "How sad it is to think that nature is calling out but humanities [cc2,-1] refuse to pay heed." This expression still has its significance nowadsys [fm1,-] to some extent, it is more serious and urgent than a centry [fm1,-] ago. Although humanity has begun to realize how gaim [fm1,-] the result of damaging environment is, they can't rein in [wd3,1-] or some people still refuse to pay [vp2,-2] attention for their own benefit. Nature is not only calling out today, it begins to punish humanity's selfishness and ignorance.  	A Japanese man who used to be an invader half a centry [fm1,-] ago visited China again in 80's. After going to the Changjiang River, he sighed, "Half a centry [fm1,-] ago, I came here as an invader, the spectacle was so beautiful, but now I come here as a tourist, the water is dirty and the spectacle is gone. What a pity." That's a true miniature of the whole country, and the world. Humanity surely have [vp3,2-] tried to protect the ecological environment. Laws of environments were passed and carried out in many countries, various organizations were set up on the purpose of protecting the balance of nature. But it is difficult and a little late. Long-term damage made humans involved in the vicious circle, because of which, one inch people forward [cc3,3-] on the way of protecting the earth, one foot it gets worse [cc3,4-] Furthermore, increasing population inhabits in [wd3,-3] this limited planet, and thousands of factories and building [np3,4-] are established to meet the staggering demand of people's lodging and food. Even it is not out of human's [np6,s-] intention, the fact is the sick earth is being squeezed to feed more and more lives.  	What is worse than not being able to stop damaging is not willing to. While countless people worried [vp6,s-] about and work hard on [pp1,-]protecting the ecology, some persons still continue to do harm to the environment for their benefit. The discharge of polluted water, air, the pollution of the rivers, seas etc, many of them are not caused by people who have no money. To those rich businessmen, suffering from pollution is faraway and worth little attention. If the atmosphere in this area is polluted, money can afford them to breathe the fresh air in another place. So they can't see the benefit [np1,-s-] to invest in the system of clarity [wd7,3-] Maybe it is not popular to most businessmen in the world, but it is, in China.  	Although it is a long way to save and cure the environment, and maybe humans are desitined [fm1,-] to be defeated by angry nature[cc4,1-], humanities [wd3,s-] still have to try, because this is the unique earth.  (t13-2)  	In the 19th century, Vicor [fm1,-] Hugo said: "How sad it is to think that nature is calling out but humanity refuses to pay heed." In big cities, various factories were built up and the population was growing rapidly. People seemed to enjoy the "comfortable" life which was due to the Industry Revolutions, not considering noise and air pollution and [wd4,-s-] potential effect on human beings and the earth.  	With several disasters such as diseases, droughts, floods, desertization [fm2,-], directly or indirectly caused by ecological imbalance or environmental pollution, people nowadays are awaring [wd2,1-] of the importance of nature. They hold demonstrations all over the world to call for environmental protection, telling people how to save energy and materal [fm1,-] in daily life. gas [fm3,s-] containing lead is forbidden [cc3,4-] to use in the cars in many countries and Hongkong [fm2,-] encourages people to burn non-lead-containing [fm2,-] gas. Governments of many countries have set laws on controling pollutions [np5,-] which have reached the point of endangering the existence of human beings. Thus, in some places, pollution is under control now. London is a good example in getting rid of its smog.  	In spite of the success of movement in daily life, people neglect the most contributing element [cc4,1-] in destroying the nature. That is pollutant from big factories and even from some state-run elemental factories or facilities. According to the report of scientist [np6,3-] there is [vp6,s-] a little hole in the atmosphere above the South Pole several years ago. All contries [fm1,-] called for precautions to mend [vp1,-3] up the sky. If they had done as much as what they had responsed [fm2,-] at the news, the hole had been mended up. However, it is becoming bigger in recent years. If it is not the lack of real precautions, what shall we blame?  	Since people have paid attention to the call of nature, why not take effective caution [cc4,1-] to prevent it from destruction? Why do people just call for action but waiting [vp4,s-] [vp1,-4] others to do it? How can people allow the polluting factories to go on destroying the nature? Between the products made by such factories and environment protection, what shall they choose?  (t13-3)  	Patches of forests are disappearing, many kinds of animals are on the edge of extinction, the world becomes warmer and warmer and the deserts are enlarging. The environment human beings live in is worsening, but how much we [wd1,s-] have done to rescue it? The answer is --- little.  	In 19th century, Victor Hugo had noticed this problem and called [vp1,-6] on to people's attention to it. Human beings have extracted innumerous materials from the nature to develope [fm1,-] themselves and have done little to keep balance with the nature. They have destroyed a large amount of frosts [wd3,s-] which plays an important role in cleasing [fm1,-] the air, storing the water and supplying homes for wild animals without which our dull life will be less interesting. In Shanxi Province in Northwest China, the peasents [fm1,-] have deforested most areas to plant crops, [sn6,-s-] but because the trees are gone and the earth and water can not be kept in the former place anymore, it is impossible for the crops to grow. In Africa, people also have damaged nature greatly. Many lands [sn8,-s-] once had been very rich have turned to be endless deserts now. Although the enviroment [fm1,-] is getting worse, they still have a high birth rate, taking no methods to stop population explosion but turn [vp4,s-] to nature for more food. Every day, innumerous cars and factories give out astonishing amount of poisoned and wasted [wd3,s-] gas, which are [vp3,s-] harmful to people's health and pollute [vp3,s-] nature badly.  	Human nature [cc2,1-2] only know [vp1,-s-] to gain more to enjoy their lives better, only know [vp1,-s-] to ask nature for more materials and are unwilling to repay nature a bit although nature has showed many signs to warn them. Their greediness surely will be punished by nature. It is only a problem of time. The famines, floods and drought are just the beginning of its revenge. If humans still pay no attension [fm1,-] to its warning, it is possible that they could disappear from this world very soon.  (t13-4)  	It is said that nature is calling out but humanily [fm1,-] refuses to pay attention. This is partly true. Nowadays although we still face a lot of destructive activities towards nature from humanity such as pollution, deforestation etc [wd5,4-] we also notice that more and more people are calling out for attention to protect our planet from deteriorating, and quite a few countries have begun to take some measures to make the situation better.  	It is true that our planet is confronting such serious problems as population explosion, pollution, expansion of deserts, deterioration of climate which are caused by careless treatments from human beings. And it is sad to see that there are still lots of people and nations unaware of the seriousness of this situation, especially in developing countries. In those countries, because of the lack of strict laws to prevent people from deforesting, hunting and killing rare animals and giving birth and because of people's unawareness of the importance to protect the environment in which they live, they take what they want for a living or for making money but take no measure to keep the balance of nature. Therefore, unavoidably, nature is being ruined and changing for worse.  	But in some developped [fm2,-] countries, nature is getting better attendance. Season for hunting is limited; societies calling for protection of nature are set up; better arrangement is taken into consideration when some constructions are carried out; and lots of cities are covered with trees. Humanity does pay attention to the call of nature.  	Maybe some one will ask: why the developping [fm2,-] countries cannot treasure nature as well as the developped [fm2,-] ones? This is because they have to depend more on nature for food, fuel and housing. But if when [wd5,s-] they can live better even without having to take much from nature, they will do the same as those in the developped [fm2,-] countries to save our planet from dying.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH SJD> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (t13-1)  	The 19th century French writer Victor Hugo once said, "How sad it is to think that nature is calling out but humanity refuses to pay heed." Indeed. And how much sadder it is to think that Hugo's words are not paid much attention to by us, people of the 20th century!  	For [wd5,1-4] in the 20th century, humanity still turn [vp3,2-] a deaf ear to the groans and yells of nature.  	The nineteenth century was one of prosperity for the industrialized world and one of disaster for Nature. Heavy smokes swarmed out of factory chimneys and polluted the air, and great noises aroused Nature from her peaceful sleep. For the first time in history, Nature, mother of human race, felt pains caused by her child's [np6,s-] selfish action. But, as said by Hugo[sn8,s], no one cared about her.  	Things have been getting only worse nowadays as far as I see it. Industrialization is sweeping the world and more and more factories are being built. As a result, pollution is as rampant as ever and Nature feels so in front of it. Rain forests are retreating before axes and electric saws; rivers and lakes find themselves having to swallow various poisons; sea water is often suffocated by a film of oil caused by leaks of oil tanks. Everywhere on the Earth, Nature is being maimed and poisoned, its groans lost in a sea of chants from thousands of triumphant machines, while we are enjoying ourselves and just have no time to listen to Nature's pleading.  	However, Nature has not given in. Right now she is taking a revenge on us for her "inhuman" treatment; she is rebelling against her children. Among other things, we find it hard to get any more clean water. We have begun to feel the pinch.  	And that was why the presidents of most our countries [cc4,2-] had an environment conference in 1993, at almost the end of the century --- we had found ourselves on verge of self-destruction. It was only then did we realize our foolishness.  	So, hopefully the next century will see ourselves reconciled with Nature. Let's lend an ear to our mother's complaints and remind ourselves "stop torturing our Nature!"  (t13-2)  	I think what Victor Hugo said in the 19th century is still true nowadays. First, let's look at the wars in former Yogoslavia [fm1,-] and other areas. Because of the war, large areas of farmland are wasted. This is followed by famine. People there have hardly anything to eat, not to mention sanitation and disease-control. So nature responds by hunger and epidemics. However the warlords refuse to heed the warnings of nature. They continue to fight for their own interests, caring nothing for the life of ordinary people. So the war must be stopped at once. All the just people must rise to overthrow the warlords. Let us live peacefully together. War means the doom of mankind. Peace means prosperity and future.  	Second, let's examine the world's greenhouse effect. Nuclear explosions throughout the world, continuous emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere caused by the burning of fossil fuels and other materials bring about the depletion of [wd4,1-2] ozone layer. Nature is calling out: the rising of temperature, extreme cold, more earthquakes and the gradual melting of the Antactica [fm1,-] But people won't pay heed. They continue to do things at will. More nuclear explosions, inefficient use of burning fuels and so on [sn2,s-] In my opinion, all the unclear [wd3,1-2] explosions must come to an end right away. Emission of carbon dioxide must be checked. Otherwise we will face intolerable heat and cold, more earthquakes and world-wide floods.  	Third, some people in the world have bad moral behavior. They use drugs, have sexual misconduct. Nature responds by Aids and other horrible diseases. But they won't heed. I think they must wake up immediately. They must know that the consequences of their misconduct are very serious. Millions of people have already suffered the disease Aids. Effective cures are yet to be discovered. So at present, all we must do is get rid of drugs (this, of course doesn't include the drugs in curing diseases) and behave properly, so that we can control Aids and other terrible diseases.  (t13-3)  	Some people claim that with the arrival of science, technology and industrialisation, the world we live in is no longer what it used to be: the pristine state of nature decorated by the beautiful colours of nature and the melodious sounds of nature --- blue skies, green land, clean water, drizzle and breeze. It was the romantic state of the world capable of intoxicating people and inspiring imagination. But now what comes into view in every industrialised region is a jungle of concrete skyscrapers, the snaking and interwoven network of motorways, crowded traffic and rushing people on the streets. The polluted air and water, and unbearable noise [sn2,s-] With such a big contrast, they conclude that the world is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination, and this trend of industrialisation must be checked if we are to live harmoniously with nature.  	We do not have to put industrialisation and preservation in the opposite positions. I do not think that industrialisation will necessarily deprive us of imagination and dreaming. On the contrary, science and technology can help us to build a better world for us to live in. They are not inherently contradictory.  	It is true that science, technology and industrialisation has brought some side-effects to modern society, and this, I believe, is not because of science and technology itself, but because of the misuse of science and technology by people who have done so out of selfish motives or who are near- sighted. In modern human history, science and technology has brought about far more advantages than disadvantages. Thanks to science and technology, human being [np6,1-2] has been liberated both physically and mentally. Machinery of all kinds and of all different purposes extends the physical power of human beings and computer science and technology serves as the extension of human mental power, which has greatly increased the efficiency of human work. People, more than ever before, have more leisure to enjoy [cc3,4-1] themselves, [sn9,s-] traveling, participating in sports or doing something creative just for pleasure. Science and technology is capable of making people live meaningfully and comfortably.  	However, we must not overlook the side-effects of industrialisation. As is known, more and more realise the relationship between industrialisation and preservation of human environment, and measures have been taken to make a [wd5,1-2] proper use of science and technology so that people not only can enjoy the benefits created by science and technology, but also the precious gifts donated by Nature.  (t13-4)  	People nowadays seem to be living in a world of machines. At home we use all kinds of machines to take our place to do the house work, and at the office we press buttons to produce machines that will meet our needs. And people themselves live like walking machines. They eat the same kind of food that come out from factories, they dress the same clothes [cc3,2-] they drive cars instead of using their legs to go about, they live in buildings which are like matchboxes, they.... [sn1,s-] It simply appears that human beings have been materialized [cc3,5-] and have lost their life [np3,1-] and leaving [vp5,s-] no place for dream and imagination? [sn9,s-] 	Is it really so? Is it [wd4,s-] that the descendents of the people who lived on the Olympus Mountains and pictured so imaginative [wd4,2-2] life of the Gods [fm3,1-] could not dream any longer? Is it [wd4,s-] that the descendents of the people who built the Great Pyramid could not imagine anything now? Is it [wd4,s-] that the descendents of the people who constructed the thrilling wonder, the Great Wall, could not creat [fm1,-] a beautiful and lively life for themselves? People could not help [vp1,-1] to question it.  People have never stopped to dream [vp5,2-] and to imagine [vp5,s-] As long as the [fm1,-] live they will nurture their heart with cosy dreams and their head with fantastic imaginations. These two power [np3,2-] are deeply rooted in the human body and live along with the human being. It is this power that enable [vp3,5-] people to survive the harsh environment and extends the life of human being [np6,2-2] for tens of thousands of years, and it is this power that drived [fm2,-] the people to build such marvelous [fm1,-] civilization on the earth, and it is power that makes the world become [wd5,-] colourful, so animated and so worthful [wd3,-] to live for a second of time [cc1,2-]  	So under the cold surface of machine [np6,1-] actually the heart is beating. There is no need to worry about it.  	On the other hand, the science and technology and the product of the human being [sn2,s-] They are closely controlled by human being [np6,2-] The desire to survive for the whole of the human society [wd1,s-] will lead people to control the industrilization [fm1,-] before it's too late. And people will never wait passively to be destroyed by the material world they have created.  	The civilization are [vp3,2-] the basis for human being [np6,2-] to creat [fm1,-] [wd4,2-4] more comfortable world not hindrence [fm2,-] for their dreams and imaginations [wd7,s-]  (t13-5)  	A century ago, Victor Hugo, the great French writer said: "How sad it is to think that nature is calling out but humanity refuses to pay heed." A hundred years have passed, the world has changed greatly. But when I read this, it still sounds quite true to me. Never will I forget an incident that happened to me several years ago.  	In 1987, I was studying at a university in a big city in the North. One winter Sunday, I got up later than usual. Opening the window, I found that it had snowed during the night. I put on my coat and went out for a walk. The air was fresh. And the campus was all white with snow. The birds were singing in the woods and some children were snow-fighting on the play-ground. How lovely the world was, I thought. I walked out of the gate to the street. Turning a corner, I saw a large crowd of people. I walked to the crowd to see what was happening. I saw an old woman sitting on her bag. From the on-lookers [np4,2-1] talking I learned that she came from the countryside to see her son. When she got off the train she found that she had lost her money and her son's address. Not knowing what to do, she just sat there and waited. She was about fity [fm1,-] and in old clothes. How sad and helpless she looked! I felt pity for her. I might help her. Just as I was about to talk to her, I saw that so many people were watching her indifferently. I shrank. I was afraid of being laughed at. On the second thought [pp2,3-] perhaps I was asking for trouble. I turned back and went away.  	So many years have passed, I can't forget that sad and helpless face. I don't know what happened to her that day. I regret that I did not help her. Sometimes I thought that I was a coward and that crowd were [vp3,1-] cruel and merciless people.  	From that day, I began to hate snow. How pure, how clean the snow is! But it covers up too many evils. The world does not appear to be the true one when it is covered with snow. Under the pure, white snow, there are still crime, famine and war.  	However, human beings are making progress in both sciences and morality. People are joining [cc3,-1] efforts to eradicate these evils from the world and there will be greater improvements in this world. I believe some day in the future, the world will be pure, clean and beautiful as snow.  (t13-6)  	In the 19th century, Victor Hugo said: "How sad it is to think that nature is calling out but humanity refuses to pay heed." What about things nowadays? Nature has been crying for years, while some people pay heed volunteerly [fm2,-] or reluctently [fm1,-] some are still dormant.  	Nowadays every country and every region are eager to develop their economy. The fundmental [fm1,-] ways of economic development is [vp3,6-] to make progress in science, technology and industrialisation without sacrifying [fm1,-] the enviroment [fm1,-] In fact this principle has been ignored because of the urgency of the economical development.  	It is true that development is one of [wd4,2-1] themes in the world, but we should realise that nature is the resource of our survival, [sn9,s-] and development, [sn9,s-] we will be, in fact have been, punished by nature if we refuse to pay attention to it. Some people want to achieve [wd4,1-2] so called "high" profit, "high" speed, they try to expoil [fm1,-] the natural resource [np6,2-] only for their current benefit. They only think of today, not tomorrow. Only themselves, not others [sn9,s-] They are near-sighted indeed.  	Nature is [wd4,2-2] mother of human being [np6,2-] It is nature that offers us food, water, fresh air, sunshine and so on. We can get benefits from nature, but it doesn't mean that we can treat nature regardless of any natural principles. Through history studying we can see many natural punishment [np6,2-] on human being [np6,2-] for example, flood, forest fire, invasion of desert. There is an old Chinese saying: [sn9,-1] that is, to get all [wd4,1-1] water out of a pool for fish [sn2,-s-] Sure, you can get some fish for [pp2,-2] time being. Have you thought about what to get after that? Well, you have to starve and starve to death.  	Some people in the world are active in the environmental improvement. They are those who not noly [fm1,-] know the problem, but also devote themselves in [wd3,2-2] solving it ernerstly [fm1,-]  	Enviromental [fm1,-] problems are the problems belonging to the whole world. Every country and region should pay attention to them and work together against them. Many country [np3,1-] should properly deal with the contradication [fm1,-] of enviroment [fm1,-] improvement and the economical development, and make these two factors stimulate each other. To solve these problem [np3,1-] coporation [fm1,-] should be reinforced among countries in the world. Advanced countries should help the developing countries in science and technology, [wd4,s-] finance to cope with the enviromental [fm1,-] problems. With these [pr1,s-] the developing countries can really confront [vp1,-2] with them and solve them more efficiently.  	For those who are still ignorant of the enviromental [fm1,-] problems, enlightenment and education is [vp3,3-] crucial. Every government has obligation [np6,1-1] to educate them and make them know the seriousness of these problems.  	For those who know the problems and still refuse to pay heed, regulations and law are efficient ways to make [vp1,-5] them not to make profits by violating rules.  	Finally I'd like to emphasize [vp1,-2] on the importance of nature to human being [np6,2-] once more. Eviromental [fm1,-] problem [np6,1-1] is one of the biggest problems, [sn9,s-] everyone should love nature as he loves his mother. Now there are some problems in nature just as there is some tird [fm1,-] on our mother, [sn9,s-] take care of her, and wash her clean, and make her strong enough to live with us!  (t13-7)  	Nowadays it is very necessary for us to pay more attention to Nature, particularly Natural protection and pollution. It is in fact, many decades ago [wd7,s-] We seldom came acrros [fm1,-] the word. Nature problem [np6,1-2] on [wd3,-1] newspapers, broadcasting etc [sn2,s-] but [fm3,s-] now Everyday [fm3,1-2] you can see and listen to the news about the protection and pollution of Nature. I think heeding Nature is a society problem. We must pay more attention to it like 19th century's Victor Hugo.  	With the development of society, more factories are built up and industry have [vp3,1-] made a [wd5,1-2] great progress, all aspects of society have also achieved [cc3,6-]successfully [wd7,s-] The levels of the people's lives have greatly improved, but at the same time, Natural [fm3,1-] pollution also are [vp3,2-] becoming worse and worse. Many factories poured [vp6,d] out waste things into the rivers and seas. In factory areas and big cities, poisonous gases such as carbon dioxide, [sn9,s-] came [vp4,s-] from the factories or [wd4,-s-] internal cambustion [fm1,-] engine of the cars and trucks etc. are constantly sent out into the air. So many rivers and seas and some air are polluted. In Mountain Areas [fm3,s-] many farmers have cut down forests [cc3,2-] [sn1,s-] when the flood is coming, the [wd5,-3] mountain slides accured [fm1,-] [vp6,s-] friquently [fm1,-] This brough [fm1,-] [vp6,d] many [np8,-1] distruction [fm1,-] to the farmers in all ways. and [fm3,s-] what is more [sn2,s-] As [cj1,s-] the reduction of the forests, the soil erosion also become [vp3,s-] fast. Natural balance have [vp3,2-] been destroyed. Many rear [fm1,s-] animals and plants have died away. all the facts above are very fital [fm1,-] to our life, our constrution [fm1,-] our science and technology and even our planet. So we must protect the nature scientific [wd2,s-] and make good use of it.  	I also would like to mention the land pollution and destruction. Many people have no sanitany [fm1,-] manner [cc1,1-] [sn9,s-] they often throw out waste things and the land [wd7,s-] [sn9,s-] particularly in some cities you can see many [np8,-1] waste and bad food and fruit coverings littered out [wd3,s-] in Every [fm3,1-1] direction, and what is more, these cities are very crowd [wd2,2-] Some city dwellers may suffer from various strange diseases because of the bad living conditions. Particularly in summer, if we don't heed the nature and pay more attention to the natural pollution we mankind may eleminate [fm1,-] [vp7,s-] one day.  	For [wd4,1-3] protection of nature [sn2,s-] For our future [sn2,s-] Something mus [fm1,-] be taken [wd3,s-] to protect and heed the nature[cc3,2-]. Now many contries' [fm1,-] goverment [fm1,-] have made all kinds of laws to protect the nature, [sn9,s-] through the TV. [sn9,s-] Broadcasting and other ways. [sn9,s-] the idea of natural protection has come into many people's minds, so we can say the world now are fighting against pollution, at the same time man also protects and uses the nature in [wd3,s-] scientific mothods [fm1,-] People also try their best to reduce the pollution resourses [fm1,-] and many have trained their sanitory [fm1,-] manners. So the idea of Victor Hugo to [pp1,-1] nature is very important to morden [fm1,-] people. I think Everybody [fm3,2-2] can understand this point and make a contribution in [wd3,3-4] the protection of nature.  (t13-8)  	In the 19th century, Victor Hugo had [vp6,s-] said: "How sad it is to think that nature is calling out but humanity refuses to pay heed," which shows Hugo's anxiety and worry towards people's blind action to explore nature. Since the industry [wd2,2-1] revolution, in order to make greater profit, modern man broke the harmonious relationship with nature, and seek [vp6,s-] wealth at [wd4,1-3] cost of nature. They ignored the call of nature and the enviroment [fm1,-] protection, desoultorily [fm1,-] cutting down trees, giving off poinous [fm1,-] gases and charging waste water into clean rivers. Nature had sadly witnessed [vp6,d] human beings' ignorant and cruel behaviors, but now she begins to revenge herself on their 20th's [wd4,s-] descendents.  	Nowadays the enviroment [fm1,-] problem becomes very serious. The coverage of forest in the world is reducing [vp7,-] rapidly, [sn1,s-] a lot of earth are [vp3,4-] being washed away, [sn1,s-s-] many acres of original fertile soil are [vp3,1-] becoming desert [np6,-] [sn1,s-s-] acid rain, air pollution appear in many places. We are losing our living space.  	Fortunately, people finally awares [wd2,2-2] the importance of enviroment [fm1,-] protection. Nowadays, throughout the world, many institutions and organs are founded to charge [cc3,-2] the enviroment [fm1,-] problems. Factories begin to employ the anti- pollution devices, [sn1,s-] farmers are encouraged to use scientific method [np6,-] to farm, [sn1,s-] the blind behaviour of cutting down forest is forbidden, [sn1,s-] enviroment [fm1,-] protection are [vp3,2-] widely publicized and from primary school [np6,2-] [wd4,s-] children begin to receive the enviroment [fm1,-] education and every citizen is encouraged to plant trees to make the country green. In a word, the people in [wd4,1-2] 20th century are trying their best to explore natural resources reasonably and protect their living surrounding [np6,-] Although the phenomenon of blindly destroying nature still exists in some areas [sn2,s-] We can safely believe with the efforts of the people all over the world, we will surely renew our homonious [fm1,-] relationship with nature.  (t13-9)  	Victor Hugo, a French Writer who lived in the 19th century once said: "How sad it is to think that nature is calling out but humanity refuses to pay heed." What a wise and provident person Victor Hugo is! He could realize the important [wd2,2-1] of environmental protection. Can we be justified in paying no heed to keeping the balance of nature?  	Of course [sn2,s-] To keep the balance of nature, [sn9,s-] isn't equal to abandon [vp4,s-] [cc3,-1] ourselves on [wd3,s-] the mercy of nature. But we can't turn a blind eye to environmental degradation. Otherwise it will be We Who [fm3,s-] take the punishment.  	Forests, birds, water, land, [wd4,1-] sky, [wd4,1-1] Ocean and [wd4,2-1] sea are all our best friends. They can provide a favourable living condition, [sn9,s-] for us. if [fm3,s-] we utilize them properly [sn2,s-] But there are some problems we are often negligent of, [sn9,s-] in other words, many of us only take advantage of them, [sn9,s-] they [pr1,-]don't know or they are reluctant to protect them.  	In Brazil, Deforestation [fm3,s-] [sn9,s-] is. [sn9,s-] seen everywhere, [sn9,s-] Brazil. [sn9,s-] abounds with the world's largest. [sn9,s-] tropical forest. [sn9,s-] Zones [fm3,s-] Owing to people's overuse and damage. [sn2,s-] Now, Brazil's tropical forest. [sn9,s-] is on the sharp decline. As is patent to all. [sn2,s-] forest plays an important and necessary role in keeping the balance of nature. It can. [sn9,s-] provide [vp1,-3] us quality wood. [sn9,s-] and. [sn9,s-] beautify our environment. It can. [sn9,s-] also. [sn9,s-] shield. [sn9,s-] off the wind....  	In many developed countries and developing ones, Land [fm3,s-] is also worsening. In order to increase. [sn9,s-] grain production. Some countries. [sn9,s-] spray too. [sn9,s-] much poison and. [sn9,s-] fertilizer. [sn9,s-] into. [sn9,s-] the fields, which, in a sense, increases the grain production, but. [sn9,s-] in turn. [sn9,s-] does a lot of harm to land quality. From an overview point [cc1,1-] what they have done, [sn9,s-] does no good to nature.  	Rare. [sn9,s-] animals are being slaughtered. [sn9,s-] on a large scale. Giant Pandas [sn9,s-] leopards, whales, penguins and other rare animals are on the edge of extinction. This, in a way, steems [fm1,-] from. [sn9,s-] the environmental degradation. Many plants these animals live on. [sn9,s-] exist. [sn9,s-] no longer [wd1,s-] How can they remain alive. [sn9,s-] All the things in nature are interdependent.  	What should we do. [sn9,s-] in face of environmental. [sn9,s-] degradation? Can we continue to turn a deaf ear to worldwide deforestation. [sn9,s-] Vandalism. [sn9,s-] and degradation.? [sn9,s-] The answer is "No". What we should do at once, [sn9,s-] is we. [sn9,s-] should. [sn9,s-] bring home to people the importance of keeping the balance of nature, and also, we should set up. [sn9,s-] sanctuary. [sn9,s-] and take effective measures to give those people. [sn9,s-] who. [sn9,s-] don't protect the environment punitive punishments. Only by doing so can we. [sn9,s-] keep our. [sn9,s-] nature from being damaged. [sn9,s-] and contaminated.  	Some countries. [sn9,s-] such as Sweden. [sn9,s-] Switherland [fm1,-] and Singapore, have set good examples for us in. [sn9,s-] keeping the balance of nature. We should learn from them.  	In retrospect, Victor Hugo. [sn9,s-] could. [sn9,s-] urge us to. [sn9,s-] protect our environment. We should be guilty of what we have done to nature. The world is developing by leaps and bounds. China. [sn9,s-] is transitting [fm2,-] from. [sn9,s-] commodity economy [wd4,s-] market economy. On the one hand. [sn9,s-] we should. [sn9,s-] develop. [sn9,s-] our economy rapidly. On the other hand. [sn9,s-] we have full reason. [sn9,s-] to. [sn9,s-] pay heed to nature.  	Environment is our best friend. It is our best choice --- [sn9,s-] to protect the environment. [sn9,s-] to keep the balance of nature.  (P.S. environment and nature. [sn9,s-] in a general sense. [sn9,s-] refer to our surroundings).  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH ZD> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (t14-1)  	This is not true. Though there are still lots of ignorant [wd2,1-] [sn2,s-] People robbing and looting everywhere around the world regardless of laws legistated [fm1,-] to protect terrestrial environment, great effort has been made to preserve precious natural plants and animals, including those enviromental [fm1,-] protection organizations like Green Peace [wd7,s-]  	Everywhere, people are motivated, [sn8,-s-] are called to pay attention to this serious problem. Ristriction [fm1,-] [np6,-] are taken to ban the building of factories discharging poisonous wastes. Whoever that [wd5,1-1] lights a fire illegally will be fined severely. Soldiers are deployed in every Environmental Protection Zone, safeguarding rare plants and animals from looters. Childrens [fm2,-] are taught about what harm [wd4,s-] will do to them without pure air and clear sky. Natural zoos or parks are set up to remind everybody: please protect the nature.  	Not only countries, even individuals are devoted in [wd3,2-] this noble cause. Members of Green Peace Organization spread in every corner of the world. Wherever there are illegal or vicious actions corneriving [fm1,-] the benefit of ecology, they appear, argue and fight unremittingly. They won't be bribed, or threatened by force. Thanks to their couragious [fm1,-] perseverance, great amount of dolphins, whales, fishes are saved. Moreover, scientists are also permanent nature protectors. In order to gather some scientific data, they can endure the hardship of South Pole's icy cold, food rarity, powerful wind, vicious weather. All they want is to protect this holy area from any human pollution, to have a totally clean earth.  	Progress has been made though slow and hard [ad2,-] People have heard the nature's calling and have paid heed.  (t14-2)  	No place for dreaming and imagination in the modern world dominated by science [sn9,s-] technology and industralisation [fm1,-] ?! How ridiculous and absurdly [wd2,s-] this idea is! In my opinion, it is exactly the dream and imagination that help generate, develop, and perfect the world. In the past, while dreaming of flying in the sky as a bird, people created planes; while imagining travelling on and under the sea, people developed the industry of ships and submarines. Nowadays in modern [wd4,-]world, if someone has lost [vp1,-s-] in the concrete forest of the cities and [wd4,s-s-] the fast pace of the life [sn9,s] and claimed [vp6,s-] that there is no dreams any more, just ask him to turn his eyes on the large group of artists in the line of design!  	As mentioned above, a modern city is a forest of concrete huge [wd1,s-] buildings towering into the clouds. [wd4,-5] More prosperous a city is, [wd4,-s-] more shopping centres, nightclubs, hotels the city has. And from these very symbols of so-called "modernization and industralization [fm1,-] ", we can see the atmosphere of dreaming and imagination that the designer conveys to us. Once in Japan, I stepped into a glass tea-house and suddenly found myself in a "Fairy land under the sea". It was surrounded by water and there was a hole in the glass dome that took in the sunlight which was reflected by the water. This special and ingenious design endows the whole house with a mysterious but sacred atmosphere that can purify the soul and heart. And the ad of this tea-house says: "Transfuse light, wind, imagination and dream of..." --- The designer of this house obviously is a person full of imagination and he took great passion into this design to give a patch of land for more people to dream and imagine. Such examples can be seen everywhere aroud [fm1,-] us, no matter you see from the internal decoration or the external design of a building. That is why we say the construction is a piece of silent melody of the city, so if we pay more attention on [wd3,3-] the buildings we pass by when we hurry to work, we can find the trace of dream everywhere.  	Television is a product of modernization. Everyday when you turn on the TV, do you notice the trace of imagination in those ads? When watching the ad for "Marloboro [fm1,-] Country", do you see a dream of "coming back to nature" in it? When the scene of thousands of people coming together and consisting [vp1,-s-] a picture of smiling face [np6,s-] appears on the screen, do you feel the charm of imagination? To me, I can't help admiring the passion and the great imagination those ad-designers have!  	Dream and imagination make a significant part in mankind's history and life. They exist everywhere and every time. A person without dream and imagination is an animal and a world without them is simply a dead world. It is dream and imagination that bring out today's modern world of industralisation [fm1,-]  (t14-3)  	Nowadays our society develops rapidly, [sn1,-s-] our world are [vp3,2-] dominated by science [sn9,s-] technology and industrialisation, so some people say that we never need dreams and [wd3,3-] imagination. What they say sounds reasonable. In fact, in my opinion, we now need more dreams and imagination.  	Those people think we needn't [vp9,s-] dreams because everything existed [vp5,s-] can be proved by science way [cc1,1-] Reality is reality. We can not change it by dreaming. But they have made a large [cc4,1-1] mistake. A lot of science [wd4,3-1] technology came from imagination. For example, human being [np6,s-] can't fly. As far nobody can fly without any auxilary [fm1,-] equipments [np5,-] If all people think it is a fact that human being [np6,s-] never fly, we would just stay on the ground now. But actually there were some people who had been dreaming how [wd3,s-] we could fly. They made thousands of experiments, and most of them failed, even lost their own lives. But a few people succeeded. At first people used baloon [fm1,-] [np6,-] to fly, [sn1,s-] then Brother Whites invented a plane. Now our dream of flying in the sky come [vp6,s-] true.  	Nowadays our world are [vp3,3-] dominated by science [wd4,1-1] technology, but there're still some mysterious phenomena, which can not be explained by science [wd4,1-1] technology. Whether there is VFO [fm1,-] or not is a stormy discussion. So many people are dreaming about it. Like the dreams of how human being [np6,s-] fly, some are wrong. But among them there is a right one, and we explore according to it and get the answer. If we find that some creatures exist on the planet, the effect of the discovery is unimaginable.  	If there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination now, how dull our life is [vp6,s-] For example, in World Cup 94' [fm1,-] if all teams play [vp6,s-] according to what most people think [vp6,s-] thus [wd3,s-] no one would watch [vp6,s-] the match. In most people's opinion[wd1,3-], they imaged [wd2,s-] that team of Colombia would win and U.S.A's would lose. But the result was out of their imagination. And it is why soccer attracts people.  	So we need more dreams now. If we have dreams, we will live for the future. If we have dreams, our society will have more rapid progress. If we have dreams, our lives are various and colorful.  (t14-4)  	It is ridiculous to say that in our modern world, dominated by science [sn9,s-] technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. On the contrary, living in the modern world, we are more liable [aj1,3-s-] to dreaming and imagination because the more we know about the world, the more we want to know. With the help of science [wd4,1-1] technology, we have fulfilled many dreams. Dreaming of flying in [wd4,1-1] sky like a bird, we had airplane [np6,s-] Wondering what other planets [wd4,s-] like, we carried out [wd4,s-] Apollo moon-landing project. Promoted by dreams and imagination, we achieved [cc3,-5] great social and economic progress.  	However, the world is always changing. Science can't give us satisfactory explanation for every mysterious phenomenon. For example, does the UFO exist? Are there creatures living outside the earth? To find out the truth, we need imagination under the guidance of scientific experiment. Unbounded imagination helps us out of conventional ideas and leads us to unprecedent [fm1,-] notions.  	Life without fascinating dream [np6,2-] is dull and boring. Reality is full of difficulties, heavy workload exerts great pleasure on us. We may lose heart if we lack imgination [fm1,-] To dream and to imagine is part of our nature. Science [wd4,1-1] techology [fm1,-] and industralisation [fm1,-] can help us ture [fm1,-] the dreams true. But they will never limit our imagination.  (t14-5)  	Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science [sn9,s-] technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. They are mistaken [aaj1,1-2] saying so. Dreaming and imagination is [vp3,3-] always an illumination [wd3,s-s-] for [wd3,1-] the development of a society.  	Modern science [sn9,s-] technology and industrialisation were developed on the basis of dreaming and imagination. The dreaming [vp1,-s-] of our ancestors to add a pair of wings to the body and fly like a bird led to the invention of the wonderful machine, airplane. Many other inventions, such as the helicopter, the submarine, the wheels, etc., were all based on dreams and imaginations. The reason that imaginations can result in realization is that good dreaming and imagination is based on science or experiences and therefore not far from the truth. The rocket speed from the earth to the moon that Vernes imagined in his fiction was approximate to the actual speed, and the scenes of moon-walking and seabed-travelling he described were similar to the real scenes realized later. Therefore, if people keep experimenting on their dreams, they will often come true in the end. Thanks to this kind of imaginations, new products are invented one by one, which gradually improves the science [sn9,s-] technology and industrialisation.  	Likewhile [fm2,-] dreams and imaginations are still of great importance in modern society. As there is no end of learning, science and technology will develop at an even faster rate. When scientists get to know more about the world, the subjects grow more and more complex, some of which can't be seen by eyes. For example, atoms and even electrons can hardly be seen even by the most powerful microscope. Without imagination how could people know their existance [fm2,-] ? Further more [fm2,1-] since future can only be predicted through imagination, without it science could lead to nowhere and there would be no development of the society at all.  	In addition, even though dreaming and imagination can't always lead to scientific breakthroughs, it [pr3,d] can make the life colourful and meaningful. People can get happiness from the effort they make to realize their dreams as well as the sheer satisfaction in dreaming. Without dreaming, they would have to sink in a dull world.  	All in all, dreaming and imagination can never be eliminated. Instead, people should have more good dreams and imaginations and then try hard to realize them. Only in this way, can our modern world develop to a further degree.  (t14-6)  	Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science [sn9,s-] technology and industrialization, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. In my opinion, this view is only partly true. People today do care much about material interests, but appreciation for [wd3,1-s-] art, music, literature, those spiritual values [wd7,2-] still occupy [vp3,s-] part of people's lives.  	Human civilization can be divided into two parts: material civilization and spiritual civilization. Science and technology, as the most prominant [fm1,-] part of material civilization, has brought great benefit to human society, changing the world, improving people's living standards, and even penetrating into human mental world. Materialism, sense of competition, spirit of aggression, are new concepts that industrialization has produced in people's mind. The world is changing every day. To catch up with the steps of times, people have to get as much new information as they can, fulfil as much work as they can in a short time. Living rhythm is quickened. In big cities, we can see citizens rushing in all directions. To get success in careers, they have less time for dreaming and imagination. But that doesn't mean there is no longer a place for dreaming and imgaination [fm1,-] Cinemas, music hall [np6,1-] all kinds of relaxation facilities spread throughout the cities. And resorts with beautiful scenaries [fm1,-] attract numerous persons. People would like to relax at leisure. Nowadays less people are vary [wd7,s-] about art and literature, the fields for dreaming and imagination, but it still plays roles in the society, as one of [wd4,,2-5] necessary ingredients of happy life.  	Modern people still like to dream but their dreams are more related to the realistic life, and surely will push [vvp1,-5] the world develop more quickly.  (t14-7)  	With the development of science [sn9,s-] techonology [fm1,-] and industrialization, I believe that there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination which mostly base [vp7,s-] on ignorance. Those, for instance, who are still deeming that phanton [fm1,-] is the consequence of death would be regarded as moron [np3,s-]  	It can not be denied that science, technology and industrialization bring us more convinience [fm1,-] nevertheless, they are consuming our imagination simultaneously. To some standard [wd7,2-] it [wd4,s-] rather a bad [wd4,s-] than a good [wd4,s-] In the old days, children's most favorite entertainment is [vp6,s-] listening [vp1,-1] stories. Shuen Wu Kong, Ji Gong, [wd4,s-] eighteen Lou Hang (characters of Chinese folklore) occupied all our mind, and we all dreamed of meeting them or even shareing [fm2,-] their magic abilities. All those not only set us a target, but also made our life colourful. They played a really important role in educating us constructively, and let us ignore the hard-life we were going through in that certain period of time (Just after Chinese culture Revotion [fm1,-] ). Nowadays, all the phenomena are supposed to be explained by science. Many mysteries which could not be proved previously that caused [cc3,-2] people's imagination are now be [vp9,s-] discored [fm1,-] by modern techonology [fm1,-] The space for imagination is becoming narrower and narrower. In my eyes, modern techonology [fm1,-] and dream [np6,3-1] are born opponents. The more modern science you've learned, the less imaginative you would be, since science is based on fact instead of thought.  	So that [wd5,s-] it is a fact that facing [vp4] us, [sn9,s-] We have to deal with it sensibly. In my opinion, we can not totally abandon dream [np6,5-] because it can keep you from breaking down one day or another.  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH SJD> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (t14-1)  	Some people say that in our modern World dominated by science, technology and industrialization, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. It is true in some aspects in personal and social life. But, if this conclusion is considered carefully, one may see that this notion is quite partial. Actually, man is becoming more creative and imaginative than he was at any period of time in human history.  	Everything is not absolutely good or bad. What is the most important is how one can take advantage of its good side and try to avoid the other. Sometimes, man must take precaution [wd2,1-1] measures to prevent its side-effect from happening. In our modern world, science and technology are playing an important role in social life. Industrialization makes an [wd5,1-3] ever-increasing production possible. As science and technology are applied to industrial production, economy develops by leaps and bounds. The development of economy leads to the rise of people's living conditions. People no longer suffer from hunger so greatly, in the world as a whole, as they had experienced [vp6,s-] in the past. But, when people pay the greatest attention to the ever-increasing production instead of their over-all development, they are more or less confined by their own inventions, by science, technology and industrialization. If one sees only the confinement of man by his own invention and comes to the conclusion that there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination, he neglects the opportunities that science, technology and industrialization afford. In some factories, people seem to reduce themselves to slave [np3,3-] of their machine rather than make themselves master [np3,2-] of [wd4,1-1] machine. But, with the increase of the amount of social wealth, more and more people are liberated from these drugeries [np5,-] and devote themselves to creative work. Thus it can be said that human history is at a turning point. Another example: when [wd4,s-] robot is used, some kind of dull job [np6,1-] can be performed. This gives people more time for free thinking and creative thinking. But if one uses robot [np6,1-1] to be able to wait for anything [wd7,s-] he might be a victim of robot [np6,1-] All in all, the problem is how to use them.  	If some people still insist that the world is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination, reality may deal [cc3,1-3] a deadly blow upon them by showing more and more inventions coming into the light. Actually, if one looks back, he can realize that people as a whole are becoming more creative and imaginative, and he can see that invention process is quickening, in other words, science and technology are accelerating. It is no surprise to anyone that the modern age is an age of knowledge and information accelerating. It is no surprise to anyone that the modern age is an age of knowledge explosion accumulated through the years, [sn9,s-] it is no wonder that man has made explorations to the bottom of [wd4,1-1] ocean.  	The modern world is dominated by science, technology and industrialization. The dominance of science [sn9,s-] technology and industrialization over the world will make it a place full of dream [np6,1-2] and imagination.  (t14-2)  	I don't agree with this opinion. It is true that in our modern world, science, technology and industrialisation are playing [wd4,1-4] great [wd5,-2] important role in our life. You can find that science and technology are existing in almost every corner of our life. But we can conclude that because of this, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. From my point of view, the development of science and technology has provided us with more places for dreaming and imgination [fm1,-]  	In the course [wd4,2-2] the industrialization, with science and technology, people can get more knowledge from the world. People's mental ability is greatly improved. Also science and technology brought [vp6,d] to us [wd4,s-] prosperous life. People's living condition is far better than before. Both physical and spiritual life [np6,3-] become more and more plentiful [cc4,s-] and colorful. People were freed from worrying about their life. So people have more time and energy to dream and imagine, to construct the better life.  	Science and technology have enlarged people's view. Owing to science and technology, the world changed rapidly. The constant [wd2,1-2] changing world instruct [cc3,-3] more new ideas into human brains. Our sight to see [cc2,3-] the world is opened up. Only the modern people who were [vp6,s-] equipped with advanced knowledge of science and technology can have meaningful dream [np6,2-] and imagination.  	In our modern life, everyday many new things may come into our life. Our society is advancing rapidly. This is just the outcome of human dream [np6,2-] and imagination. People's living field is greated [fm1,-] extended.  	So I can say that science and technology didn't cease [vp6,s-] people's dreaming and imagination but enable people to have more ability to dream and imagine. On the other hand, people [np4,-4] dream and imagination would open the path for the development of science, techlogy [fm1,-] and industrialization.  (t14-3)  Science and technology is [vp3,3-] modernizing our society. Food science guides our choice between high-protin [fm1,-] food and low-protin [fm1,-] one; Chemistry [fm3,s-] on fabric features tells us what is the most comfortable and flexible material for our night-gowns; Architecture [fm3,s-] has the authority to comment on the sound-proofness [fm2,-] and the outlay [wd3,s-] of the rooms; Aeroplanes [wd3ms-] carry us from Beijing to Los Angeles, and subways take us from JinJiang Joyland to LongHua Station.  With the convinience [fm1,-] provided, life seems to be easy and the world seems to be uniformed. Millions of us go to the supermarket, pick up the canned food, crowd into the bus and make our way to the apartment lock, Wondering [fm3,s-] "which window is exactly mine" sheerly because of the similarity of the buildings and windows. That's just part of the story.  What's more miserable and dreadful is that our minds are becoming uniformed and refusing variety and novelty. Most of us are becoming lazier and lazier: we are accustomed to the set patterns, we are inclined to follow suit. In daily life, we just accept stereotypes and refuse to think on our own; In our work, we take routines for granted and give up questioning. Even in art and literature, priority is given to the popularity or the commercial benifit [fm1,-] of the artistic forms. Notice how plain the melody of the popular songs [wd4,s-] and yet how easy [wd4,s-] to learn to sing them; Almost [fm3,s-] everybody can imitate Li Ming, and Zhang Xueyou. notice [fm3,s-] the productivity of some minor authors in their "artistic creations." Almost every story is mould [vp9,2-2] out of the same plot. The space preserved for dreaming and imagination is becoming more and more limited and finite.  Yet, there is a law in Nature that everything cannot go too extreme. Our modernized world encourages uniformity in socialization, [sn9,s-] simultaneously, it lacks varieties created by dreaming and imagination. The world will turn into a machinized society unless its residents poccess [fm1,-] the power of imagination; We [sn9,s-] human beings will lose our power to create and change the world together with our value as human being [np6,2-] unless we try every chance to cultivate our imaginativeness and preserve enough space for our dreams.  In fact, there are a lot of people struggling for their freedom to dream and imagine; or, at least, they never stop their efforts in their pursuit of art and huminity [fm1,-] and never let go any chance when they can appreciate life itself. Hopefully, more and more people realize the importance of dreaming and imagination in such a modernized society like ours.  So we will still have places to dream and to imagine, provided we keep an eye on the problems occuring [fm2,-] and take ways to solve them.  (t14-4)  Different people have diferent [fm1,-] definitions of dreaming and imagination. Peasants dream and imagine [vp1,-2] to get in the plump-eared wheats [np5,2-] [sn1,s-] teachers dream [vp1,-2] to see their students' satisfactory grades, [sn1,s-] artists dream [vp1,-2] to live together with the beauties in their work, [sn1,s-] writers dream [vp1,-2] to cause a stir by their leading role of their articles. All these people have their own dreams and imaginations. Each kind of these people are crazy about the fruit of their labour, because the fruits are soaked with their sweat and bears [wd7,s-] and only by them their efforts are paid off [wd7,s-] Every one need have a place for dreaming and imagination. Each person likes to escape in [wd3,2-2] the place of their dreaming and imagination [wd7,s-] for only in this realm can he be what he like [vp3,1-] to be and do [vp3,5-] what he like [vp3,1-] to do. We often look out of the window for one or two hours, with a racing mind full of imagination, because it is the time to enjoy our endless dream or imagination and relax ourselves. In this wonderful time, dream [np6,-3] and imagination can stimulus [wd2,1-] our courage to face up [wd5,2-2] the reality, the mature ways to deal with the problems [wd7,s-]  Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longle [fm1,-] a place for dreaming and imagination. Maybe they feel too busy to spend time on dream [np6,1-] But in my opinion dreaming and imagination is [vp3,3-] our mentle [fm1,-] activities. So long as we have the pursuits in our life and cherish the hope, we will have the room for it in our heart. Science, technology and industrialisation won't take the place of it. How can they deprive [cc2,1-3] the right of imagine [wd2,1-] you are talking with an outer-space human of you [wd7,s-] ? How can they change your dream of being rewarded [vp1,2-2] [wd3,-1] Nobel prize because of your ways to cure cancer? The more advanced [wd2,s-] science and techonology [fm1,-] develops, the high [aj3,s-] your imagination and dream will fly [cc2,4-] In [wd4,1-2] primary [wd3,s-] society, I am sure No [fm3,s-] one had the imagination like "Superhuman". Just the high level of development of science makes our range of dreaming and imagination more wide [aj3,1-] [sn2,s-] For example, the means of transportation develops from donkey [np6,1-] carriage [np6,2-] coach [np6,3-] to car [np6,1-] train [np6,2-] plane [np6,3-] ship [np6,4-] even hovercraft [np6,5-] satellite [np6,7-] etc. If there had not been the invention of plane, there would have not [sn8,s-] the imagination of satellite. That is to say, science impels people's imagination, and imagination make [vp3,s-] science develop in a higher speed. The above-mentioned people's view on dream [np6,2-2] is harmful.  Value our modern life, value the comfort provided by science, technology and industrialisation, value our beautiful dream and imagination.  (t14-5)  	Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. According to my opinion, this idea is not proper. Whatever degree science, technology and industrialisation develop to, dreaming and imagination are needed for mankind and society. We can not give up this special gift, only if we want to develop this society and the world.  	From the development of the history of science, we can see that there is no progress of science and technology without dreaming and imagination. As we know, Gallineo [fm1,-], one of [wd4,1-3] Greek greatest scientists, ever concluded that two objects with different weights [np5,2-] will drop at the same speed and hit the ground at the same time, if there is no air to hold them back. Under the condition of that time, he couldn't do this experiment on vacane [fm1,-] or on the moon, therefore, Gallineo [fm1,-] had to repeat this experiment many times to prove [vp1,1-4] on the top of Pisa tower. With the development of science, people began to want to prove this conclusion on the moon. Nowadays, we know there is no air around the moon, but, do objects with different weights [np5,2-] really hit the ground at the same time from the same level? This curious idea inspired mankind to develop astronic [fm1,-] technology. At last, in the 1960's, Armstrong, one of [wd4,1-2] American astronauts proved this conclusion successfully on the moon. Dreaming and imagination can benefit the development of science and technology.  	Besides this, in our modern world, we still need dreaming and imagination, because the ability to recognize the nature and society for mankind is too limited. Today, although we had made [vp6,s-] great progress in science, technology and industrialisation, yet we still leave many unknown fields to discover. Depending on our present technical condition, [sn3,s-] it is not enough, [sn9,s-] we only dream and imagine the fortural [fm1,-] possibilities in some aspects of those fields. Then, under this inspiration of these new dreams and imaginations, we can try our best to realize them.  	Nowadays, mankind are [vp3,1-] trying to get to the [wd5,1-1] mars [fm3,2-] but according to present technology, it seems to be impossible. Just with the help of the curious imagination, science, technology and industrialisation can develop forward [cc5,1-] constantly.  (t14-6)  	Some people say that in our modern world dominated by science, technology and industrialization, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. This blind faith in technology must be eliminated immediately, or it will do great harm to our country, our people. Today dreaming and imagination are even more important than before, because we are making our country into a prosperous, modern country, so imagination and dreaming are necessary.  	In the mid-19th centry [fm1,-] when the United States of America was beginning to industrialize, many people thought it would bring them happiness, but no sooner had the industralization [fm1,-] gained its full momentum, some of them began to realize that technology was creating poverty and suffering as quickly as it was bringing wealth and affluence. A few men became rich, but many became poor. This is true of all the capitalist countries where there are [vp3,-s-] private owership [fm1,-] of means of production. For the workers has [vp3,2-] to be exploited and to work for their employer [sn2,s-]  	When profit is the only purpose of production [sn2,s-] Technology tends to depersonalize man [np6,1-] The employers want the workers to keep pace with machines and work as fast as they can. Thus the works [wd3,s-] are reduced to the status of the subordination of machines. Warm feelings and close human relation are made necessary [wd7,s-] and impossible. Creating and imagination are suppressed. Money rules over all the people.  	What is ever worse is that old and new imperalists [fm1,-] never hesitate to misuse technology. Athough [fm1,-] the memory of dropping two atom [wd2,1-1] bombs on Hiroshim and Nagaski is still fresh in people's mind a few imperalist [fm1,-] countries are still busy creating deadly weapons for human destruction.  	It is clear that technology along [wd3,s-] can't bring happiness. Technology is of course important. It doesn't mean everything to us. The use of it must obey the morality of the world so [sn9,1-] we can get the good it bring [vp3,1-] us.  (t14-7)  	Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialization, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. This is not true.  	Many inventions and discoveries made by human beings that change our living world and society sharply are at the very beginning dreams and imaginations. It is not uncommon to see that many important principles at first are foolish ideas to people to the day [wd7,s-] For example, ancient people saw bird [np6,1-1] flying in the sky and they wanted to fly just as bird [np6,1-1] did. They began to dream and imagine. But for their bold dreams and wild imagination, we would not see plane [np6,1-1] fly in the sky. Without Edison's seemingly wild dreams about electricity lamps, we would still live in the dark world.  	Though we move [vp6,s-] into an advanced society, we face a world dominated by science, technology and industrialization [wd4,s-] in want of dreams and imagination. Dreaming and imagination still holds an important role in our life. It is difficult to say what is impossible to our younger generation, for the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and reality of tomorrow. In 1969, when people saw moon-landing by live television broadcasting, they should know that moon- landing was a dream long time ago.  	Time can not be added to our life, we must make it longer by avoiding waste. Therefor [fm1,-] it is urgent and important to have some dreams and imagination, [sn9,s-] who knows, one day, one of your dreams or imagination will perhaps become an important discovery or invention that change [vp3,s-] [vp6,s-] the world greatly as Einstain's [fm1,-] "theory of relativity" did.  	We are living in a beautiful world full of wonders. We need dreaming and imagination. Otherwise, we can imagine [vp1,-s-] what a dull world [wd4,s-] lack of vividness and life, just a jungle of machines.  	I hate a world without dreaming and imagination. What about you?  (t14-8)  	It is true that science, technology and industrialization are playing very important roles in our modern world. But you can not say that there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. Dreaming and imagination are also playing very important roles in our modern world.  	A lot of science and technologies have come from dreaming and imagination. For example, the TV was a dream in the past, but now It [fm3,s-] has become an ordinary thing in every family. People had been imagined [vp7,s-] that they could walk on the surface of the moon, now people have visited the moon many times. And many ideas of science and technology have originated from dreaming and imagination. The development of science, technology and industrialisation would stop without dreaming and imagination.  	Dreaming and imagination have made our world more beautiful and various. Dreaming and imagination enable people to find more ideas about their lives, their buildings and dresses. Many cities have special building [np6,s-] which comes from dreaming and imagination. Dress-designers' imagination can make the clothes world more colourful and beautiful. Designers' imagination can make the Disney World much more fun [sn8,s] The world would be dull without imagination and dreaming.  	Dreaming and imagination enable people stay [vp4,2-] young. A [wd5,-3] people with dreaming and imagination whose life surely is hopeful and bright [sn2,s-] Because that [wd5,s-] there are hopes ahead of them [sn2,s-] A young heart is dreaming and imaginary [wd3,s-] Those hopeless people are without dreaming and imagination.  	Dreaming and imagination have been with people all the time. People had never forgot [vp6,s-] dreaming and imagination, because they need them and live with them.  	People had [vp6,s-] never forgot dreaming and imagination because they know that their dreams will come true some day.  	Let's dream for [wd3,1-4] a more beautiful world!  (t14-9)  	Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialization, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. But I can't say "yes" to this argument. I have a totally different view to this question. I think, modern sciences, technology and industrialization leave a large scope for people to dream and to imagine. They are the life-resourse [fm1,-] of the world.  	Actually, modern sciences enable us to have a closer and finer look at the world around us than ever. We can find more and more interesting, subtle and delicate aspects of the world when we lay eyes on the new things created by advanced technology. Everybody surely will agree that the world today is a great lot more colorful and prosperous than the world only a couple of years ago. People's living space as well as their imagining space has been expanded with the advance of science, industrilization [fm1,-] and technology.  	Modernization makes our society more sophisticate [wd2,4-2] than before. Not only does the concrete world appear to be fresh and brand new on every morning you awake from your dream, but also do [wd5,s-] the people around you take on a new look everyday [fm2,s-] just because a few things of novelty have kept exerting great influences on them. Without new things resulted [vp5,s-] from the progress of science, modern technology and roaring industrilization [fm1,-] the world would become dull and boring in a few years, because people soon get tired of the monotony of the old unchanging world.  	Our modern world will always remain to be the never dewindling [fm1,-] resources of arts, literature and anything that requires our imagination. People's life and their experiences in the struggle of building a modern world can really enrich our writers' minds. And modern techniques in public media like TV, MTV, Video, etc, greatly expanded the scope of arts, literature and films and brought life to some of the old-fashioned arts.  	To some extent, development of sciences and technology is in itself a [np7,-1] imagining and dreaming process. Sciences and industrilization [fm1,-] require people to probe further into the outer space and into the unknown world, which can only be exposed to us with the help of scientists' imagination. So, we may say, imagination is the twin-brother of modern sciences, technology and industrilization [fm1,-]  	Do you want to go back to the days when there is [vp6,s-] no TVs, no telephones, no movies, no electricity, no cars, no areoplanes? Of course you don't. OK, then, believe in our modern world with it's [wd3,1-2] wonderful science, technology and industrialization. They are the resources of dreams and imagination.  (t14-10)  	Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination.  	To some extent, they have reasons to think so. As we all know, with the development of industry, the environment we are living in is deteriorating. The big cities, especially those with heavy industry, have grown into the cities of chimneies [fm2,-] Black and dense smoke rolls into the sky and people no longer see clear, blue sky. Another serious problem of our modern world is that people are leading a tense life. Many have turned into workalcoholics [fm1,-] Their minds are crammed with numbers, formula [np6,2-2] and machines. There is no room left in their mind to imagine or to dream. Tired as they come back from work, their only desire is to sleep.  	We can no longer ignore the two problems of pollution and overworking. It's time to take measures to do something. Because we have only one earth, and we will receive punishment from earth in the not-so-distant future. And if people have all turned into workalcoholics [fm1,-] who only live for working, certainly they will say there is no place for imagination, because they never imagine what is the meaning of their living in the world.  	But, should we be so pessimist [wd2,4-] as to deny that there is [vp3,s-] still places for dreaming and imagination? Just go out of the industrialised big [wd1,2-1] cities on holidays to find some place natural, and you will be astonished by your discovery.  	I have a scandalwood [fm1,-] bracelet, and every time I take it out, its fragrance brings me back to the days when I was in Mount Putuo in summer vacation. Mount Putuo, an island in the East Sea, is embraced by crystal green water. It has a winding and undulating coastline dotted with rugged rocks and delightful scenery: the lofty peaks, the splendid temples, the exquisite pavilions and the gurgling springs. Everything seemed so mysterious and sacred. I could not help wandering: "Is this a place in the world or in heaven?" Placing myself close to nature in such a place, I felt my soul was pure and clear, away from any ill wills.  	I believe the development of science and technology does not only have the negative influence. We should not reject it because it has defects. Problems must be studied before they can be solved. It will certainly offer us methods to fight all the disadvantages. 

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH B2W> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (b2w-t14-1)   People can't live without dreaming and imagination.   There are two worlds human being [np6,3-1] live [sn8,s-] [sn9,s-] one is [wd4,s-] physical world, the other is [wd4,s-] mental world. Since the first person appears [vp6,s-] in [wd3,2-2] the earth, there are [vp6,s-] conflicts and war [np6,s-] because of strife [wd2,-] for living, [sn1,s-] while people are dreaming of living in a world full of happiness and peacefulness, however, [sn7,s-] now the history of human being [np6,4-] has come [cc2,6-] to the 20th century, the dream has not been realized, the shadow of war still permeate [vp3,5-] in the world. Dream [np6,-3] is just dream [np6,3-] [sn9,s-] it is [wd4,s-] product of [wd4,1-2] mental world, unreal and fanceful [fm1,-]   Although people live in a physical world, seemingly everybody are [vp3,1-] stuggling [fm1,-] for food, clothing, shelter, [sn1,s-] there is always a secret place in people's heart for their dreaming and imagination whenever past or future, hard or lucky, young or old [sn8,s-]   When we trace back to the primitive society, [sn3,s-] our anscestor [fm2,-] [np3,-1] were living in the dim and damp cave, firing to keep away beast [np6,2-] averagly [fm1,-] they lived for ten years in [wd3,-2] the earth. When the evening comed [fm2,-] they might be sitting in front of cave [np6,1-] observing the stars in the sky, dreaming of a warm and clean place for them to hide, dreaming of [pp1,1-s-] there would be enough food for them to store. Suppose a primitive man came to nowadays [wd1,-] modern society, what would he think? There are many movies representing this type of story in the western countries. If there was no dreaming and imagination, there would not have been the development and progress of human kind [fm2,1-] we would have lived in the same condition as the primitive society, because the world remains stastic [fm1,-]   People imagine [vp1,-2] to live in a more convinient [fm1,-] condition, a philosopher says that the desire of human is limitless, which cause [vp3,s-] convention [wd3,s-] and creation, for example, the appear [wd2,1-1] of the electric lamp, the battery, the paper, the compass, etc., [sn9,s-] the children are encouraged to use their imagination, for the dreaming and imagination push the society forward and make people live to the fullfillness [fm2,-]   Nowadays society is dominated by technology and Industralization [fm1,-] some people say there is no place for dreaming and imagination. Actually if there is human being [np6,2-] existing, there is dream [np6,2-] Movie [np6,-2] is one of the embodyment [fm2,-] [np6,3-] of dreaming, in which people can feel the fanceful [fm1,-] experience that can't be felt in the real life. Although our society is rather industralized [fm1,-] and developed, I belive [fm1,-] that nobody will say he is satisfied with the present life, so one of [wd4,2-2] ways to escape the disatisfaction [fm2,-] is dreaming of a short romance, living in [wd3,1-4] [wd4,1-4] remote and islated [fm1,-] island, finding a golden hill suddenly. Some people feel them lose dream saying [wd7,s-] [sn8,s-] it is beacause [fm1,-] the nose [wd7,2-] the concrete building block [vp3,5-] their imaginative ability, [sn9,s-] oppositely the place of fance [fm1,-] is wild, there are so many problems unsolved and our anscestor [fm1,-] [np6,1-1] leave us a lot of riddles to think. Our world is a combination of realness and fance [fm1,-] If we are to explore the fance [fm1,-] boldly, we will find the place for realness is becoming wilder and wilder, our dreaming is becoming bigger [wd4,1-1] bigger.   Leave ourselves more place to dream and imagine, because we can not live without them just like the fish without water. (b2w-t14-2)  Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialization, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. Mayby [fm1,-] it sounds not wrong [sn8,s] however, when you give it a second thought, you'll find it is entirely wrong.  Firstly, the world is not dominated by the science, technology. It is true that they are playing an important role in human life, the human city has, and absolutely will, become more and more dependent on them, which help people step in the way leading to a modern, comfortable, and rich world. For one thing, computers are being popularly used almost in every field of work such as the computer-controlled-telephone, computer-designing, computer-literature-writing and even large scale industrial and agricultural production. The use of computers save [vp3,3-] a lot of labors. In the near future, when the computer net work system will be established perfectly, people will be able to do everything like shopping, working, cooking and etc., in their own homes. It looks like computers have prepared everything ready, what people should do is to follow the way set by computers.  However it is people who invented and created computers, and input the ready-designed procedures which have been converted into different signals. What computers can only do is to receive signals and make corresponding responds [wd2,2-] They are unable to improve or change themselves. People can creat [fm1,-] them, also destroy them. Obviously, people have much stronger power. People direct computers to do what they want them to do. In other words, people design the way of life and realize it through means of all kinds.  Science and technology are the objective existance [fm2,-] people can learn and use them for certain purpose [np6,2-] Before getting [vp1,-2] know of the existance [fm2,-] of them, people only can imagine and dream the existance [fm2,-] of them. Scores of years before, people looked at the moon dreaming someday they would be able to fly onto it, but now, it is a piece of cake. People can send rockets into space and fly onto the moon in rockets. As a matter of fact, from having no knowledge to getting known of them is a period of active research, not passive activities. So it is human beings [sn8,s-] dominate the modern society, not science or technology.  Now let's come to the next point: what's the dreaming? Dreaming is a kind of mental activity, unvisible [fm2,-] untouchable, existing in human minds. No matter if the dreams become true or not, at least they express the people's wishes to develop [fm1,-] in some ways. From dreams to realization is a period of creation. Dream [np6,-1] is a kind of guess, sometimes full of romantic thoughts, sometimes sounds a little bit foolish. But a lot of facts prove that dreams could be realized through the painstaking efforts of human beings. Dreaming and realization are two different, but strictly tied processes. Dreaming always leads the way. Dreaming is a kind of mental actions of human brains, while realization is [vp3,-2] physical activities. Therefore, two steps can not be reversed or one replaces the other. People will not stop dreaming. Where there are people, there is a place of dreaming.  So we should say it is human beings who dominate the world and there is a dreaming place forever. (b2w-t14-3)   Someone once said growing up is painting [wd7,s-] troublesome because of the incessent [fm1,-] breaking of our colorful dreams, true! And it's also the same with the growing up or developing of our world. We can not deny that this planet is getting more and more practical, people are obsessed with finding a way of climbing to the top of material life, [sn9,s-] in terms of this, shall we draw a conclusion that there is absolutely no longer a place for dreaming and imagination? No, not so absolutely, the answer is determined by people' individual personality. For me, I definitely know there's always a place in my heart for dreaming of my utopia.   With the high development of science and technology and industrialisation, our world is being made more and more like a programmed computer. Everything is well-organized, every step is well-designed in advance. Isn't it good or not? Of course, it's helpful. Industrialisation saves us a lot of time, makes our life convenient. Industrialisation itself has nothing to do with reducing our time of romantic dreams, on the contrary, it improves our living standard, provides us better opportunity to enjoy our life. But, it is the side-effect of industrialisation that makes people greedy of [wd3,3-2] material interests. With the highly developed industry, the need of [wd3,2-2] qulified [fm1,-] professionals are [vp3,5-] increasing, thus, every body [fm2,1-] trys [fm2,-] to elbow others, then reaches to the first position and people have to learn something relating to industrialisation, no matter whether they want to learn it. Art and literrature [fm1,-] are defeated by industry, writers and artists have to serve industrialised society. The competition is keen [cc4,2-] [sn9,s-] it seems nobody can escape.   However, in this morden [fm1,-] world, I feel the small land of pure soil in my heart becoming more and more precious, it shines like a star, pointing out the final home of my life, that is purity, tranquility, and love. I'm sure there are lots of people having the same dreams like my dream. We all want to find a pure place. [wd4,s-] More industrialised the world is, [wd4,s-] more anxiously I hunger for such a place. Human relation is destroyed [vp6,-4] to some degree already, [sn1,-s-] but I'm sure indifference, [wd4,1-1] cruelty [cc2,1-3] must be taken [vp1,s-] place by warmness and kindness, because as long as there are human being [np6,2-] ther [fm1,-] are [vp3,s-] love. Love of friends, parents and children, brothers and sisters remain [vp3,s-] the spark of man's good nature flaming forever.   So, my opinion of this matter is quite clear, we struggling in this modern world is to turn utopia in our dream into reality [sn8,s-]  

<ST 6> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GW> <AGE ?> <WAY 3> <DIC 1> <TYP 1> (t1-1)   Crime has been at the heart of our society. People often discuss it. Inevitably, there exist different attitudes towards it. Some people consider, [sn9,s-] since things always have negative effect as well as postive [fm1,-] effect, it is the same with crime. In my opinion, crime does not pay.   First of all, crime is an ill phenomenon. It benefits no one. Maybe offenders can get benefit from it, but temporarily [sn2,s-] They will have to answer for their wrongdoing one day, in one way or the other [pp2,5-]   Imagine how a crime is conducted. Before you conduct it, you brew it. It is a prelude to a crime. Only after you plan it carefully can you carry out your plot successfully. So you will no doubt be occupied with it. You take every detail into consideration to avoid your plot blowing out like a soap bubble. As a result, what you live with daily is such kind of things. How can you lead a happy life? Then after a crime is carried out, there are two possible result [np3,2-] before you. One is that your crime is discussed on the spot or later by police, followed by your being put into jail to pay a price for what you have done. On this occasion, it is evident that crime does not pay at all. Since things always have some exceptions, though you break the law by conducting a crime, fortunately your crime is not discovered and you escape concrete punishments. But what you can not escape is you suffer inwordly [wf1,-] You keep worrying about your crime being unearthed. So you are on the alert all the times [np5,2-] Even a smallest incident which appears to be connected with your crime makes you startled. That means, though you have achieved your purpose, you cannot enjoy it happily [cc5,2-] In fact, you pay a price for it all the same.   In a nutshell, whatever crime you conduct, you have to pay a price for it, in action or in mind. In another word, crime does not pay.  (t1-2)   Crime does not pay. No matter how shrewd a criminal might be, he is doomed to be a loser whenever he starts his crime. Crime may help criminals get what they want illegally. It seems to them that crime does pay. However, crime costs a lot more than it possibly gives, for criminals can never escape without punishment, which is only a matter of time. Crime does not pay at all in the long run.   The main inducement to commit crime, I think, is to obtain something that a criminal desparately [wf1,-] wants, but can not get in a legal way at the moment. When he lets his lust run wild, he has to turn to crime. Once he gets what he has struggled so hard for, he must be content as well as frightened, becaus [fm1,-] he knows, since then, he is in danger of getting caught. However, he wishes he might be able to escape. With such a slight hope, he may enjoy his life temporarily. Before long, he drops into the abyss of torment.   On the whole, there are roughly two kinds of criminals. One kind is those who still have their guilty consciences. They are aware [aj1,-s-] what they have done unduely [fm1,-] and of the gravity of the the [wd5,s-] consequences that may follow. In fear of receiving severe punishment, they do not dare to confess their crimes. So they are torn between guilt and fear every moment as long as they are not discovered. To them, crime has given them much more pain than pleasure. The other kind is those who regard committing crimes as nothing. They are also scared at the thought of the possibility of getting caught, though they do not feel a little guilt of their crimes. They know they have to be extremely careful of themselves. It is imaginable that they, therefore, spend every minute under the terrible stress. Both kinds of criminals are under the strong pressure that their crimes have put. Obviously they don't lead an easy life. Can crime pay for what they have suffered?   Besides mental punishment, crime can not pay for legal punishments. The laws, the police, the courts and the prisons are all established against crimes. It is their main function to prevent crimes from happening, to inflict appropriate punishments upon criminals and, if possible, to remould them as well. Meanwhile, people possess a great hatre [wf1,-] for criminals. In such circumstances, no criminals can conceal their crimes for long because they are always isolated in the society and pursuited [wd2,-] by the police. There are no permanent places for criminals to hide. Whoever breaks the law, his crimes will be exposed to the public one day. And he will receive punishments that he deserves without doubt. Usually crime leads to a loss of freedom, or even one's life. There have always been a lot of stories about those criminals who felt very regretful after being caught, because they started to understand freedom and life were much more valuable. What is more regretable [fm2,-] is that they didn't have a chance to wipe off what they had done, for what has been done cannot be undone.   Generally speaking, crime can never pay. Those who commit crimes are doomed to failure. What they get by means of crimes require them of something [wd1,3-] they originally possess. When they succeed in getting what they terribly want, they lose that [wd5,s-] something more valuable at the same thing [pp2,3-] ; worse luck [sn3,s-] they can never keep what they have got for long. After all, they cannot escape. When they realize crime does not pay, it is too late.  (t1-3) 	 Nowadays, at every corner of the world, there will be at least a case of crime happening every minute. This severely destroy [vp3,2-] people's daily life. Here, I want to warn these criminals "Crime does not pay."   First, psychologically, committing crime is the major cause of anxiety and horror to most criminals. From the beginning, risks accompany crime and, in the depth of every criminal's heart, there must be an extreme fear of death. The sense of guilty also puts a heavy burden on their minds. With the increasing pressure, the criminals are apt to become more and more over- sensitive. Nomatter [fm2,-] [wd4,s-] before, during or after the crime, they have to keep a state of alert. Being alarmed at even a common motion of the policeman, they are just like the birds startled by the mere twang of a bow-string. They live in the nightmare all the day, which will one day in the future drive them mad. The constant state of dread could lead to the uncommunicative and eccentic [fm1,-] disposition of a criminal. Being so isolated from friends and relatives, they can only get satisfaction from the alcohol, the drug, or the club. So at last even though they are lucky enough not to die in prison, they may end up in a life devoid of meaning. It's possible that criminals can get a lot of money. But, they also lose the most valuable treasure in the world: the love, the true feelings between people, the enjoyment of having a calm life.   In addition, the criminals are also at the risk of being killed by their colleagues. Today, the internal struggles for power among different factions in the gangs are fierce. You are likely to be the next victim at any time. On the other hand, the disciplines of the gangs are strict. If you leak the secrecy or are unfortunately discovered by the police, you will be shot relentlessly.   Secondly, the law will give a fair judge [wd2,3-3] to every criminal. The continuously rising rate of crime in these years has caused more and more attention of the government and citizens. Thus the appeals for more efficient police system become stronger. As a result, the police forces have been strengthened greatly. The rapidly increasing international cooperation have [vp3,5-1] made great achievements. All this spreads a dig [wd2,1-1] net for pursuing the criminals. In recent years, a number of criminals in the famous gangs have surrendered to the police under the pressure of deep investigation by the govenment [fm1,-] Because of that, the heads of these gangs are arrested one after another and face a list of charges. So today's criminals really have a hard time.   In a word, no matter how cunning the criminal is he can't escape the punishment in the end. Everyone would pay for what he has done. Therefore I still want to persuade [vp1,-s-] those criminals "Pull back before it's too late."  (t1-4)   There's an old Chinese saying to the effect that ultimately good behaviour will be rewared [fm1,-] and evil behaviour will get punishment. This saying derives from the creed of Buddism and has been handed down for many generations as a truth. It has been the experience of many people. I think this saying is correct at any time. Criminal will finally be punished. Crime is never a profitable business.   Why does crime exist? Interest is the focus of the matter. Some people want to possess something by means of encroaching the right of other people. The manner of their making profit is not fairplay for other [np6,1-] Other people suffer from your behaviour. Undoubtedly, the other people will take action to prevent the encroachment. Or, if their rights have been encroached, they will take revenge.   Some crimes are stopped before the criminals benefit from his [pr3,3-] action. Certainly, their crime does not pay. But a large proportion of criminals can benefit from their crime. Then the revenge comes. The victim of the crime can ask the authority to punish the criminal. In this case, the authority will intervene.   Suppose a criminal has made a large sum of money by robbing, cheating or else [sn2,s-] He may spend his money to enjoy himself. He maybe lives in luxury, which is impossible for him if he lives on his salary. But later, he will be caught by the police. According to how much money he has made illegally, he will be sentenced. The punishment is equal to the encroachment he has done to the other. He has to sacrify [fm1,-] something for his crime. In this case, crime does not pay as well.   Some criminals are perhaps wanted by the police for a long time. But most of them are caught at last. It is only a matter of time. I remember an event about a Nazi war criminal. After the II [wd3,1-2] World War, he escaped to Argentina. He killed a lot of Jews in the concentrated camp during the war. He changed his name and got a passport of Argentina. His trace disappeared. But the Jews insisted on searching for him because of his unforgivable crime. At last he was killed by Isreali [fm1,-] special agents. Therefore punishment is only a matter of time. Criminals must pay something for the evil.   But it can't be ruled out that some criminal [np3,1-] can escape without any punishment and enjoy their lives in some corner of the world. Few criminals can manage to escape the pursuit of the police. Maybe they can enjoy their illegal income. But can they really enjoy their lives? No. They are always in the fear that some time they might be caught by the police or killed by their enemy. All the time, they have their hearts in their mouths. Despite [pp1,-s-] they have beautiful clothes and eat delicious food, they don't feel happy. This is the punishment that they ought to receive.   Crime does not pay. The criminal will be punished by the other, by law or by themselves.  (t1-5)   Ever since human beings formed a society, never had [vp6,s-] crime [wd1,s-] once been stopped. Also, never had crime [wd1,s-] paid: most of the criminals sowed the wind and reaped the whirlwind.   In the slave and the fuderal [fm1,-] society [np3,4-] there were series of cruel laws against crime, though some were of limitation and just a kind of physical punishment. For example, if someone stole something, he might get his hands cut off according to the law. It might be primitive and cruel, but to steal is immoral and illegal, he had to pay something back.   With the development of society, crime, as one of the social problems, also becomes more complicated and even crueller. Murder, rape, smuggling, highjacking, robbery, etc, all kinds of serious crimes are happening. It seems that orders for arrest [wd4,s-] everywhere. You might not feel safe as these criminals are still at large while [cj1,s-] doubt the effiency [fm1,-] of the police and the law.   But governments [np5,s-] are putting forth more and more detailed law items and more police to fight against criminals. In almost each country, there are police that have been specially trained and equiped [fm2,-] with the first-class weapons. Even some animals are trained for this special area. As crime becomes a serious social problem, people become aware of it and give much more prssure [fm1,-] on the issue.   Computers also become popular in fighting against crime. It can give the police referrence [fm1,-] about the criminals, their backgrounds, experiences, etc. It can even judge a person's appearance according to a small fingerprint.   Police with special training are the backbone of this fight. They are skillful at watching, following, analysing, and making judgements. They even disguise themselves and enter the criminal organization to get the first hand information. There are [vp3,-3] also international cooperation in this area. So you can see from many news [np5,1-] that criminals are caught after they flee to another country. Wherever criminals go, police will follow them till the right chance comes and get them caught and put into prison.   As for criminals themselves, they have to suffer a lot of psychological burdens. Even if they're not ashamed of their action, they still have to always worry about their future after they commit some crime. They are nervous, they are afraid of being found out. They are no longer at ease. They lose the joy of life --- going astray, farther and farther from their happiness, till one day they are found and the end comes to them. Such burden is more unbearable than poverty or any heavy labour work or physical diseases.   To lead a life as a criminal pays too much at his own price [pp2,-] Before commiting [fm1,-] a crime, one still has many ways to change the situation, but if he chooses the illegal way, he has only one way to go --- go to the court to be sentenced.   The advanced detective system, the experienced police force and the concious [fm1,-] people will not let the criminals escape from the net of justice. Everyone should know that we need a calm and peaceful world full of love, but not crime.  (t1-6)   The amount of crime increases rapidly in our society. For the sake of money, more and more gangsters turn to crime from which they benefit a lot. They don't believe they will get any punishment. But, crime does not pay in fact.  In most of the cases, criminals are doomed to be put in the court for trial at last. No matter how cruel and cunning they are, they still couldn't get off scot-free, because our merciless law is forever effective, because we are making every effort to crack down crime all the time. Various kinds of crimes have posed a great threat to our daily life, [sn9,s-] in order to root out this social malady, our government has taken measures to strengthen the law, to punish criminals severely without any mercy. With an aversion to crime, ordinary people take an active part in the action against it. Gradually a trend against crime has come into being everywhere. Under such circumstances, criminals seem to have little chance to escape. The more crimes they commit, the more severely they will be punished. The law is to take revenge on them sooner or later. In recent years, some fascists of the World War II have been caught and sentenced. Although fifty years have passed since the end of that massacre, their outrage still receive [vp3,2-] severe punishment today. Because we people forever keep the notion of justice in mind, we forever fight against crime. That is why crime does not pay. There is an old Chinese saying which has proved to be precise: Good will be rewarded with good, and evil with evil.   If one has ever commit [vp9,4-2] certain crime and escape [vp9,s-] by chance. He is more likely to lead his life with anxiety from then on, always being afraid of getting his retribution one day. This psychological punishment must be more severe. For a criminal who has been hidding [fm2,-] for some time [sn2,s-] Nightmares occur to him frequently. The fear haunting in his mind can drive him mad. From [wd3,s-] [pp1,-] this unbearable psychological punishment, one can never lead an easy life. Only when he has surrendered to the police, he [wd1,s-] can feel relaxed. Still, crime does not pay.   Other criminals who have escaped may continue with evil, regardless of the fact that he will propably [fm1,-] be killed in the conflicts between different gangs or be caught in the meshes of law sooner or later.   There may be some loopholes in the present law, our legal system may still be imperfect. But the position of law is always the same, aiming at cracking down crime and finally eliminate crime. The steadiness of our society relies on law, all men are equal before the law and anyone who dare [vp3,s-] to break it will certainly get his punishment. That is the way law takes effect. Crime does not pay. This is forever the truth.  (t1-7)   In our democratic society, we prevent people from doing harm to the society or to an individual by making laws. Generally, laws are made in the interests of our people. Anyone who break [vp3,s-] the laws will and should be punished. For the nature of the laws [pp1,s-] crimes are undoutbly [fm1,-] improfitable and disadvantageous to our society or an individual.   Last year in Niaoning province, when a case was submitted to the court, it gave rise to a good deal of controversy among people. Both sides seemed to be reasonable and we still sentenced the criminal --- a woman of about 36 years old --- to death. Because the crimes she committed had caused a lot of trouble to a child and great damage to the society.   The woman wounded the child by pouring surphuric [fm1,-] acid on the boy's face. She was not evil in her nature. She did it on impulse just to take revenge on the child's father who never kept his promise to divorce his father [wd3,s-] and marry her. In hospital, a reporter visited the poor boy who was still unconscious. His face was completely destroyed by the cruel lady. One of his eyes lost sight and the mouth couldn't shut.   Any crimes in our society are harmful and the criminals should receive their deserving punishment. But the criminal's colleges [wd7,s-] referred a petition to the court, in which they required the judge to mitigated [vp5,1-] the punishment for her. They claimed that she was a good work [wd2,-] and received prizes from the firm for several times. The child's father had to be responsible for this because he played fast and loose with a woman's affection. It was the child's father who made [vp1,s-] her lose her confidence for life and ventured to take revenge.   I can't deny that the boy's father had something to do with the crime. His behaviour could be the main cause of the tragedy. But pleading for mitigation for the woman is ridiculous. Her crime is very harmful and dangerous to our society.   Let's take a look at the poor and heartily sympathizing [vp5,s-] child. His doctor told us that some organs of the child would lose their function such as [pp1,s-] one of his eyes was blind now. The appearance of his face couldn't recover any more though he still need [vp3,s-] skin tranplantation [fm1,-] before 18 years [wd5,s-] for 3 times. In his whole life, he had [vp6,s-] no ability of taking care of himself.   The boy's suffering is obvious. The opportunity of enjoying a happy life for him was unreasonably taken away.   Actually, every crime undoutbly [fm1,-] does harm both to the victim, and to the society. The society has to devote its time and energe [fm1,-] to repair the damage caused by the crime. Even some crimes will bring far-reaching influence to the society. Without severe punishment to [pp1,4-] the criminal, the crime may lead people to parot [fm1,-] The aforementioned woman deserved the severe punishment because he [wd3,s-] had set a bad example. There's no doubt that unmatured [fm1,-] children are weak in power, and it is easy for us to harm them. If we all try to take revenge on our rivals by harming their powerless children or other relatives, our society will be in a disorder. The children's existence will be threatened.   Crime doesn't pay. You may be able to catch a robber who stole a lot of money from a bank, but may have already run out of all the stolen money. You have no may [fm1,-] to repair all the damage the criminal did. So it is safe to prevent any crimes from being made. If necessary, the punishment for the criminals must be very severe.  (t1-8)   Crime is a serious social problem. It jeopardizes the public security and is a great threat to people's lives and property. For the one who commits crime, no matter how capable he might be, and how thorough his plan might be, he cannot escape punishment. A famous saying, "Crime does not pay", shows that once you commit crime, you can get nothing in the end but punishment.   There are many kinds of punishments. The most obvious one is that you will be punished by law if you commit crime. Though the sentence may be as light as one or two years in prison, it will cast a great shadow on your way to your future. Nowadays, there are such kind [np3,s-] of young people who have a wealthy family but still want to get more money to buy expensive shoes or beautiful ten-speed bicycle [np6,3-] So they defy the law and try to steal money or even rob others of their wallets. When they are doing those things, they never think much but just regard them as exciting things that may show one's courage. And at last, most of them have to be sent to prison. They ruin their own youth, moral quality and prospects. There are also some people who are in high position, but are corrupt and negligent about their duties. They are like living on the tip of an active volcano. Once their crimes are discovered, their property which are [vp3,3-1] gained in an illegal way will be confiscated, and they themselves will be dismissed from the office. Even worse than that, they will be seriously punished by law. Those people are greedy and stupid. They never [wd4,s-] satisfied with what they have already had and just want to get more. And that makes them lose far more things than they have got.   Another kind of punishment is the guilty feeling inside your mind. Committing crime will make you live in anxiety. Wherever you go, you feel that everyone around you knows what you have done, and so you will feel very uncomfortable. Most people have a judge living inside their bodies, who is called "conscience". It will always reminds you of what you have done, and worry you now and then. And you'll have to bear a heavy burden from then on.   I think that's why in so many novels, the criminals succeeding in evasion of legal sanction failed to live a happy life. They liked to move to a small and quiet town, and then lived alone, without any friends, far from colorful lives. Maybe that's one way to atone for their crimes.   Crime can have other bad effects. It can detroy [fm1,-] a warm family. If one member of the family has committed an offence, others will be anxious and worried. And if he has to be sent to prison, and separated from the family, how can the whole family live happily and peacefully? So when committing crime, you have not only yourself to consider but you [pr4,-1] family. And may be [fm2,-] you'll be sensible enough to stop doing it.   Another thing is that once you have been in prison, others will always remember that. So they can hardly trust you and regard you as one of their friends. You will find it very difficult to get a job and dealing [vp5,s-] with people around you. That punishment can be more severe than just being sent to prison.   So whenever you want to commit crime, you must control yourself and try to do something good for the society.   You can never benefit from what you may have done. Because you will lose a lot more than you might get. [sn2,s] And you will be seviously [fm1,-] punished by law, by yourself, and by the society.  (t1-9)   Crime is a common sign of modern society. Criminals committed crimes for a variety of reasons. Does crime have so much attraction? Does it pay? As the old saying goes: "One good turn deserves another", so is "one bad turn deserves another." Crime does not pay.   In one case, there was a married man who was manager of a big firm and had a happy family. He happened to meet another pretty girl and fell in love with her. He stole a huge sum of money from the firm and eloped with the girl. He had some illusion of his future life: A lot of money, no more working and a comfortable life. But in fact, he never had a happy day ever since. He lived in panic all day long. Very soon, his crime was discovered and his reputation was ruined. He lost his well-paid job as well as his family. His firm traced [wd3,d] back the money he stole, otherwise they would hand him to the police. The girl left him. No one wanted to hire him. He was as poor as a church mouse. In the end, in poverty and with shame, he died realizing that crime did not pay.   There are mainly 3 reasons why crime does not pay.   First, those who committed crimes always have an uneasy conscience. Like a bird startled by the mere twang of bow-string, they invariably lived in panics, afraid of being discovered. Even though they might escape to a faraway place and change their names [sn2,s-] Yet somehow, they can't have a peaceful mind, they can't have that kind of psychological balance which is essential to a happy life. They lived unstably, hiding from place to place. Wherever they go, they feel that there are detectives following them, and people around them are eyeing them reproachfully and scornfully. They couldn't keep their heads up and walk straight. Everything reminds them of their crimes and of the sufferings they are causing. They only keep to themselves. They fear that God will punish them and that justice will be done even without human intervention.   Second, criminals can hardly escape the meshes of law. For example, New York is a city of high crime rate. As a result, there are a lot of prisons which are always overcrowded. The police are efficient. They can clear up a case within a few days. The public are called upon to give relevant information and keep an eye on the traces of the criminals. Out of a desire and a respect for justice, the public are always willing to help the police. Once the criminals are arrested, they are sent to prison and get severe punishment and have to reform through labour. Some are even sentenced to death, thus end their earthly life which otherwise could have been stable and happy.   Third, criminals are the discasts [fm1,-] of society. Once a person has committed a crime, they [pr3,s-] become the enemies of the public. People avoid them. They are isolated. They can hardly hope to live decently again. After coming out of the prison, they have great difficulty in finding jobs and earn an honest living. Thus, they are likely to turn to crime again. And the vicious cirle [fm1,-] continues. They also brought [vp6,d] shame to their family. If they have any children, the children would be cold-shouldered by others. And there would be shadows in their heart which would be fatal to their growing up. They are likely to be cynical, eccentric and depressed adults.  In conclusion, crime does not pay. Everyone should be clear of that.  (t1-10)   It is news if there does not occur a stabbing, gangfight or kidnap for a day in any of the big towns of [wd3,s-] [sn8,s-] this century. Anytime and anywhere you and I can hear or see a crime committed; anytime and anywhere you and I can be victims of a gang clash. It seems that we are living in a criminal-ridden society, with no security, no pleasure, but with terror and fear. Crime has really made a success of life-assurance companies. So, many people may ask: "Why are there so many crimes? Does crime pay?"   To answer these questions, here first I would like to quote the confession of a men who voluntarily surrendered himself to the police ten years after he committed the crime. "Ten years ago, I was very poor. So one day, I stole a large sum of money ($700,000) from a company, and they did not discover. I thought there should be a great change in my later life. However, after that day, I was leading an even worse life. Everyday I lived in terror. I feared to be discovered. I lied to my friends, my colleagues, and even my wife, my children. I did not dare to go out with friends for a cup of beer, lest I should let the cat out of the bag. I kept myself away from people. People thought I was abnormal, even my wife and children did that. Later my wife divorced me, my boss fired me. I lost my friends, my job, my family and my confidence in life. I was in complete despair. And Now I am here..." From this, we can see clearly that crime does not pay. This guy "luckily" escaped the punishment of law at first, however, "the runaway monk cannot run away with temple." Undoubtedly, he had suffered much more than he had gained in the century-long [fm2,-] ten years, not to mention the following years he would have to pull [cc3,5-] in prison.   Since it is so, why are there still so many crimes in our society? For this, I think, there are 3 reasons. Firstly, the spirit of bravado, idleness and dare which makes people, especially young people, join forces of undesirable nature has a strong connection with the crimes. And of course, money is the direct motive of quite a number of stabbings, killings, and kidnappings. Secondly, some of us dismiss criminals as though they don't count, forgetting that criminals, like a cancer, is [vp3,s-] eating deep into the society of which we are members. The sad part of the story is that we lack a civic sense which, if displayed wisely, will not only help us face the dangers of the criminals but eradicate this evil from our society altogether. Thirdly, our legal system is still far from perfect. Our present legal system always falls behind in the persuit [fm1,-] of the changeable world, and leaves loopholes for criminals. This is probably the most important reason.  Fortunately, more and more people, including politians [fm1,-] are coming to realize these problems and are taking measures to solve them. People are standing out to fight the criminals; people are improving and strengthening the legal systems. This surely will provide no loopholes for the criminals to make use of and no chances for the criminals to get away with it [wd5,s-] If there is anyone who can "luckily" escape from the punishmnet [fm1,-] by law, he will never be able to escape from the punishment by morality. He is definitely to be punished morally, if not legally.   SO, Crime Does Not Pay.  (t1-11)   Crime has been a serious social problem nowadays. There are many reasons why people commit crimes, such as lacking [np1,-] of money, unemployment, excessive drinking, drug taking, etc. [wd5,s-] Among these, these is one which is very important but has often been ignored --- the idea of leaving things to chances. This psychological factor has made many people commit crimes, especially those who are hesitating whether they would do the evil things or not. Can a criminal really escape from punishment? Is the say "Crime does not pay" true?   Once a person commits a crime, his fate is decided. He will either be punished by law or has [vp6,s-] a narrow escape. Most criminals are unlucky, because development of technology has provided police with better equipment to crack criminal cases, they cannot escape from the punishment of the law. Each country has its own laws, and for a same crime, the punishment may be different. But on the whole the law is justice. Criminals have to pay more than what they have got from committing crimes. For example, if a person stole $10,000 from a bank in China, he may be sentenced. Although to our Chinese $10,000 is a large sum of money, it cannot be equal to a person's life. If the same crime happens in U.S., the criminal may have to be in prison for several years. The punishment is less severe than that in China, but to an American, $10,000 does not worth several year's freedom. From the example we can draw an [np7,-1] conclusion that crime does not pay. A criminal must pay more than he have [vp3,s-] got.   However, there are criminals escaping from punishment of the law. It may seem that they have been well paid for the crime. But can they really escape from punishment? An example will give you the answer. If a person had killed [vp6,d] an old lady and robbed [vp6,d] away all her money, and the police failed [vp6,d] to find out the murderer. He is really very lucky. But if, unfortunately, he still remain [vp3,2-] his human nature [cc1,1-] during the course of investigation, he will be very nervous, his mind may fill with fear, and he may be at the edge of mental collapse. Even [ad2,-] the investigation is over, the fear and also a kind of regret will remain deeply in his mind, torture his nerves every time he think [vp3,s-] of it. And for ages he cannot get rid of it, maybe he will bring it into grace [wd7,-] If he had been put [vp6,s-] into prison, he may loss [vp9,1- his freedom, but he will not suffer from this kind of mental punishment, which is more painful [wd4,s-] more severe.   And also, there are criminals who are callous, cold-blooded. They do not fear [wd3,1-] of anything, do not regret at any evil things they have done. These criminal [np3,1-] are always committing crimes, maybe they can escape for one or two even three times, there will be the day they are caught an [fm1,-] punished by the law. This kind of people can never escape from punishment.   So, in sum, crime does not pay. Once a person commit [vp3,2-] a crime, he will have to pay more than he got [vp6,s-] Criminals will never escape from punishment.  (t1-12)   Nowadays, different kinds of crimes become more and more common in people's daily life. Its scale, ranging from individual to international, is far beyond the reach of CIA or KGB. However, crime does not pay. In order to keep the world's peace and security, we must fight a great war against it, more fiercely and firmly than ever.   Firstly, crimes cost a lot of lives. They bring chaos into the society, making it dangerous for people to live in. Each year a large number of people lost their lives in different kinds of crimes, such as robbery, rapes and murdering. The battlefield of justice against evil is soaked in blood and big forture [fm1,-] flowing to the criminal's pockets is at the expense of thousands even millions of innocent lives. The heart-breaking news of losing one's parents, spouse or children attacks people, like a bolt from the blue and can easily drive them mad. The criminal's ruthlessness and crulty [fm1,-] make the tears, which were cried over the death of the innocent people, frozen into ice. The pain in their hearts will never cease so long as they are breathing and they believe firmly one day all of their criminal behaviours must be answered.   Secondly, crimes disturb the public order. Committing a crime means taking terrorist actions. Kidnapping, arsenal, hijiking [fm1,-] and munitions smuggling, which constitute an indispensable part of today's newspaper, are adding more intenser [aj3,1-] atmosphere to this already shaky and unstable world. It becomes obvious that in our strive for a better life in a comparatively peaceful situation, crimes must be put an end to.   Another reason for us to call for a desistance [fm1,-] from committing crimes is that even you can escape the country's law, you have no possibility to escape the punishment from yourself and the justice. The social moralities, along with the self-conscience, working as a sharp blade, cut both your flesh and soul to the last drop of blood. In your longly [fm2,-] exile away from peace and harmony, a life-long sentence will surely be bound up with you till the last minute.   Finally, people have spent decades, generations and even centuries fighting against the evil and the unjust, however, it's such a long and hard struggle that it seems there's no possibility for people to win the campaign. Since there's human [np6,1-] existing in the world, crimes become inevitable and won't disappear automatically. However, with our great efforts, the high crime rates can be lowered and a better world can be realized, since there is always something ahead to prevent us from losing confidence and courage, we believe firmly that one day justice and fairness will come true.  (t1-13)   The execution of the policy of opening to the world and economic reform has brought us a lot of advanced scientific technology and other countries' culture. We really benefit much from them. It has brought other social rubbish as well. As the production [wd3,s-] of society, crime is growing at a rapid speed at the same time of the development of economic [wd2,1-] Its existance [fm2,-] seriously jeopardize [vp3,3-] the public security and the people's benefit.   As for the end [wd2,-]of crime there are some kinds of opinions. However, in the final analysis, that is a Chinese old saying --- "Good will be awarded with good, and evil with evil."   When I try to understand what crime does not pay, it seems to me that it can be find [vp9,2-] in two spheres. The one which one goes [vp1,s-] more apparent [wd2,s-] is the strict punishment by the law enforcement engency [fm1,-] A criminal, whatever [wd5,-2] how [wd3,3-1] skillful he is, [sn5,s-] he will leave some traces. It is these traces that he can hardly escape from the meshess [fm1,-] of law [sn8,s-] So that is called "you can't wrap fire in paper". Following [wd4,s-] increase of criminal rate, the goverment [fm1,-] has adopted a series of effective measures to protect the security [cc3,3-] of the public's lives and property, and keep [vp5,s-] [wd4,1-2] social order. These measures make criminals get the well deserved punishment.   Another [wd3,d] one reflecting in the mental area is that the person who had ever been crime [wd7,s-] will lose all standing and reputation in the society. What he can gain are just the people's supercilious look and scorn. He also will meet a lot of difficulties in some aspects as finding [wd4,1-1] job, getting understanding of relatives and friends, making friends etc. He will also suffer from the great pressure of public opinion, which will cast a shadow on his life, and bring him all kinds of depressant [wd3,-] loss and sadness. It even can tore [vp9,1-] his confidence of life which is established difficulty into pieces [wd7,s-] On second thought, he has gained the forgiveness of the masses and lived [vp6,s-] in the normal way. But when he recollect [vp3,1-2] the past, he still can't drive the shadow off from his heart, and still be [vp7,s-] hurt by memories. As a result, he will become more sensitive and suspious [fm1,-] No doubt these can not bring hapiness [fm1,-] to him, that is to say he will take the cross all his life. On the other hand, the criminal will hurt his family to root [sn8,s] There are a lot of living examples which show the unhappy life of the criminal's family. It is difficult to remedy the mental pain of the family members, especially for the posterity, they [wd3,s-2] parents [np4,1-1] actions will give them deep influence, it has the close relation with their lives in the future.   In a word, crime does not pay. If you are a responsible person for yourself and your family, you should not yield to the impulse of evil. For seeking the happy life, the only way is that [sn8,s-] support yourself by your own labor and do everthing [fm1,-] honestly.  (t1-14)   "Crime does not pay" is a line [wd4,s-] comes from the mouth of a policeman in an old American detective film, which indicates that sooner or later the criminals will be sent to prison to answer what they have done.   In the modern society, crime has become a great threat to the public security. In America, the most democratic country, murder, robbery, rape or other crime occure [fm1,-] every few minutes. People lose their money, their property or even their lives. Crime has become a conspicuous social problem. In order to eliminate this deep-rooted "disease", anti-crime police forces have been set up, laws against criminals have been made, and it is public will that criminals should be severely punished. All these have made the criminals have fewer chances to escape the punishment.   When a crime is committed, the police will take all kinds of steps to capture the culprit. They serch [fm1,-] for the evidence which criminals have carelessly left behind and witnesses are welcome to provide necessary and important information or clues. Thanks to people's indignation [cc1,3-3] to the crime, they are willing to cooperate with the police and this makes their job more easier [aj3,1-] On the other hand, the culprits, after what they have done, are often extremely nervous. They have fear that others have noticed their scandal, or that the police have sensed their smell, or, if they have committed murder, they are afraid that the ghost of the victim will revenge. When they are being stared at, they are suspicuous that others [wd4,s-] aware of their sin. All these are heavy burdens that press hard on the criminals' heart. They are often haunted with terrible dreams, which make them suffer a lot since every sin brings its punishment with it, they have to answer for what they have done. Most of them end up in prison and have a miserable life. After they come out, they are looked down on by others and are deprived of many rights.   Not only the police [wd1,s-] try to give the criminals a just punishment, but also the family relations [wd3,s-] and friends of the victims, especially those who have lost their lives. These people are deeply shocked by the cruelty of the criminals and moan for their forever-lost friends. They demand that the criminals should be punished according to law. They unite and wage campaigns to remind people that as long as crime exists, their safety can no longer be guaranteed. They appeal the public for attention to this matter. The steps they take and the concencus [fm1,-] they produce are powerful. People are aware of the danger of crime, and fewed [fm1,-] and fewer criminals are able to be still at large.   God's mill grinds slow but sure.  (t1-15)   In the current world, two hundred and ninty-six [fm1,-] crimes are committed in an average [wd3,-1] minute. I have always being [vp9,2-1] wondering why our modern society, in which legal systems have been highly developed, still produces so many criminals who are so bold as to violate the law even at the risk of their lifes [fm2,-] But one thing is clear. Before and during offending against the law, they either possess the idea of being able to get away by chance, or reckon what they have done is worthwhile even if they get caught at last. I want to assure everybody however: Crime does not pay.   First we have to realize that justice has a long arm. With the perfecting of legal institutions day by day, it becomes more and more difficult for the criminals to escape the arm of the law. For instance, a person is murdered. Though [cj1,s-] advanced modern communication and transportation, medical experts and detectives can arrive at the scene only a few minutes after the murder is reported. In the meantime a thousand ways have been developed to provide enough clues of the unidentified murderers. Examinations on the dead body, study of footprints, fingerprints or any suspicious traces left on the scene can supply a lot of information about the murderers with the help of science [ad1,s-] Things are almost the same with bankrobbers, burglars, pick-pockets etc. Now with computerization of personal records and bettering of anti-crime facilities, criminals are sure to face more danger. In short, luck stays with criminals less frequently.   As an old saying goes: who [sn8,s-] swims in sins shall sink in sorrow. That is to say, even if your crime is unfound [wd7,-5] by luck or clever tactics, you cannot avoide [fm1,-] constant condemn[wd2,2-] from your conscience if you still have one [wd7,4-] A small proportion of criminals are psychologically abnormal. The abnormal [wd2,s-] itself is a state of unhappiness as far as I see it. Certainly this type of people are not paid by the crimes they commit. Some criminals may take offending the law as a pleasure and always enjoy doing it. I must say they may be able to escape from conscientious condemn, but they can never live a normal live [wd2,2-] since they do not have a sense of what is right or wrong. They are most likely to mingle among drug-abusers and sinister gangs and to destroy themselves completely sooner or later. Crime does not pay them too. For those who are predending [fm1,-] to be gentlemenlike, crime serves them right in an other [fm2,1-1] way. They usually have their hearts in their mouths all the time for fear that their crimes will be discovered sometime or another. So generally speaking, none of the criminals will not suffer from his crimes. They pay for them.   Some criminal may say "At least I've get [vp9,1-] rid of the person I hate, or I've spent all the money I've got from robbery, or I've done something I am long [cc3,-2] eager to do. I get paid in that way." I regret to say that you are too heavily shortsighted in that case. Life can be pretty nice and really long. However, you choose the least worthy way to enjoy it. You may be satisfied for a short period of time. But what is waiting for you may be immediate sentence to death or life-long suffering. Do you still think you are wise to do so?   Life pays everyone in different ways for the contribution he make [vp3,1-] to the society. But do mind this warning: Crime does not pay.  (t1-16)   Almost everyone in this world has an orientation to commit a crime, for it is the quickest way to make profit. But only a few would go to extremes by putting their ideas into practice. Thoes [fm1,-] who have received a systematic education will never set free their sudden impulse without any restraint, for they know crime does not pay.   For one thing, we are not individual beings. Everyone of us belongs to a certain group, a community or a society. We have obligations as well as rights. So it is very important for us to adjust our behaviour accordingly for the harmony of the majority. But there are still quite a number of uncultivated people [sn8,s-] [wd4,s-] ignore the existence of the law. For the interest of their own, they rob a bank or rape a woman at all hazards. In their naivety, they can transgress the law. They believe that they can make themselves a better life with their own doctrine. But, is it possible? Refering [fm2,-] to the history, they may discover things come out to be quite differently. No matter who you were, once you broke the law, you would get punishment sooner or later. Let us take Hitler as an example. In his prime day, he established an empire, which controled [fm2,-] half of the world. But his government, which was built on the basis of crime, could not long [ad1,s-] endure. As a result, this world's most famous criminal ended up his life by committing a suicide at the end of the war. So the cost for committing any crime is high and no criminal will come to a good end.   Secondly, a criminal's family members suffer a lot if he is put into prison or sentenced to death. Your wife and your child will feel humiliated if you are a prisoner. They will more or less be looked down upon in the society. Being a temporary widow, your wife has to pull [cc3,-3] the load alone. Moreover, you will have a guilty conscience for your family. After you turn over a new leaf, you will find you have lost too much.   Thirdly, crime can lead to the collapse of a society. To [wd4,1-2] certain extent, individual interests are closely connected to that of a society. If you live in a crime-flooded invironment [fm1,-] how can you expect to lead a peaceful life. During the cultural revolution, everything was in disorder. In such a chaos, many criminals went wild with joy. They did whatever they liked. But finally, they had to lapse themselves into melancholy, for they couldn't get anything through crime. In a large sense [cc4,2-] the campaign itself is a big crime. Everyone just experienced a nightmare, including those foolish criminals.   Taken [vp5,s-] all together, we all have the responsibility to obey the laws, for crime does not pay.  (t1-17)   Crime --- an offence which is punished by law, are [vp3,s-] not always punished by law. Many criminals are on the loose in spite of their guilt. So, does crime pay? No!   Generally, crime can be divided into two kinds according to its purpose. One is to obtain benifit [fm1,-] such as theft, embezzlement, robbery. Another [wd3,d] is to vent emotion, such as murder, arson, destroy [wd2,2-] All these crimes are punished, though not always by law. Justice has long arms.   During the Second World War, a little girl was missed [wd3,d] in London. His mother and friends looked for her everywhere. Scotland Yard even searched for her in whole Britain, but nothing was found. So her disappointed mother immigrated to Australia before long. In 1980's, the little girl's corpse was found in a pile of sand at her home's backyard. It turned out to be her mother who killed her! Scotland Yard sent out policemen to arrest that woman. But they were told that that poor woman had died no sooner after her immigration, because her [pr4,s-] could not bear the smiting of conscience.   Most of the criminals are punished by law, but still there are lots of criminals [sn8,s-] escape from the punishment of law. Many criminals hide them from the outside world, enjoying the benifits [fm1,-] which they obtained from their guilt. It seems they are happy. But it is not true. They are punished by another law --- a law of conscience. They dare not to enjoy life like others. Whenever they are walking in streets, dining in restaurants, sleeping in beds, they suffer from insomnia, addict [vp7,s-] to the drug, and wine. Some of them even become mad. They lead their lives like mice. What is the happy [wd2,1-] they can enjoy? So no sooner [cj2,s-] after their guilt, they are thrown into prison, some of them even go to see the God.   So we can say, crime does not pay.  (t1-18)   Before we discuss the issue, let's see [cc3,-4] a Chinese story first. "Once in ancient China, there was a man who wanted to steal his neighbour's gold bell hung on the wall. So one day he went there, [sn9,s-] in order not to let other's hear the bell ring, he covered his ears. So surely he was catched [fm2,-] as a thief."   This story sounds funny, but committing a crime is just like stealing other's bell by covering his own ears. For, as we know crime doesn't pay.   Firstly, let's analyse the root of crime. We can say crime is out of revenge on somebody on a strong desire to meet needs which can't not [wd5,1-] be realized through the usual way. The pleasure of these [np9,-1] revenge and realization of these needs are just contemporary. What a criminal has obtained must be paid with his own life and his own interest. Those who killed others will too [ad1,s-] be killed, [sn9,s-] those who stole, did harm to others will be sent into prison. Like other things, there is a balance maintained by laws and regulations.   Secondly, materially say [vp4,s-] not all the crimes can attain their aims. In order to revenge, to obtain something, the criminals have to venture his [pr3,s-] own lives and interest. Very likely the criminals came back home with empty hands. Sometimes they wanted to kill a person but only disabled him, Sometimes they wanted to steal $10,000, but only got $100, Sometimes [fm3,s-] they implied to light a house but the fire was put out. To commit a crime is not like planting some vegetables, which can give you a plumber [fm1,-1] harvest in autumn. It is actually "No pains, no gains."   Thirdly, we should consider the pschological [fm1,-] influence to a criminal. Criminals, for the sake of their fame, future, must shoulder the pressure of not being found, being sucessful [fm1,-] at one time, etc. Even [wd4,s-] they had obtained [vp6,s-] what they wanted they face the blame of their own conscience, and public opinion. I want to illustrate this with a German story: A doctor killed his wife because he didn't love her, [sn9,s-] before the girl died, she vomited some blood on the doctor's arm. So each month the doctor had to go to the hospital to get that part of his arm cut off. At last, the doctor died in a year. No doubt, although the doctor killed his wife, he can't [vp9,s-] stand the denouncement of his own conscience.   In conclusion, I want to say that life for everybody is equal. Within our lives, we have many opportunies [fm1,-] to make a fame, to make our lives more confortable [fm1,-] that is "Every dog has his day." Thus, we must grasp these opportunies [fm1,-] but not committing [vp4,s-] a crime, for our life, for our future.  (t1-19)   Crime does not pay, on the contrary, it is a heavy [cc4,-1] price to pay for.   Objections might be raised against this point of view. Some people believe they will surely benefit from crime without any responsibility concerned.   I will not deny the fact that some criminals did get money, valuables, or, reputation which they longed for. Some of them made their fortune so quickly without being seized that you might feel jealous of them. However, if you personally think that you would rather be a rich criminal than a poor gentleman, you are just misplacing your concern. It is money, fame and comfort that attract your attention, making you forget about the evil consequences stemmed from crime. Actually, their happiness and wealth are temporary. I see no advantages in this foolish behaviour. In the long run, it goes without saying that crime does not pay. The Reasons are as follows:   To begin with, as a criminal, if you are unlucky to be captured and sentenced, either imprisonment or death awaits. For such a man without freedom, there can be no doubt that you are to be deprived of the boundless prospects.   In addition, as a result of your behaviour, your beloved relatives are to be influenced, especially your children, for they have been mentally injured. They feel humiliating and ashamed. It is their parent who casts the shadow on them. It will remain for a long time, in some cases, even all through one's life.   On the other hand, if you have not been caught yet, even though you are very likely not to be discovered all your life, in that circumstance, could you feel secure and easy? Once you committed a crime, you placed yourself in danger. So long as you are a criminal with a touch of conscience, you will always feel guilty, and such a feeling won't bring you happiness and comfort. No matter how cruel you [sn8,s-] are, even the cruelest murderer will be seized with fear all the time; will be in a constant state of anxiety. Every night you pray to God for help but hardly can you have a sound sleep. You endlessly worry about your tomorrow; you are afraid of going out to street for fear that a policeman will approach you. These lingering mental tortures are also kind of loss of freedom, and a high price to pay for your crime.   Furthermore, the temporary benefit we might receive from crime is not at all worth your [sn8,s-] risk.   Taken [vp5,s-] all together, you will admit that crime does not pay, but asks you to pay.   As a matter of fact, most criminals could not escape from punishment. Therefore, I see no reason for a clever citizen to be a humble criminal in order to make his success more quickly. Crime is really a greedy devil. Those who have been lured by him get a fraction of his property at first, but couldn't escape from its control unless they pay him back their youth, wealth, or lives. You won't expect such an end, will you?   In conclusion, we can say that, both criminals and victims receive no benefit but sufferings from crime. There are many ways to achieve our goals, and committing a crime is certainly not our choice.  (t1-20)   Fascinated by a flood of popular criminal novels or films, such as God Father or The Color of Money, many young people believe that crime committing is an efficient short-cut towards wealth. They take it for granted that so long as they can rapidly get as rich as these heroes who own luxurious villaes and drive a Benz car, anything can be done, including crime. But is that true? Is that a reality that as long as you get much money after the crime, you can feel on top of the world? My answer is no.   Crime does not pay.   Without question, some people may get rich after their drug-smuggling or corruption, but if you consider the risks they are taking, you will probably get a clear picture of what crime committing is. Yes, they are risking their lives, their family and their fame. Life is so precious to us that no one is allowed to risk it in crime. We should save it for something more glorious. Besides, Crime committing is not always an easy thing, I should say. You have to make elaborate plan [np6,2-] constantly be alert of [wd3,1-] any unexpected accident, and even risk your life if you fail. Police may emerge in front of you at any moment; witnesses may scream; victims may call for help; your figerprint [fm1,-] or feetprint [fm2,-] may be left behind --- any of these will lead to crime failure and thus you are done for. Can anyone pay you for that? I doubt.   If you still stubbonly [fm1,-] maintain that money is worth risk-taking in crime. I will have to suggest you to think about the consequence of a crime. Let's assume you succeed in a crime committing and you can own anything you have longed for. But since a crime is done [cc2,2-] and it can not be undone [cc2,8-] it impairs other's property, interest and the right to be alike [wd7,2-] not matter [cj2,s-] you admit it or not. It offenses the law which is unanimously recognized correct [wd4,-] by the general public. So what you did it [sn8,s-] wrong anywhere. As a consequence, even when you are driving a limousine and trying to enjoy it, a feeling of guilty [wd2,1-] will cross your mind from [wd5,s-] now and then, and this is entirely beyond your experience and personality. Can you get paid for that? The fear of being discovered is haunting around you, anytime, anywhere. You lose the priceless peace in mind. Even you can own the most expensive yacht, the voice of your conscience will mutter to your ears intermittently. At this stage, you will have to live a Jake-and-Hyde life. Your life consists of nothing but escape --- escape from being pursuied [fm1,-] escape from being discovered. Once you commit a crime, you are condemned to a [np7,-1] unrest [wd2,1-1] life, both physically and spiritually. Are you still sure you can pay for that?   Accordingly, crime does not pay. If we stop any thoughts of those venal practices, we will find a much better and promising future is waiting for us.
