However, in fact [wd5,3-] , fresh water is of [wd3,1-3] rather [ad2,-1] shortage in the world today. Many factors can be accounted into [vp2,3-] . First, with the incress [fm1,-] of the population of the world, we need more fresh water. Besides, there will be a greater demand for fresh water in industries with the progress of the modernization. The most important factor must be that we have polluted the water resource so seriously that there is less fresh water available today. In my opinion, we must take steps to deal with this problem immediately. For example, government should establish ragulations [fm1,-] to prevent the fresh water from being polluted. Besides, scientists should invent some methods to cycle [wd3,s-] the fresh water. Furthermore, [wdd,-2] government should educate [vp1,s-] the people that fresh water is of [wd3,1-1] shortage and everyone has the duty to prevent the fresh water from being polluted.
